Biden is a racist and a sexual predator haha but you keep calling him decent. Please do your research before you call Biden decent. Ask the hundreds of thousands of people who were victims of his mass incarceration bill how decent he is...just stop man!!
I honestly have no preference in this election. Much like in 2016, it proves the two party system is the biggest flaw in our political system. Trump is terrible, and Biden is a joke as well so I will probably vote for the 3rd party candidate again ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Biden slams Trump, McConnell for 'political games' with further coronavirus aid  via
His grandchild that Hunter had out of wed-lock but denied could have possibly helped him, but I‚Äôll bet he has never seen her once! Just some low-class trash that should have been aborted. Joe ‚ÄúArchie Bunker‚Äù Biden for President. As for me, I‚Äôll vote to keep what I have.
One would think that being in office for 8 years would have given him the opportunity to do this.  I‚Äôm sure Biden widen will make it happen... oh wait he was a Senator for 37 years.
There is no world where Biden is ahead of/even with Cooper.
He was a Dem his whole carreer and was highest ranking senator prior to his death (Biden spoke at his funeral)...  He voted NAY on the 1964 civil rights act (vote roll pictured below)...
This is only because he thinks he may lose. Any time he's behind in the polls, he calls it fake news. Should Biden win, we all know he's going to claim the polls were rigged. It's like he can't accept fault in any way, shape, and/or form.
But see, Democrats can do that because they aren‚Äôt racist like Republicans. And he‚Äôs excused for everything else he has said and done that was racist in his past because he is Democrat. Yeah, that Barak is certainly a clean and well-spoken black. Joe ‚ÄúArchie Bunker‚Äù Biden.
I see. I think November will be a lose/lose for our country. Sleepy Joe is a joke. Trump thrives off this power which isn‚Äôt what you want. Narcissistic af. Starts shit. Atleast he‚Äôs mentally aware tho. Biden 4 prez is elder abuse at this point
And if Biden wins you get to live in a Communist Country and live in a city looking like Portland does now. You want be able to piss unless the government allows you.
Yeah. If you look at the odds though, they also predict (strongly) Biden dropping out before the election. So, maybe not all is lost
The betting odds are in Biden‚Äôs favor, though. It‚Äôs not a good sign

You are preaching to the choir respectfully. The real question is if enough people who watched feel like we do. I hate to say it, but if this country elects Joe Biden and the rest of them, then we will get what we deserve.

I'm sure the Biden folks really like me. LOL
Sure thing....has soon as America prosecutes Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, McCabe, Peter Strzok, Clapper, Brennan, and James Comey.  John Durham's got facts and evidence against these Democrat crooks and all Democrats have against Trump is accusations.
No way Trump can win, Joe Biden has a 22 point lead and he's coasting to the WH...regardless of his VP pick.
Joe Biden is awesome. He can do more from a basement than fatass wandering aimlessly around photo-ops.
I‚Äôm definitely with Biden and he will make a good president. Can‚Äôt wait to see his VP pick!!
No he does not. In fact one can argue that Biden is more responsible than any other politician left or right for mass incarcerations. His crime bill that he pushed for was extremely draconian. Research it, even Reagan was against it and Biden pushed it

As much as I want Joe Biden to win,  I am bombarded daily with emails asking for money from every prominent Dem there is. Doesn‚Äôt matter if I just donated. They want more. Sure, a campaign takes a ton of money, but I am not an unending source.
Biden fails to see that every person is human. That means there is one race, not many.
With fewer than 100 days until the presidential election, presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden has announced he will choose his running mate next week.
No one could do worse than Trump if they actively tried. Someone that did NOTHING would have done a better job than the guy that downplayed the virus, refused to wear a mask, and claims Nazis are "very fine people". I also doubt Biden would be taking advice from Dr. Demon Sperm.
Guys seriously where is Trumps version of Joe Biden? Can we please elect that version of Joe Biden? Like I will do some very questionable and unethical shit for that version of Joe Biden. Meanwhile in reality our two choices are an establishment Dem and Putin‚Äôs bottom bitch

That depends on whether the voter in question would consider voting for Biden or Trump or not voting at all rather than voting for a third party candidate. Many 3rd party voters would choose to not vote if their only options were GOP/DEM. No need to pick the lesser of two evils.

Biden seems like the better alternative to the inept orange con man currently in the White House.
I‚Äôm been thinking about it and the only president I can think of who was definitely not racist was Obama. Almost president Bobby Kennedy as well but he was killed before he could become president. I‚Äôm hoping Stacey Abrams is VP and Biden steps aside after first term.
Biden forgot it was Obama, who was the most racist person!. something something Hunter Biden?
Biden just listened to a woman and a Black man, his best friend. This was amazing.

Every VP has dreams of being President. Hell, Kamala just ran for POTUS! However, she would never undercut Biden once selected as VP.
That's insane. Biden will top 400 electoral votes &amp; the Democrats will take the Senate. Trump has destroyed the Republican party.
Biden's going to stop Marxism with a little stutter and a calm demeanor

I think there‚Äôs so much 3D chess going on that Karen Bass being ‚Äúshort-listed‚Äù is part of a plan to make her Kamala‚Äôs Senate replacement. I mean, she‚Äôs a worthy VP candidate for sure, but Biden adding another CA option doesn‚Äôt make much sense otherwise.
Is it so hard for Biden to announce that he‚Äôd be in favor of a UBI study? That alone would go a long way with progressives... i.e. to vote for him, to fight for him. Upside - they learn, become more receptive; downside - really none, other than the cost of said study.
i‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll just have Biden do another Medium post instead.  That‚Äôs more their speed
The crime bill talking point is so tired. Anyone that‚Äôs actually been following knows that Biden has learned since that racism is much further reaching than he had thought in 1994
I mean, Biden‚Äôs not opting for secret police kidnapping random civilians and won‚Äôt demonize the press for starters
I can assure you, the majority of Americans will vote for Joe Biden.

Joe Biden has literally been running for president for over 30 years. Fine.  But let a woman move toward the presidency and all of a sudden she's "too ambitious".  Make that make sense.
Every time I hear someone like "What about how Harris attacked Biden in that debate? How will they ever get past that?", I have a sudden urge to give that person a Baby Shark coloring book and a box of crayons.
I'm just gonna put this here again.  Joe Biden is not stupid, and he cares about his legacy.
I live in Chapel Hill. When Biden takes over, please don't let America swing "left" too fast or too far. We need moderate bipartisan leadership.
Does anyone else thinking that Karen Bass got put on Biden‚Äôs short list to raise her profile for when she gets appointed as Kamala Harris‚Äôs Senate replacement?  Bass is a worthy choice on her own merits, obviously, but the timing of her ‚Äúaddition‚Äù makes more sense as Senate prep.

If you don‚Äôt wanna vote, fine. I‚Äôm not even gonna try to sell you on Biden. That‚Äôs not my job. But assuming you wish to vote out Trump, this is your chance to do so. Act accordingly
Also, as a show of support, we should all donate on the day of the announcement if we can. A blowout fundraising day for Biden will help set a national narrative.

The Biden campaign has done at least one major event with all the big Dem candidates, which I think is good. I just think it‚Äôs interesting because it was such a big field, and they‚Äôre all doing so much. I know they usually all do some surrogacy. But this seems extra.
It sure isn‚Äôt.  Biden said he would veto M4A himself, and there‚Äôs a revolt at the convention brewing over it.  Also I can hold the Dems to account AND oppose Trump at the same time.  It‚Äôs really quite easy.  Your willingness to settle is why we have a mediocre candidate
The new bullshit defund the police ads from Trump amaze me. Like not only does Joe Biden not support the movement (unfortunately), at this point Trump is literally just running on scaring old people into voting for him.

From the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.   If trump‚Äôs  followers are going to insist that a Biden presidency will drive the Country toward Marxism, we might as well understand both sides before we vote and decide on our future.
All we can do is keep the protests up once Biden is in.  I think if people see police brutality continuing under a Dem president we might see the mass movement necessary to topple at least a few of these oppressive structures
The funny thing is, that primary candidate list doesn‚Äôt change whether or not Biden wins this one.  Which should really clue people in on how feckless his time in power is likely to be.  No illusions here
The far left radixal libs are delusional and Anerica is sick of their toxic ideologies and backwards morality. Joe Biden should be behind bars according to the ‚Äòget tough in crime‚Äô bill he hinself passed with Slick Willy

I get it. Yang‚Äôs supporters are all over the map. Many disaffected Republicans and independents and many staunch progressives.  However, I think most are Biden now, especially as Yang is championing Biden more and Trump self sabotaging himself.

Hey, everybody, everywhere, give, even five bucks, to the Biden campaign. Let‚Äôs defeat Trump across the map and on every front.

You are going to see lots of arrests when Biden takes over!
The performative military budget cut is irritating af to those of us in NC, where we not only want Joe Biden to win, but also have a Senate seat in play and at least 3 potential House pickups, to say nothing of our state and local races. It‚Äôs an empty, counterproductive gesture.
I don‚Äôt think either Biden or Pelosi, who have taken tens of millions from big pharma, are particularly interested in taking on drug prices either
I know who didn‚Äôt......JOE BIDEN.  It‚Äôs all over for Trump and Trumpism.
It is time to make this happen, and it won't under the Republicans:  Biden Calls For End To Waiting Lists For Medicaid Waivers
nobody is going to notice your brave stand against voting because sadly 90% of Bernie supporters are voting for Biden according to the polls.  You‚Äôre using March‚Äôs talking points but it‚Äôs July.  The chance to withold our votes and doom Biden has gone
Many have trusted you through 20,000 verified lies, bowing to Russia,  deaths thru your actions, and an estimated 120,000 deaths due to your inaction. We have seen you act above the law and the constitution.  Some of us are tired!  Welcome Joe Biden!  #TraitorTrump
Yeah I hear you, and I do hope you‚Äôre right.  I wish Bernie hadn‚Äôt surrendered so early ‚Äî or better yet threatened a third party run unless Biden endorsed M4A.  Next time we need someone who sees the party as an enemy, not a friend to conciliate
No argument on that here.  How do you aim to accomplish that with 90% of Bernie‚Äôs supporters voting for Biden?  No one is even going to notice your principled third party vote or whatever.  The third most powerful Dem in Congress got toppled by a principal endorsed by DSA
Well since she‚Äôs literally the face of Trump‚Äôs anti Biden campaign, it hardly matters.  What does matter is that she is tirelessly pursuing our priorities.  Favorability will increase as left media begins to put money behind her.  I mean, Bernie lost a ton of favorability too
NYTimes has maps of Biden &amp; Trump donors by zip code. Triangle doing some heavy lifting for the blue.
"Whether I'm his running mate or I'm a door-knocker, I don't mind. I'm going to do everything I can to help get Joe Biden elected and to help him succeed as president."  Susan Rice has never held an elected office. But she's on Joe Biden's VP shortlist.
I realize this goes without saying but I'll say it anyway:  If Netflix had damning footage on Biden, the GOP would have sued to have it aired immediately or failing that, STOLEN it and aired it at a "coronavirus briefing".
üòÇYeah, a career civil servant and successful VP for 8 years was a creep and it‚Äôs just NOW coming out. All this as Trump had rape charges filed by a 13 yo involving him and Epstein.  Show pics of Biden with ghislaine and Epstein.  That‚Äôs right, THERE AREN‚ÄôT ANY.  Project much?
I‚Äôm pretty sure Biden lived through some of the other ones
How exactly does the Biden plan use market forces?  Not quite seeing it through the federal planning.
We don‚Äôt need to watch Biden - He‚Äôs the one winning without spewing crap out of his mouth.

This is not Joe Biden‚Äôs America. It is Trump‚Äôs Amerika Casino going bankrupt. #TrumpIsLosing
. has Biden up 51-38 in Florida.
Biden says Trump is the only racist ever elected president. Good God okd man, how about Andrew Jackson? But better, Bill Clinton!?:  BADTA, GATT2, Bank Reform &amp; Welfare reform sent jobs abroad, caused massive foreclosures, safety net, doubled jail populations: people of color (1)
Honestly at this point I'm j getting ready for 4 more years of trump because all of us hate biden but he's the only one that will realistically beat trump given america's shit political environment like good luck convincing boomer centrists to vote third party
Is there a reason why the news media is dead-set on talking about gaffes and not Biden's revolutionary plan to make dependency more affordable, whether it be for young children or elderly relatives?
Joe Biden has an obligation to take the test? You mean like Trump‚Äôs obligation to release his tax returns?
This is not Joe Biden‚Äôs America. It is Donald Trump‚Äôs latest failed casino.  #TrumpVirus #TrumpGestapo
Look this didn‚Äôt even start with me saying ‚ÄúTrump is racist.‚Äù In fact, if you‚Äôll look, my main comment on the original Biden comment was that what Biden said was idiotic.
Remembering late Ct Sen#AbrahamRibicoff who told it like it was, called out Chicago Mayor Daley 4 "Gestapo tactics" in '68 Dem convention. Portland mayor Wheeler &amp; POTUS aspirant Biden fall back on wussy word "egregious" - what a member of a stuffy Brit social club might sayY‚Äôall are a bunch of damn haters.  How much did Hunter Biden make in his Daddy‚Äôs illegal arrangement with a freaking UKRAINE oil company?  How much did the Clintons launder through their foundation?  At least they made their money on the USA.  Hypocrites!!!!
I think the VP should be Duckworth. She can hit Trump hard on his failure to protect our troops from Russian bounties ‚Äî or even address it. While Biden goes after them on everything else at home.  I want Harris for AG. And I want her to go after Kushner, Miller, and the lot.
Clinton, Obama and Biden all have credibility problems.  A record of false promises and lies.  If you would like to continue with being lied too, your choice is easy.
I‚Äôm going to vote for Biden because I‚Äôm not under the illusion any more that a man can win the 2020 election without also having been an abuser.   I detest Biden but at this point I‚Äôm choosing him because I think he will cause less deaths. Not less sexual assault but less dying.
Lol- more people there than in Biden‚Äôs basement ü§£üòÇ
I can‚Äôt believe the Biden camp is seriously considering her.  They must‚Äôve known this before it got out.  Plenty of people would inflate the level of interest to make Biden look bad.   My money is still on Kamala Harris.
Yeah‚Ä¶  I think I‚Äôm in the Susan Rice camp. She can almost immediately mend ties overseas. Trump and his cronies will scream Benghazi, but if you believe in that narrative, you weren‚Äôt voting for Biden anyway.
Oh good lord.  I hope Biden is not foolish enough to pick this person -plays right into trumps hands. üôÑüôÑ kamala is the choice
Trump wanted Bernie so bad in the general that the new campaign strategy is literally to pretend Biden is Bernie. He knows he‚Äôll lose to a moderate, that‚Äôs why he wants to paint him as an extremist, which is just delusional.
I agree but some people want to try to brand it as a negative because they don‚Äôt want her to be Biden‚Äôs VP pick.That‚Äôs all it is.
It‚Äôs a stupid claim to try and brand her as someone who would not be focused on the now if she was VP in a Biden presidency and looking ahead to possibly get the big job someday. Someone - especially a woman - being labeled as being ‚Äútoo ambitious‚Äù as a slight is ridiculous.
Oh we will know. A landslide victory for Joe Biden. How will #CrybabyTrump handle that?
The fact that Ed Rendell has successfully weasled himself back into relevancy for at least the next six months is itself the most damning argument against ‚ÄúJoe Biden is progressive now, really, he is, stop laughing‚Äù
Did everyone unfamiliar with the process just decide they are experts qualified to critique it?  When there is nothing at all different or unusual, other than Biden narrowing it to women, which he did 4 months ago?  Welcome to the game, Noah!
We are Draining the Russian Swap in the White House alright. You will be gone in January 2021.                                   Polls: Trump 39 - Biden 59
Seriously?   Hey other old white dudes... Biden‚Äôs successor will not be one of us. Deal with it, ok?
Biden literally said he sees himself as a bridge‚Äîhe KNOWS that the VP can and should be a part of the bridge by being someone who can and should run for President in 2024 or 2028. This particular loyalty litmus test reeks of misogynoir AND trumpism
This is perhaps the most misogynoir-esque part of it: demanding loyalty by promising not to run? VPs have almost always run, including Biden, and weren‚Äôt considered disloyal for that ambition. Those Veeps were all white guys &amp; here we are talking about Black women. Just üòí
Remember she called Joe Biden a racist.  now she want to be his number üí©
The one candidate who has been most effective at quelling the rise of progressivism of the left hasn‚Äôt been anyone on the right. It has been Biden.
The good news, GOP controls legislatures in 30 states, so only blue states would mandate mail-in voting &amp; Biden will win those anyway.
‚ÄúShe‚Äôll *only* focus on becoming president if she becomes VP‚Äù - how do you think administrations work exactly? This isn‚Äôt Richard III, Macbeth, or anything else from Shakespeare where she‚Äôs been plotting to murder Biden via soliloquys and talking to ghosts this whole time.
She has superb legislative skills, but that‚Äôs not especially useful for someone like Biden. Hire to your weaknesses.
Kampala Harris is a perfomative ally just like Biden. So it makes sense.
If Dems seriously think they can win the Presidency this year, would they still be hanging on to Biden? Or are they waiting for the VP pick &amp; convention, then dump him? Do they really think Kamala Harris will fire up voters? She couldn't even win 1 delegate.
Gee, I am guessing Fox News will never bother to apologize to Vice President Biden for his now proven 100% CORRECT statement. #FOXNEWSLIES #DumpTrump2020 #PutinsPuppet #TraitorTrump #VoteBlue

Biden is the MOST RACIST. WHAT BS
Could this be why Untruthful political ads portraying Joe Biden supporting defunding the Police? Trump has readied and deployed Federall Department of Homeland Security personnel on American streets.
He forgot. He had early onset Biden dementia
How we feel seeing people who actually support Biden
Very small brain of you to presume I support Donald because I dislike Biden. Nice identity politics you have there. Hows the two-party system treating you? I noticed the DNC really picked the most talented candidate this year LMFAO

Hi Reverend. Thank you for reaching out! Moses, who handles our Believers for Biden program, will be reaching out to you shortly!
close to  in ideology,   has proven she can go toe-to-toe with Trump and Pence, and not back down during the fight for Presidency.  Biden/Harris!
Joe Biden's campaign strategy really is "Be quiet, and let Trump talk himself into a corner"
what‚Äôs the point of voting for the people who made Trumpism possible? they are going to make actual fascism happen if Biden gets back in office. people are so conned out of just supporting politicians they agree with. pathetic.
Can‚Äôt wait to see y‚Äôall meet President Biden next April #dukembb
I think it means he has one more thing in common with Joe Biden other than old age!
Same victim BS Trump GOP uses.  Obama / Biden failed America and HRC lost running on that failed War and Wall Street status quo.
neither am I. *quietly holds her Biden flag*
I've seen the same Biden ad 4 times this morning.  It's from a PAC and it's a really good ad.  His ads always are upbeat unlike the buffoon's who uses scary tactics.
Michigan's 11th District is located in the suburbs outside Detroit. Democrat  flipped this seat in 2018 by a pretty decent margin and it seems quite likely to vote for Biden. This is a district where Dems did better in 2018 than Gary Peters did in 2014.
Joe Biden, Jr ... I am glad you qualified that ...‚Äùwhen I‚Äôm president‚Äù. Not to worry!
Joe Biden is a witch. He steals conservative babies at night and gives them to Bernie and during the day he steals progressive babies and feeds them to the Lincoln Project.
I‚Äôm 32 and someone in their early 20s feels like a child.
I don't follow. Only in 2008 did a D crack 10% margin in the last 5 prez elections. Gophers consistently blue, but not by large margins. Biden +10 is a pretty damn big lead.  Do you mean you think he needs to be up 15 to account for shenanigans?
LOL üòÜ!! Denied WHAT!! That police haven‚Äôt got killed, blinded for life and hurt? WOW what a Great country biden could make this Country into another Cuba üá®üá∫, Samalia where the corruption of ohmar is from!! He gallows the footsteps of polosi ,AOC and the 3 STOOGES!! Very SAD üò¢!!
After the last Republican Administration created the Great Recession, Obama and Biden came in and led the country‚Äôs recovery.
Yes the war will start probably if biden gets 4 years!! The riots will get worse with getting rid of police departments like all these liberal cities and states want!! These aren‚Äôt Democratic ideas , these are liberal-socialists ideas !! Bankrupt cities and riots gone WILD üòú SAD
Yes the hussein obama and biden administration has done great Crimea and harm to our great Country!! What FAILURES we put in office!! Lots of corruption in their administration!! Shame on them!! Now biden is running for President to finish all the harm they didn‚Äôt finish!! SAD üò¢
Yes a lot of BAD KARMA!! Giving Russia üá∑üá∫ and China üá®üá≥ everything they ever dreamed of except biden making his little boy billions!! How corrupt can politicians get? Now biden pushing AMERICANS noses in it, after all harm biden has done to AMERICANS!! CAMPAIGN STRATEGY RACIST,SAD
Yes, That‚Äôs what‚Äôs so great about our PRESIDENT is walking the walk not talking the talk!! Like completing all CAMPAIGN PROMISES , hussein obama and biden administration divided AMERICANS not completing any CAMPAIGN PROMISES !! Solar panels contracts to the rich for millions!SAD!
Antifa boy , Biden has a better chance of being indicted than winning in November.

If ‚Äúconservative ‚Äú talk radio and Trump‚Äôs supporters had only held him accountable. Telling people who care about the issues and not the person , per say , to vote for Biden is lame . We would never . Trump must step it up and govern better to win . Hope he does .

Gooseberry says MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN by voting for Joe Biden.
Kinda creepy like Biden eh?
Correct. Two corrupt parties owned by Wall Street. Biden is Blue Trump w/o the narcissistic sociopathy of Trump.
Has anyone in the left consider the remote possibility that #Trump operatives are laying the groundwork to upend a possible #Biden presidency with precisely the same tactics and strategy #Democrats used for last 4 years against Trump? #ScaryThoughtRight
"More Americans think that Democrat Joe Biden will likely win in November (41%) rather than President Trump (37%). This is in line with findings last month (Biden 42%, Trump 38%)."  Older &amp; diff surveys showed people thought Trump was more likely to win.
Expect the info to come out as part of October surprise on Biden.
No one in NC thinks Biden wins NC. I can't get one Democrat to take even a $10 bet he beats Trump in NC. Bill Clinton lost NC twice. Hillary once. Obama lost NC in 2012. Barely beat weak McCain by 14,000 in 2008. Biden ain't any of them. He loses NC big
GOP criminality means that we are always far behind.  Voter suppression, gerrymandering, pushback against mail-in voting, the elimination of polling sites, and Russian cyber-shenanigans‚Äîall remove any possibility of a level playing field.    #FridayFeeling
I think scripture elevates  character over policy differences, the character, conduct and competency of Biden is much preferred over Trump. Christians can work for issues they care about with democrats but should never say someone like Trump represents us.
First, you said Biden wasn't racist.  Second, Trump is a moron that doesn't deserve the office.  Third, Trump's base is not energized by racism. They are energized by the rabid, constant criticism of racism. They see him treated like they are treated and they identify with him.
Biden 110%. Clowns scare me.
Fact check: Joe Biden didn't take a knee upon seeing a flag; he was talking to a child  via
Pupper Joe Biden acts like he's just napping on my book, and he'd never drag it outside, rip the dust jacket off, and chew on the hardcover...but he's done that at least 15 times.  I need to be better about putting my books away. Great read by  highly recommend.
I would like to know them NOW! Bye don!!! Biden!
Oh no! Is Scientific Realm‚Äôs social media intern tweeting without checking with ANYONE who was paying attention from 2008-2016?! Maybe you should do a quick search of Standing Rock or the Southern Border &amp; see how ‚Äúprotests‚Äù were handled by Biden‚Äôs last WH administration?
Is Biden copping a feel in that picture?
That doesn't matter once Biden is in
You have got to be out of your mind! Trump is having his storm troopers beat up moms in Portland. Trump's failure of leadership has allowed the Coronavirus to rapidly spread across America. Our GDP dropped 32% because of Trump's failures. Biden will stop the bleeding Trump caused
mfs who prefer american dad to family guy are biden bootlickers
I‚Äôm an atheist but at times I utter ‚ÄúThank God‚Äù, mostly out of habit.  I‚Äôd vote for a lamp post over Trump, but not too thrilled Biden once considered naming a F- Republican as his VP. Both Obama and Biden favor neoliberal policies.

Look at 2016 my man. The average of polls was off by 1.2 points from the final result. If that were the case today, Biden would win the popular vote by 7.1 points. No way Trump eeks out an electoral college win with that margin.
Former Sr. advisor to President Obama, Valerie Jarrett, talks #VOTE2020 with us tonight after hosting a Biden campaign event with NC city and state leaders. #abc11
Instead of cherry-picking polls you should look at the average in 2016 vs the average in 2020.  2016: Clinton +3.3 2020: Biden +8.3
2.2 million were supposed to die. 150,000 is considerably less than 2.2 million. Ban on flights coming from China, Europe. Biden said Trump was wrong for that for two months. Nancy and Bill telling everyone to go out and have fun in enclosed spaces. Your hate is misguided.
I can‚Äôt stand Hollywood.  I just finished the Epstein doc on Netflix.  It TRIED to tie Trump to Epstein (failing miserably), and did not include a SINGLE GD interview or mention of the accuser who says Epstein &amp; Maxwell sold her to John McCain and Joe Biden through a DC madam...
I‚Äôm starting to have a hard time telling the difference between real Joe Biden tweets and parody Joe Biden tweets.
Like I said. Keep believing Biden's 8-point lead isn't real. You probably don't even need to vote since Trump will win so easily.
Biden for President!!!!!
If Kansas is close at the presidential level, that suggests Biden is doing extremely well with rural white voters and headed towards an electoral landslide. KS is only slightly more educated than the US as a whole. The real secret to Laura Kelly's win was rural voters.
Biden VP Pick Odds: Kamala Harris Odds Surge To Best Ever
Yes, keep thinking Biden's 8-point lead in the polls is wrong.
Would say it's quite unlikely Republicans get locked out and she would have zero shot at defeating him. One of those districts that could be competitive in a Biden midterm if there's no incumbent.
Kamala Harris most likely being Biden VP pick has me fucking depressed as shit rn
1) *whose, not who's 2) No one has to physically remove him, moron.  He won't be POTUS any more.  He'll just be a guy.  If, for some reason, he stays in the Oval Office (won't happen), he gets arrested by the Secret Service, or Biden just lets him hang out.
I think that pres number is too rosy. Walz won his district by about 3% in 2018. For Biden to win MN-1, he'd probably have to win statewide by at least 15 points and I don't see that as realistic. 10? I can see that. 15? Eh.
It's soothing to listen to you President Biden. More of us than trumpets. I believe this election will really be a blue wave.....‚úå
Why Biden is ahead in the polls.  All democrats do is spread fear.
Thank God. #Biden
I'm a huge  fan already but if his voting rights group pays off Florida felons restitution so they can vote and that tips Florida Biden's way which then flips the national election Biden's way, I think that makes him the GOAT in my book.
This man is absolutely everything our country was founded against. #AnyoneButTrump2020
It's all up to us if we want to allow Trump to "cancel" or "postpone" the election, or let him try to contest the results. When Biden wins an overwhelming victory on election night, which will be held on Tuesday, November 3rd, and then he will be inaugurated in January, period.
So Pelosi will be president until Biden gets it
That long sigh after saying he's voting for Biden...that's where I am too. I dont know if the Republican party has come completely unmoored or I'm just seeing what has always been there just under the surface, but the last 4 years have been insanely disappointing to this former R

Steven Calabresi will vote for Donald Trump in November. He will release a statement regarding some innocuous, dem boiler plate thing Biden says as a reason , that despite Trumps personal abhorrence, the radical agenda of Biden is just too dangerous for the nation to endure.
I just had a truly disheartening thought: we are so focused on electing Biden we have convinced ourselves that he will right this ship and we can go back to our normal basic disinterest of government. What if ü§° has disrupted things so badly we can‚Äôt get back there?!
I do not want to vote for Trump or Biden... need another option. #vote
Please vote for Joe Biden in November so we can figure out what the next best steps are for this country. Because another four years of Trump will be when the real nightmare begins.
You don‚Äôt like those people‚Äôs politics. How are those people under minding our democracy?  And how is the Joe Biden nomination anything like the trump nomination? One a former VP, former longtime senator; they other a reality TV show host.
why did you lie to the American people again. Voter suppression is a hallmark of the democratic party.  It is time to bring you to justice and lock you up in prison along with Clinton, Biden,
Hillary was leading by 3.3 points in the 2016 polls. Biden is up by 8.3.
Yeah there is no doubt in my mind, I'm all in for Biden. Which I recognize is stupid because he's a worse version of HC. I'm an idiot, but at least I'm trying to learn.
Biden should keep doing what he's doing because he's leading by over 8 points.
That's what I just said. Some polls are double digits. The average of all polls right now is Biden +8.3.
Lol patriot. The Wall Street patriot? The GM &amp; Ford Patriot? Unforgiving outrage that has gave way to what... a Netflix deal?

Lmao, she‚Äôs gonna tank Biden‚Äôs chances at winning. Swing voters don‚Äôt want that race hustler.
There's a lot to unwind. I suspect Biden will do it quickly and have a transition team in place unlike Trump in 16.  It's hard to fathom how much damage they *didn't* cause due to their ineptitude.
With  appearing at the  convention, imagine if GWB also jumped in, and then endorsed Biden. I'm sure some Dems would freak out, but it's not out of the realm of the possible.
Y‚Äôall, Obama about to bring the fire until Biden wins in November.
Nazi Cooper has everyone is locked in their house and Biden is locked in his basement until end of November. This is fucking disgusting

So, Biden should pick Obama as his Vice President. That would shake EVERYthing up. Talk about a game changer.
Start pushing on Joe Biden to sit for ONE interview and ask real questions. Amazing the democratic nominee gets a free pass from the media. Even  Chris Wallace asked trump hard questions, joes turn
Uh, Hickenlooper would be representing an Obama/Clinton/Biden state. Don't think it'd be awkward at all.
The biggest issue with this upcoming election is the Supreme Court. We need trump out to preserve our rights. A vote for Biden is the only option. I won‚Äôt debate this
I love how he‚Äôs using his mess as justification for saying electing biden will be what we get.
On an unrelated note Ryan, will you be changing the name from students for trump to students for Biden after November?
You still need to apologise to Biden.
Biden should name Obama his VP and then step down after taking office.
Carolyn Maloney has become a frequent target of primaries.  Collin Peterson is hanging on for dear life this cycle. Richard Neal has faced a couple primaries but remains to be seen whether he's really at risk of losing. DeFazio could very well go down in a Biden midterm.
WTH???  Is he losing it along with Biden now?
Let's keep this rolling past 1/20/21 so the incoming Biden Administration can undo this travesty.
Hard to fathom that anyone would vote for an obviously demented Joe Biden.  I know, I know ... he‚Äôs just the ‚Äúplaceholder‚Äù candidate for his to-be-named VP running mate who will, in short time, be President when Joe abdicates. But still ...
No, Biden‚Äôs election won't end the nightmare by

I won‚Äôt ‚ÄúTake a blade to my own conscience &amp; vomit up a vote‚Äù for Biden any more than Hillary
Ahahhahahhaa Biden isnt giving you weed either bud
Too true #Biden has a long career of pushing institutional racism of mass incarceration &amp; authoritarian legislation like the Patriot Act &amp; the brutal, global racism of war Trump corruption was in the private sector, Biden corruption was on taxpayers
1) You said the polls showed Trump was ahead, so you were just dead wrong there.  2) 2020 is not 2016, chump.
45 has done significantly more harm than good imo. i don‚Äôt think biden is perfect or even great, but between them i definitely align more with the direction he wants to take.
Sure, Hillary was an epic corrupt corporate warmonger who only serves donors, never us But #Biden has the cognitive decline factor that shows spectacular contempt for voters
Honestly think Trump is screwed in November. All the Biden campaign has to do is keep Joe from saying too much weird shit and he should win.

How were those quarterly numbers today?   Trump has taken us to an all-time low, but yeah, Joe Biden.
Name 1 positive thing Biden has done for Americans in 50 years
I support free market capitalist system, it has improved the lives of MORE PEOPLE than any other system in mankind.  Biden is full on Marxist/Socialist.  I dont want Gov to control everything, &amp; dictate how i live my life.  I want my individual liberty &amp; freedom! #Trump2020
I think she's voting biden ü§£
Love you Bernie, but no.  Biden has been dead quiet this entire time while you‚Äôre the only candidate actually saying anything. And he‚Äôs the one who ‚Äúwon‚Äù the Primary.  Trump is going to destroy Biden in November if we all assume he‚Äôs going to lose.   Please, go out and vote.
Lol blame Trump on everything. It‚Äôs okay the Democrats will lose again. Biden will lose a lot more than Hiliary. Democrat hates old white guy and they chose Biden that have been in politics for 50 years and all of a sudden he knows how to help Americans.....he was w/ Obama lol
Today was the day that Biden became POTUS.
Okay, but I don‚Äôt give af about ‚Äúemerging market traders‚Äù....I care about American traders (me) who trade first world market companies.  So no, screw Biden.
The best test for this is asking people if they think Joe Biden is a conservative. You get some interesting answers!
Lol it‚Äôs gonna be like 3 weeks into October with no election results certified DC is in absolute chaos and all the Biden cucks are gonna be like ‚Äúguys, guys, we have to do this peacefully‚Äù
Jesus, this Thursday is a shiz show. Can we start again?
I don't wanna hear that he doesn't support gay marriage because he does, unlike obama and biden.
Biden in April: Trump will try and delay the election. GOP/Trump fans: Biden is being hysterical. Trump today: We should delay the election.
Imagine getting tear gassed or worse for joe Biden.
I'll put my face shield on... and go vote for Joe Biden.
The economy is the only metric that middle-of-road voters trust Trump on more than Biden (probably because they only have a surface-level perception of his wealth). Losing the economy is losing the only legitimate card he has left to play.
Try it homer, any state that illegally delays the election will not be counted in the EC totals of those who obey the Constitution, Biden will either reach the threshold to win or he will not, but you will not, which will mean the house decides. Either way you lose.
The problem is that no one can understand what Biden saying
Gerry Mander is the only formidable candidate the  has.    #VoteBlue to outnumber their criminality.
Because Biden ran in 2016...........
Clueless old fool , loves the attention. He has been wrong over and over again. Americans need to wake up and realize this is about his support of China and the Biden campaign. Trying to keep Americans fearful .

Rashida Tlaib declines to back Biden amid tough House reelection fight: report

Trump is not making anything great. Trump‚Äôs economic success is because of everything Obama abs Biden did in their term. Anyone and I mean anyone who would have taken office after them would have had the same success with the economy. It‚Äôs not trump‚Äôs doing. Wake up

Joe  Biden, Jr., the record shows Pres. Trump is doing a far superior job than you and former Pres. Obama did handling The swine flu. Go back to sleep.
you may or may not be aware that when asked if asked to be your VP, Tammy Duckworth said: ‚ÄúIf Joe Biden told me his best chance at winning would be for me to go down to VA hospital and mop floors, that is what I would do.‚Äù
the VP choice is all yours VP Biden. However I hope you strongly consider Tammy Duckworth. A woman who has military experience, experience serving in the House and Senate. A woman who represents veterans, wounded veterans, and disabled Americans.
Opinion | If Biden wants to double down on a ‚Äòthird Obama term,‚Äô he should pick Susan Rice - The Washington Post
Odd that these aren't the types of discussions we're having. Both Trump and Biden have grounds which they could (and should) be immediately impeached over. This election is beyond in peril.
Joe Biden will be ‚Äî by far ‚Äî the most liberal Democratic candidate in history and I‚Äôm all here for it. I‚Äôm also totally here for literally any of the talked about candidates for VP. We have an embarrassment of riches.
Mr President the left by design wants to destroy small businesses because most side with you. Joey Biden doesn't care about these people.  Arrest these a-holes!
Now Biden publicly proposes the marketing of our children?! Why,.. That's what I've feared all along, but never imagined he'd have the cajones to admit!!....(üôÑsarcasm)
I‚Äôm more anti-Trump than I am anti-Biden. Maybe one year we can nominate someone that doesn‚Äôt make me hold my nose. Maybe a guy like Andrew Yang...
I have a Joe Biden joke, but I just forgot it.
He loves it when you call him a racist. It energizes his base with no positive effect on the Democrat voter given that Biden is a racist too and all of #BlackAmerica knows it.  The pattern of turning everything into racism causes legitimate claims to blend into the background.
Also hasn‚Äôt Biden said he wants to be single-term? So what‚Äôs the issue.
I‚Äôm gonna beat up joe biden
So I am clear, you are hyper focused on POTUS saying a fee rather then ‚Äúspend‚Äù? Are you equally critical when Biden has his numerous gaffes daily, or when he looses his thought process, or what city he is in? Come on.

I am one of those people living "the dream".  I HATE that you have done this.  This is beyond any hateful act you have ever done, which is saying a lot.  NO, I won't enjoy.  Just barely getting by waiting to get your sorry ass out so President Biden can reverse all your wrongs!!
Not excited about Biden?  Cool.  Just know that voting third party or not voting keeps tRump in office.  Surely you don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs exciting, right??
Who cares if she is ambitious? With Biden's age, she could very well assume the presidency any way.
There is a certain group of people who were mainly motivated to vote for the candidate who had the best chance of beating Trump. The clearest path for Democratic victory is in states (PA, MI, WI) that most people think love Joe Biden. So they voted for Joe Biden.
No one is afraid of Joe Biden. Try harder.
these Purge anti Biden ads are hilarious
No disagreements from me. He deserves a top position in Biden‚Äôs administration.
Boring Biden strikes again. If he picks Bass they both might literally put the media to sleep between now and e-day because there will be few hot takes to go on.
I wonder what percentage of those 20 are either out of cycle or clear of their primary and in a safe seat. My guess is 100%. Gotta stretch those fiscal hawk wings a little for Biden‚Äôs term. Don‚Äôt wanna come in cold
Interesting. So Biden should just pick whoever he thinks he would work with the best.

Biden may manifest whatever alpha traits he has in the worst possible manner, but they're still alpha. At least, far more so than mITT.
On point 1, THATs politics. She showed she is a tough, independent thinker. Why do we have problems with women who do that?   On point 2, you only have to see how many times Biden ran for president to see how hypocritical this "concern" is.

Ahead of Trump‚Äôs 16th visit to battleground Texas, yet another poll shows he trails Biden  keeping his immigration promises, namely ending birthright citizenship ,  would have been the only way to save TX.  Look no further than CA to see the end result.
Based on public platforms &amp; statements if Trump wins the election in the Fall its going to stay &amp; if Biden wins the election in the fall the government will put in something new. Voters (who are the consumers) can vet &amp; consider this fairly big issue and decide accordingly.

And for people who think ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just Trump being Trump‚Äù and doesn‚Äôt reflect the modern GOP, this is what the segregationists  published a month ago:
Biden‚Äôs housing plan is quite good. And the mandate to ‚Äúaffirmatively further fair housing‚Äù is from the original 1968 law that was signed after King‚Äôs assassination. We ignored it for 55 years and now are giving up on it after 3.
Oh, dear.  Our whole world is a considerably more dangerous place because this vain idiot is #POTUS.    Vote #Biden in 2020.
Given Biden's apparent aversion to doing anything that might lead to a negative ad it'll almost certainly NOT be somebody who ran in the primary or somebody with a long public record.  I think KLB is probably the best bet tbh.

Seen BIDEN speak. Oops
He was smoking everyone in the polls til harris/warren/pete &amp; co dropped out, and collectively endorsed sanders. I mean you couldn't have even blind to that right? Biden was a solid 3rd or 4th until they did that
Could say the same thing about Hillary, Biden, Obama, AOC, Pelosi, and the antifa and BLM mobs that go about destroying property and assaulting people.
Very interesting that  doesn't even attempt to make dog whistles like Nixon and Reagan and others did.  He comes flat out and tells "suburban housewives" to be afraid of Biden's pending "war on the suburbs."
"....and NBC News can project that Joe Biden has won the state of.... Alabama?!" ü§£
I agree, it's hard to trust anything coming from them. They're calling it a loan, so at least there's a chance it isn't a give away. To me it's the first sign that the Feds are taking this seriously.  6 months and he's not involved, up to Biden's people to make it work out right.
I agree that Biden exhibits some concerning speech issues &amp; seems to have deteriorated health over the last year or so. Dementia can set on quickly so debates prior to this cycle really don't interest me. Feel like we're voting for Trump or Bidens VP tbh
six more months until we have Trump again or Biden. Either way it is SIX MORE MONTHS OF THIS #COVID19
sorry, tweeting a lot today but it's now 6 months until we have Trump again or Biden either way, it's six more months of THIS... don't you feel some urgency???? #Covid_19
The optimism of a mind in cognitive decline is not something I can get behind  Running Biden shows utter contempt for voters
Have you heard Biden rejecting this? Nope. No democrat have said anything. In fact, they say they are "peaceful protesters"  I'm a Naturalized US citizen &amp; seeing this behavior breaks my heart. I'm not unamerican unlike some native American.
I mean he just continues to be bluntly racist. I don't want to hear Biden isn't your pick. Make sure you are registered and please vote this monster OUT.
I actually think they threatened legal action b/c the contracts to run as a democrat were insistent they all fall in line.  Hence tulsi endorsed biden
Biden said that he is 100% in agreement with  diverting the funding.
Trump can be a horrible choice without making Biden a good choice.
Or maybe he's not, I'm not sure why that is so important if it has significantly less mainstream support than either #Biden &amp; #Sanders  If #M4A isn't on the table, #Bismark isn't even in the room
I didn't know #Biden was pushing for #Bismarck..
This person is who? And some random person asks you a question you find offensive and suddenly they are Joe Biden supports? You sound bitter and divisive sort of like the person currently holding the highest office.

I don't understand how everyone can get behind Joe Biden. Does everyone not remember the last  16 years before trump? No jobs high taxes, consumer pricing through the roof. Then there was George Bush, who decided it was better
I just listened the quickie. That Joe Biden grant for minority owned businesses that small business oppurtunity fund sounds a lot like what Kamala Harris was advocating for on the debate stage.  It's looking like she'll get the VP nod.
Biden won't even legalize pot.
I think this is very telling.  If Biden came out and gave a cogent and thoughtful interview it would be a major coup for his campaign. It would go a long way to dispel the rumors of cognitive decline.  That Biden‚Äôs campaign won‚Äôt do this sends the opposite message.
Because it would make Biden a martyr &amp; anger Democrat voters.
Jack, why not interview of some dementia experts about Biden and publish their comments?
Is Biden blind?  Are they hiding vision issues?  Because you always see him with sunglasses inside and being led around like he cannot see anything.
First of all, I haven‚Äôt seen Biden‚Äôs plan for anything, much less Heathcare. Secondly, the market determines wages. Artificially increasing wages just leads to people being laid off, only the best of the best candidates being hired, and over-working employees.  Simple economics.
we need numbers great enough to transcend their creative and prolific malfeasance, and the more confident good but normally disengaged people become that their voices aren't required, the more likely they are to once again silence themselves. #VoteBiden
Creating false equivalencies between Biden and this despot as an excuse to vote Third Party/opt out/write in someone else‚Äîis an act of willful ignorance.   Stop it.
The funny part about this is that if Biden wins and Trump refuses to concede, who does he think is going to take to the streets and rip shit up on his behalf? Never-Trump Republicans? Panera Liberals from the suburbs? OK good luck.

I just love how the ad (and the version running in NC) is just Fox News people talking and then an out of context Biden voice interrupting them to say "Yes". It's so stupid and, sadly, likely effective
Except for when she didn‚Äôt even bring up #M4A while co-chairing the Biden-Bernie health care task force?? I mean-
No, no . . . I don‚Äôt see that. Now, Biden, absolutely.

I agree with this take. Being 'republican' as it relates to conservative political policy is considered, by many, to be a thing of the past now that populism runs rampant. The few clinging to that have nowhere to go (although they could do worse than super-centrist Biden).
They‚Äôre working w/media to make us think Biden is leading. Meanwhile, Biden is hosting speeches in community centers. I‚Äôve been in Co &amp; NC, I haven‚Äôt seen any Biden signs, not one but I have seen several Trump signs. Pay attention to details.
I haven‚Äôt been very enthused about voting for Biden, but this guy is really selling me on it idk.
Biden claims women of color 'have never had a fair shot to get ahead' in America    That's right Joe , because you spent your whole career keeping them down. hypocritical moron.

Joe Biden's had a decades long career in politics because he's not a moron. He understands what too many other campaigns didn't: most voters aren't on Twitter.
This is why he's leading the polls. Joe Biden is smart enough not to take stances that are out of step with the voters he needs to win the election.
This does not say she won't vote Biden.  It's a reflection on the history of party realignment at various points in history.  She even name drops so people can Google it.
You DO NOT have to vote for Biden
Biden must be drugged.  That‚Äôs the only explanation.
Don‚Äôt forget that Biden took questions from reporters for 30 minutes today while Trump has hardly faced any questions that weren‚Äôt screened in recent months without petulantly storming out of the room.
I will support Biden whomever he picks for VP. I love Harris, Rice, and Demings. Don't know as much about Bass.

Biden needs to start over with DHS and DOJ. Among other things...
Joe Biden, when he becomes President, needs to provide IMMEDIATE relief to everyone denied and who had their renewals reduced to one-year at no additional cost to the DACA recipient. As well as immediately enacting permanent solutions for Dreamers, and others, seeking relief.
So I dunno, I think it's OK to be honest that you're going to vote for Biden without pretending he'll be some kind of FDR/LBJ-like liberal hero. If he's pushed to the left by circumstance, great, but having studied his career pretty thoroughly, I'll believe it when I see it
After Democrats announced their terrible, non-platform and now Biden advocating for arresting people for their political ideology, count on me for never voting for Democrats again. BLM protesters have done more to improve lives in a few months than the Dems have in decades.
I've judged for myself. Biden is all there. Trump is not (he thinks it's an amazing feat to repeat 5 words in order).
Of course they will which will only push Biden further right.
Oh FFS. Grow up and quit whining!  Biden could pick a sweaty sock as his running mate and I would still vote for him!  So should anyone that cares about democracy!
It's not false equivalence to say a thing on the right is very VERY bad and a thing on the left is also bad. Some of those protesters did bad stuff. Also, Biden has attacked Trump dozens of times since June and criticized protesters twice. It's clear which one he thinks is worse.
I have a feeling anarchists would not have been reliable Joe Biden voters anyway.

New Biden ad about Trumps #Covid19 Failure is very Powerful.
I understand the frustration, trust me....but partly due to all the Bernie supporters that stayed home in November out of protest, the US has gone in the exact opposite direction they wanted.  At this point, Biden IS radical change from the past 4 years!
Piggy-backing off a culling process in a tweet by  earlier, which of the following do you PREDICT (not prefer) will be Biden's VP pick?   (if your pick is Elizabeth Warren, say so in comments).   If your choice is not one of these five, BLAME BETHANY'S FOLLOWERS.
Hahaha....you won‚Äôt get those from Biden. You keep on teeing it up for us. Obama and Clooney have alot riding on Trump not getting re-elected. No doubt the spy-in-chief and pedo actor are gonna tout that doofus.
Amazing that anyone would show such a complete ignorance of history. But fits right in with claims that Biden, Obama, etc. are socialists too. Anyone we don't like--&gt;socialist. Without a clue as to what a socialist really is.

Trump and Biden should have taken cue from musicians and stream speeches at drive ins across the country.  Would give local news across the country reason to cover it locally and get local grassroots involved.
Are you talking trash about Biden, with getting Trump out of office at stake. I wouldn't dis Bernie... Id support him.
Biden has not used any of the inflammatory kind of language that creates division and hatred among citizens of this country in the way that Trump has. He has not talked about people with guns being on his side.
Magats love to make up lies just like their cult leader. They also seem stuck way in the past, since current history of their own party is so horrific against minorities.
my theory is that they may have shared some of biden's script/speech with the press
NO $HIT!  You need a poll to tell you that!  What in Joe Biden is there to be ‚Äúenthusiastic‚Äù about?  He is the poster boy for establishment politics in America.
I hope Biden has some great  names that he's thinking of for attorney general. I'd love to see Adam Schiff be offered the job. I was just so impressed w/ him after the trial. He proved what a masterful prosecutor he still is &amp; LOL, he knows where all of Trump's dead bodies are!üòâ
The  polling average shows Biden up by 3 percentage points in North Carolina.  That's not an insurmountable lead.  In 2016, the average showed Clinton up by 3 as late as October 16. #ncpol
"We're leading in North Carolina,"  said in Morrisville.  He may have been referring to internal polls.  Still, the bulk of evidence shows Biden is leading a tight race. #ncpol
While I agree that mail-in's generally increase turnout, but,  if a place like NC gets rejection rates at anything like the current NJ primary (7.3%), it could lead to an overall swing of nearly 2% in the overall vote.  I don't know if Biden can afford that swing in NC.
my invincible strategy available for a price to the biden campaign is a captivating new persona i call JOE BOATIN'
I think this is wrong. The primary and the debates were way more about policy, particularly the other candidates. There was a fair amount of surprise they did NOT make Trump more of the focus. Biden did that early. The others did not. The primary voters made it about Trump
Biden's rebound from nearly last place (putting Bernie who was killing the entire first half in basketball terms) after Jim Clyburn eerie endorsement said enough.  It was the red scare flag.
You misspelled Biden.
Two things stood out to me. One is that Biden's foreign policy judgments were often poor. Second, Rice is POC descriptively, but has minimal history of substantively representing blacks' interests - well, in large part because she's never ran for office!

I mean both parties *are* bad. We have milquetoast right-of-center neoliberals who just decided to exclude medicare-for-all and to continue the war on drugs as part of their 2020 platform, and then we have the openly fascist Republicans. Joe Biden ain't gonna stop climate change.
Neither Joe Biden nor the Democratic Party machine represent America. They represent Big Pharma and the Police State.  #legalizemarijuana

I thought that this was likely.  But that was back in March.  Since then, almost every Dem has sold xe/xer soul to Biden. Which I can't imagine happening if they actually wanted to replace him.

Case in point: The Biden Victory Fund, who took $25,000 from Common Ground in June.  Biden says his VF won't take corporate PAC money, but thanks to PACs like Common Ground, he gets to have his corrupted cake and eat it too.  This is why we need sweeping campaign finance reform.
I mean he can't give 24 hour a day live interviews.  He stated his policy, I'd maybe give him at least 36 hours since he last spoke on live TV before saying he's hiding in Biden's basement
Biden is the reason why so many Black lives have been disenfranchised, imprisoned, and ruined by an archaic and racist law.
And it's only going to matter if (WHEN?) Biden gets inaugurated and can throw Barr (and everyone else) in prison.
You are correct. What millennials are going to vote for an old, white career politician like Biden?
My home county of Wake has received some attention from both of Trump and Pence but we're no swing county. Biden is certain to get at least 60% of the vote here.
That 96% GOP vote for Trump here in NC is gonna be a problem for Biden.  Yet, it also suggests whatever Trump is polling now in NC is close to his ceiling, there are few dissatisfied GOP voters left to "come home."  Tillis is toast (counter-point: look at all that room to grow!).
üëáüèªüëáüèªthis guy is on the same meds as Biden.   You are playing checkers on a chess board my friend.  üëáüèªüëáüèª
Then it's "fuck state rights".Your entire party is nothing but hypocrites.Which is why so many prominent Republicans have come out publicly against Trump &amp; for Biden. Enjoy it while it lasts...youve got 5 months left. Go look at a poll, why dontcha.ANY poll, Fox or otherwise.
Yap and they no it!! Blacks on different media has said blanks don‚Äôt believe biden but just traditional to vote Democrat!! SAD üò¢!! There‚Äôs lots of blacks breaking the trend!! But GOD loves you joey!! MAYBE he does??????? But you have to stop üõë all the lying ü§• joey!! SAD üò¢!!
They say kamala Harris who called joey biden a racist!! WOW üòØ!! What a joke !! His help is AOC writing up the Green Party üéâ agreement, If he wants sanders help joey will have to give everything free no one will have to work and illegals made legal with Medicare for all!!IDIOTS!
Biden campaign staff barred from trading stocks without approval ‚Äî and no TikTok
Yes, Democrats, keep believing that Biden will be the "most progressive President since FDR" as you're entire party shoots down Medicare For All, passes Trump's war budgets, renews the Patriot Act, and bails out corporations.
I say if Biden can go to the Capital for Lewis showing, then there is no reason he can‚Äôt show up to debate ...
just got an ad on youtube trying to demonize joe biden for agreeing to defund the police... and their scare tactic is a 911 call where "due to defunding of the police, our operators are on the line with other callers"
So disrespectable to a great man. This is your President, not mine. Wake up AMERICA, Vote for BIDEN and get this man out of the White House.
Like I said, it's dishonest advertising. First, if funds were taken from police, obviously 911 emergency services would not be cut. Second, Biden doesn't support defunding the police. Third, the Federal government does not control what local police departments do.
First presidential debate: Notre Dame withdraws from hosting due to coronavirus concerns    Notre Dame dropped out for Joe Biden , this is the plan to keep Biden from debating Trump. Claim it's not safe due to the virus - nonsense.
Founder  shows how radio stations can utilize lessons from a current political strategy to strengthen their images.  #politicalstrategy #Trump #Biden #radio
It may simply mean that more people vote for Biden than trump !
FiveThirtyEight does exactly that, and giving Biden a &lt;1 point edge in Texas and 8 in Minn.
Was reading about shadow-Trumpers. People who silently agree with Trump but don't admit it publicly, so they don't show up in polls and such, but they plan to vote for him in November.  I worry with all the numbers showing Biden in the lead, anti-Trump people won't bother voting.
The guy who is running ads saying nobody will answer when you call 911 if Biden is elected has some thoughts on dishonest advertising.
Biden's choice - Apple News Today
Biden may not been the ‚Äúchange maker‚Äù some on the left wanted (in Bernie it Warren), but surely you can see that he‚Äôs worlds better than 4 more years of Trump?!? One step at a time, people!!
In life, you usually don‚Äôt get exactly what you want. So you just take the best remaining option left on the table because it‚Äôs an upgrade from the alternative. Elections are a microcosm of this concept. Glad you‚Äôre like me and gonna suck it up and vote for Biden, dawg.
Trump has a secret military police, kids in cages, wants to destroy healthcare during a pandemic and has alienated our allies while praising dictators, and your line in the sand is Biden‚Äôs VP choice?
We‚Äôre all just posting here.  But the ‚Äúus/we‚Äù in ‚Äúat least he won‚Äôt throw us in vans and eventually camps‚Äù I suppose applies to what, white people?    Because Biden was definitely part of an administration that did do all of that.  You may of heard of it: The Obama Administration
John Biden will do that beginning with dismantling every fucking evil thing you‚Äôve done!
Are you talking about in the general election? In the primaries, joe Biden at least did receive a plurality of votes. Even if he wasn‚Äôt the first choice for most people, he still won fair and square and earned the democratic nominee. I think the primary and caucus process aren‚Äôt
Biden‚Äôs campaign in a nutshell:    - Orange man bad     - If you don‚Äôt vote for me, you ain‚Äôt black    -defund  the police (lawlessness)     - Everyone is a victim of society     - Raise taxes on the middle class     - China is never to blame     #Trump2020
No..it is not okay with me. I am not a Biden fan. I think he has used his position to manipulate foreign governments. I don't know why the Dems are supporting him as their candidate. He has a lot of baggage and I do believe he used his position to further his policy
Explain how else someone who had a 3% chance and was 10pts behind won.  Except there is now also zero enthusiasm for Biden. I‚Äôm sure there is excitement for him, but the majority doesn‚Äôt.
Why is Hogan given a platform on cable? He said yesterday on CNN "Both Trump and Biden are unpopular candidates". I can't take anyone seriously who puts the blame on "both sides" equally. Come on.
OMG!!  Yikes...  Kamala Debuts a New Face. Biden Reportedly Terrified in Basement.  via
Biden was VP for eight years and was a senator since he was 30.  You don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs faced scrutiny?  Lol
You're a joke and so is Biden. He won't bring any real change. He already said so months ago.
Joe Biden is a man of faith. Donald Trump is neither.
Your fear is based on how the left has reacted to Trump. What is going on has nothing to do with Trumps policies. And it won‚Äôt stop if Biden is elected.
If you vote for Biden, you are not a conservative.
Biden a decent human? He raked in billions from China. Democrats accept and promote the killing of millions of babies at all stages of gestation and now we know even a live child from a botched abortion. Democrats have no moral foundation upon which to stand.
You shouldn't be. The primary is OVER. So not endorsing Biden is endorsing tRump. That is way worse than "liking Farrakhan." tRump has done far more damage to each of us than a million Farrakhans every could. Brenda Jones is the sane, Dem choice.
Her maintaining her $175k/year salary is dependent on her describing Biden in these terms. She's certainly not an independent contractor for shit distribution.
*Biden is +7 in this poll. Apologies for the typo. Graphic is still accurate.
Polis would appoint someone though. Besides, Biden has pledged to pick a teacher.
If you know a black man who was incarcerated under federal law, there's a good chance Joe Biden hand wrote that law and is proud of it.
Joe Biden in search of a Vice President pick:
The centrists and establishment figures were so panicked about Sanders that they preemptively declared Biden the winner by forcing all the non-Sanders competitors to withdraw just after Super Tuesday.  There ain‚Äôt no love lost b/w the Bernie Bros and the establishment centrists.
Obama-Biden operatives had 'shocking' financial ties to Russia: Author
In a debate,  said to  our health care system is "cruel and dysfunctional."  The  voted today to keep cruel and dysfunctional in place.  Remind me again how that Biden / Sanders team is working out for America.  #MedicareForAll
If only the protesters had caravans &amp; were Mexican; you could hit the trifecta of Trump propaganda. So instead, you are now pitting Americans against one another &amp; against armed militia. Peaceful protests are protected under the 1st Amendment. They want change, Biden bring peace.
Biden leads in North Carolina as voters give Trump poor marks on virus, race relations ...
The only vaccine the Democrats will except will be if Biden wins the election then this virus will suddenly go away I‚Äôm sure.
Such a pathetic little man. He can't can his racism for 10 minutes to pay respects. #ThePresidentIsACrybaby #AmericaOrTrump¬†#Resist  Trump says he won‚Äôt go and pay respects to John Lewis at Capitol
0% chance we have the debates. They are already cooking up the excuse to blow it up. Biden‚Äôs camp has literally zero upside in a potential debate.   I do hope it happens though. Laughing at the pathetic situation we‚Äôre in between the two candidates is getting me by these days.
I mean easy fucking decision after Obama/Biden and now another 4 of Biden
This may be the best Biden ad yet.
Ingraham: Joe Biden's care package  via
Biden is a step backwards and the nation is rapidly falling apart at the seams. this isn‚Äôt progress
Yes. let's say Trump wins North Carolina by a point. Easy to see a scenario where Cunningham can outrun Biden by just a few points and win the race. Cooper's pretty much gonna win either way. Forest is quite obviously floundering.
He won't Why? Because he's in agreement with the anarchists. Democrats think we will vote for Biden so he can "fix" this mess. I wholeheartedly hope you win.  Please no more Sanctuary City for criminals. I'm a brown Hispanic female &amp; the thugs should be deported.
Of course he won't. He's a racist POS.
1) Politically, this is stupid.  2) Important reminder that candidate controls platform committee and we know where Biden stands on marijuana (he really is just an old white dude on this).
Joe Biden will not get my vote either as long as there isn't a strong conviction by the DNC and Joe Biden to see #MedicareForAll become a reality and it doesn't look there's a chance of that happening. So why vote for Biden again?
I think I can recover from COVID but I won‚Äôt survive Biden‚Äôs VP.
Then watch with unfettered glee as the election results roll in and Biden wins by a landslide
No,  you are incorrect...  1.  Wear a mask 2. Vote all democrats up and down      the ballot.   It is imperative all GOP lose every race out there. We need Biden,  60 blue senators and the House majority.  McConnel has proven he can stall anything and must be defeated!
If you actually read the article, her reasoning is sound. I agree that ppl are much more motivated by focusing on voting AGAINST Trump than voting FOR Biden. I use the same strategy when I talk to ppl. She's being smart and appealing to her voters the best way she can.
Where is Biden hiding?
Meanwhile Biden is on nearly every local channel in small, BS but sane interviews keeping to the script and sounding professional and not into human sacrifice so young drinkers can get their jollies off. The olds are getting pissed &amp; the GOP is understandably in their crosshairs
Love you man. I‚Äôm part of the ‚ÄúNot Me,US‚Äù movement. I must vote for Biden, but I‚Äôll be damned if I put his bumper sticker on my car. I‚Äôm in swing state NC, so I‚Äôll do my duty. ‚òÆÔ∏è ‚úåÔ∏è
You're right, at this time 4 years ago Clinton peeked at about +9 nationally right after the party's national convention.  Biden is at about +12 and hasn't even really lifted a finger yet.
I predict there won‚Äôt be any debates in which Biden has to face Trump alone on a stage. The Dems are too afraid of how Biden will come off. They‚Äôll press for some kind of social media crap where Biden can be propped up with teleprompters and handlers.
Bernie Sanders endorsed Biden. Throwing out wild accusations to attack Biden is right-wing troll tactics. Good bye
Bernie Sanders endorsed Biden. I guess he is wrong too. You are no ally to the left.
I have a Joe Biden joke, but bacon and German Shepherds are Cincinnati Reds!
Biden has said he will raise taxes and he absolutely will put liberal judges in place.   And if you are a lib, you sure aren‚Äôt normal.
This is your true motivation. Attack Biden no matter what. Guess who that helps. It is easy to see through your ruse.
This is pure disinformation. Biden's Tax plan is public. All you are doing is attacking the Democrats to help the Republicans.
Joe Biden is 77 years old. I wish him the best, obviously, but this feels like a scenario where you‚Äôd want to be comfortable with the VP choice as president. And I‚Äôve never heard of her.
North Carolina.  And Biden will win here just like Obama did in 2008.
Biden is a class act.   It is going to take every day between November 3 and inauguration day to get the smell of stupid out of the Oval Office drapes.
üôÑI hope she losesher primary. She wants Biden to win but will not endorse üôÑüôÑ. What kind of dumbasserory is that? This kind of bullshit is why Republicans are shit but still win.  üôÑüôÑüôÑ
Adult coloring is definitely a thing, and pretty common for stress-reduction, help with meditation, etc. I dabble myself. However, I will not be getting a Biden coloring book. üôÑ
If he is choosing somebody nobody has heard of that's a big mistake.  America needs to trust right now that wont build trust.
duh? Trump supporters are voting for Trump because they like him. Biden supporters are voting for Biden because he has a pulse and isn't Trump.
4 days left in July. Dems pushing for mail in voting. There is increased demand for absentee/mail in by some voters. Biden has not named VP. How will the states be able to get ballots printed and mailed out in time since number of prntg cos are limited?
Ok I guess now ‚Å¶ is following Facebook. Really?  That is my result when searching ‚ÄòJoe Biden VP‚Äô!?!
I said yes, but only because Trump is tanking himself hardcore. Biden isn‚Äôt winning; Trump is losing. You could run a paper bag against him (and they basically are). It‚Äôs important to note, however, that a lot can happen in 3-1/2 months, especially in 2020 ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
So you are for socialism?  You may not like Trump, but a vote for Biden is a vote for socialism, higher taxes, liberal judges. If that is what you want, you were never a conservative.
Joe Biden could still lose this election
Does Biden even know what month it is?
As will Biden this election. It‚Äôs sure is a great thing NY and LA don‚Äôt determine our election.
not their first choice. Joe Biden wasn‚Äôt even one of my top 3 choices for example, but I still sucked it up and will vote for him come November. It‚Äôs an easy choice for me.
That‚Äôs why people need to actually vote blue. There are more democrats than republicans, but democrats have lower voter turnout and in presidential elections, too many vote third party or vote down ballot. People gotta suck it up and vote for guys like joe Biden, even if it‚Äôs
Here we go. I bet 1000 bucks that  will stay in his basement &amp; refuse to debate  If #LameStreamMedia continues to let #LowIQJoe not answer any questions, &amp; no debates..does that seem fair to ANYONE? it‚Äôs nuts. Destroy  24/7, pretend Biden is ghost
Narrator: these people still won't support Biden in the general. They're just unwilling to face the fallout from saying it out loud.
should refuse to debate Trump until he releases his taxes. Debates are norms, not requirements just like releasingbyiur taxes as a candidate. Biden is in a position to hold Trump accountable for this particular violation of norms and he should do so
There is ONE way. The primary is OVER.  If you don't vote for Biden, you're voting for four more yrs of tRump. If you,  as a politician, refuse to endorse a candidate after a primary, you're endorsing his opponent. This is the reality. Now I'm off to block your dumb as.
Joe Biden may be the first President ever elected because he avoided public appearances or comments.  If he could just keep his mouth shut!

Well..there is his abominable response to COVID19, he fucked up a fully functioning economy he INHERITED from Obama and Biden by cutting taxes to the wealthy and not using a booming economy for infrastructure or ANYTHING...
Biden has been a conservative for 40 years, u have seen how they run the Senate. U tell me. Is it easier 2 get a conservative who knows that 2050 is 20 years 2 late 2 save this planet, or would u rather flip the Senate? Remember 70% of Congress is conservative, too.
Yes.  Trump leads a cult.  Of course they are enthusiastic for their Dear Leader.  Biden doesn't lead a cult.  But WAY more people will vote for him because he is not a wannabe dictator cult leader.
It is so discouraging!! Just read an article about two tools wearing swastika masks in Walmart saying Biden would bring socialism...actually the opposite of fascism on the political spectrum...but whatever...and the comments from the right wingers were stunning.
And here it begins.. Biden will never debate POTUS ... He will get laughed off the stage...
Collin Peterson pretty enthusiasticly endorsed Biden and his district went for Trump by 30%. Rashida Tlaib declining to do so doesn't make much sense.
The interesting thing to me is this isn't about political affiliation. Voters only ask for competency &amp; leadership during crisis. DeSantis is a GOP Gov of a FL, but compare his approval to DeWine the GOP governor of Ohio. 79%...  AND 81% w/ Democrats.
Here‚Äôs how Biden and Trump are faring in the swing state.
Reason 145 why I voted for Biden.
Every time I see one of these stories I think about how important it is to vote for Joe Biden this November. That's the only way to end this.
OK, as long as you took the time and educated yourself so in your case it‚Äôs Joe Biden, at least we both know where we stand, best of luck out there Michelle.
Yes they appear to be dumb enough to vote for Biden
Were these just anti-McCain voters?? Like, they just had a frothing hatred towards McCain for some reason? That makes about as much sense as being an Obama voter and hating Biden this much.
very disappointed Biden put that fossil on the VP search committee, what a joke
Yeah because for Biden is less than 10 attendees.
Fuji Fill-um? Huh? I can understand one slip up, but this is every time he tries to say "film".  don't talk crap about Biden's mental acuity. You can't even get the word FILM right. #TrumpIsUnwell #FILLUM #TrumpVirusCatastrophe
Felt strong disturbance in the farce, then realized Pres. Trump had landed 5 miles away at RDU.   On other hand, gotta say, this is how Prez candidates behave: they go to states they need to win.   I'm hoping Biden breaks precedent and visits Wisconsin...

Make it a landslide for Biden and VOTE
Bernie sanders was not kidding when he said he wanted a political revolution and now Joe Biden is in the same camp. Revolution means overthrowing our constitution. It makes sense why they are beginning unconstitutional sieges on federal buildings.

Yes ANARCHISM and CAMPAIGN STRATEGY but actually this is what to expect if the liberal-SOCIALIST (Joey biden) wins , AMERICA LOSES!Can anyone win anything by calling names ,PROPAGANDA for CAMPAIGN STRATEGY?? biden says he‚Äôs going to do things but guess what,Trump‚Äôs IDEA‚ÄôS FIRST!!
hello Mr. Biden.  so the eight years you were VP under President Obama, ‚Äúwomen - particularly women of color - have never had a fair shot to get ahead?‚Äù  good to know  Why wasn‚Äôt this undoubtedly awesome plan used then?
Rather than send in Blackwater goons, Biden would just straight up send the National Guard to break up the protests.
It‚Äôs a protest vote that could definitely hurt Biden and let trump get re-elected. It cost Hillary Clinton in 2016. Please people, suck it up and vote for Biden because he‚Äôs our only shot at precluding trump being in the White House for 4 years. Trump is the worst president ever.
This is insane logic. Biden is center-right on some issues, therefore, Biden is the same as Trump. This is how Trump wins.
Just now, an America First ad followed by a Trump ad both exploiting Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúyes, absolutely‚Äù quote about defunding the police.  Lots of money being spent here in NC.  Oh yesh, there was an anti-Tillis ad before those.

My God if you aren‚Äôt correct about North Carolina! Every commercial break is a Trump, Biden, Tillis or Cunningham ad. I am about sick of watching TV because of it.
Best strategy for Biden and Dems would be to keep as low a profile as possible. Do not associate Hillary with Biden!  Let Trump make mistakes, no ones hurts Trump more than himself.

I‚Äôm in for anything I can do to help Biden be our next president, so let me know ‚Äî time is limited with all the kiddos at home, but I want to do what I can.
Trump having trouble attacking a white, male, moderate so he is desperately trying to tie Biden to women and people of color, so he can ramp up the racism and sexism -- its the only song he knows.
Biden camp needs to widen this margin to Trounce Trump. No squeaky wins, need to be landslides.  Cunningham over Tillis is FABULOUS!!! Praying and working here in NC so that these numbers hold and he pulls out the win!
I think Trump would love to debate. It‚Äôs the last lever he has left to pull since his Covid response has been so poor. He wants to insult Biden and do his debate schtick. I can‚Äôt say it probably wouldn‚Äôt help him some
You must be talking about biden
THESE RIOTS STARTED UNDER OBAMA AND BIDEN IN 2009. THEY DID NOTHING THEN. WHY WOULD WE EXPECT BIDEN TO DO ANYTHING NOW???

Joe Biden cannot feel pain
You are running against both Biden and COVID-19. No way to overcome both.
If Democrats flip the Senate, it's simply impossible that a Biden SCOTUS nominee gets 60 votes. The Republicans who would confirm a Dem SCOTUS nominee are almost all gone. Alexander? retiring. Snowe? Long retired. Graham? lol
Why won‚Äôt Biden bd interviewed.
Neither Biden nor Trump "deserve" a single vote, simply because they are part of the duopoly.  If they can't _convince_ me to vote for them, I'd cast no vote rather than vote for someone with whom I disagree.
Joe Biden only reads Jacobin
BIDEN would be a Damn FOOL if He Don't pick ... KAMALA HARRIS as the VP ........ that's FACT üí™üëÄü§úü§õ
Twitter fam can you guys help me find the video about Biden - its short and the major premise is the shocking revelation at the end that "he's a democrat."  I can't find it anywhere and wanted to show someone! Can even remember who did it... #biden2020 #warrendemocrats help!!!
Biden is responsible for what every democrat in America says?
Biden is a pedophile some of his supporters love childrenü§Æ

Yes, Ted. Joe Biden is carefully monitoring the social media accounts of every single Democratic candidate across the country. Get a grip.
Only overconfidence can defeat Biden now.
You are Putin's puppet and I can't believe anyone would vote for you.  How did we manage to have 25% of the world's deaths from COVID-19 when we only have 4% of the world's population?   This goes way beyond incompetence.  Biden and peaceful protesters are not the "radical left"
Truth, Biden's ads have been on point so far which is encouraging. I'm reserving judgment until they debate, I want Biden to utterly eviscerate Trump on national TV
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Yes, him. That was Biden quoting a memo from a racist while working on passing the Voting Rights Act. Attributing that to Biden is a deliberate distortion, but you already know that.
The first part of my webinar was cutoff. Is Joe Biden going to speak on the webinar?
Pretty annoying whenever we say ‚ÄúTr*mp‚Äôs America‚Äù, or ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs America‚Äù... these guys/gals are our employees. This is Our America. Saying that outloud, I think it helps too to not deflect blame by calling it someone else‚Äôs. We are here folks.
Biden leads Trump by 8 points, holds big advantage among undecided voters: poll
Tbh I'm not 100% confident Biden is going to have a strong response to Trump's attacks when his entire campaign strategy is predicated around tiptoeing around white suburban "moderates"' delicate feelings
Biden should be the first candidate
One of the funniest thing to me about the recent Trump ad that says Biden is going to defund the police is that it probably helps Biden with his party and easily debunked as being false. Even if it is, calling 911 and having someone come would not be impacted. Just dumb patrols
I see clearly. Blind is not seeing that Trump is a symptom of a far greater disease that you perpetuate with cult-like savior speak.   You are not even enthusiastic about Biden. You are simply repeating what is sold to you by the  and corporate MSM to keep the status quo.
‚ÄúThis would be Joe Biden‚Äôs America‚Äù he says in reference to a video of what is happening right now in Trump‚Äôs America
Who is tweeting in behalf of Biden? Biden isn't capable anymore.
Which is why it is imperative that we elect Biden and turn the senate blue.
Actually there's a huge difference between Biden and Trump but go ahead, gin up the apathy.
Never expected such a resounding endorsement of Biden from bowtie boy.
Excellent analysis. And if Biden loses (and he can because it is a 50 / 50 contest), it is because the  got behind a weaker candidate than HRC (who lost) just to stop any of the real and meaningful changes proposed by
I didn't agree with some of the things she did as District Attorney in SF, but her commitment to social justice is deep, and she would bring some qualities lacking in Biden. Val Demmings would also make a great VP. I admire Abrams, Lance-Bottoms, Bass, and Rice
When a moral person makes mistakes, and in Biden's case grave errors and repeated lies, they acknowledge them as mistakes, errors, and lies, apologize if necessary, and repent.  Have yet to see any of that from Joe.
Replacing Trump with Biden is replacing a liar with a liar. Replacing Trump with Biden is replacing failure with failure.  Ted Rall lays out a 100% factual case about   here.
Ahh, so that‚Äôs what the Biden signs look like. I Had NOT see one before.
Replacing Trump with Biden is replacing a liar with a liar.  Replacing Trump with Biden is replacing failure with failure.   It is that simple.
We're desperate for trump to lose too  Boris Johnson's government is privately 'desperate' for Trump to lose the election to Joe Biden
Now do Obama and Biden.

JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
is right.  Trump's gutted the Republican Party. He's a parasite, saw weakness, stepped in &amp; capitalized on it. The Lincoln Project peeps need a serious place at the table, these are the kind of GOP voices, talent and intellect Biden could use moving forward.
Never mind. I'm not doing this. It's ridiculous. I'm more concerned about people dropping dead, 1000 per day and will NEVER agree that Joe Biden is as bad.  Apparently, your life is going much better than mine, under Trump, so do whatever you're gonna do.
Ambush Biden on Fifth Avenue and shoot him, maybe? Maybe not even that.
Trump has kept his base strong and has actually grown it recently from what I‚Äôm hearing.  Maybe it‚Äôs credit to Trump?  Or maybe it‚Äôs credit to the left running Joe Biden who is clearly having some health trouble...which is really sad to see.
You see?  Normal Americans are not socialists or communists.  Biden is going to lose in November and I think you all know it
I don‚Äôt think Trump will have much of a problem beating Biden in November.

I don't think Biden would sell us out for a dollar. Simple.
Senator Graham, by not going after Joe Biden or Obama,  you are selling the American people short. They organized the spying.
Biden is hiding and should be forced to make a statement about the Coveffe hoax to manufacture Chinese toilets we have to flush 20 times. Obama spied on the Russians. Investigate!
Obama/Biden attempted to close prisons for profit... Trump/Sessions kept it in place

He is right to say that I am not enthusiastic about Biden. But I am enthusiastic about decency. I‚Äôm enthusiastic about science. I‚Äôm enthusiastic about inclusion. I‚Äôm enthusiastic about hope and love. And so best believe that I will be enthusiastic to vote for Biden.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.  Keep this tweet rolling!
Lol. He‚Äôs up double digits. These people can‚Äôt help but to perpetually own themselves. If this is true, and Biden is in fact just hanging out in his basement eating bonbons or whatever and he‚Äôs kicking Trumps ass, then what does that say about Trump?
This is good, informative work.  Thank you Barry.  The only thing I would pick at ... I seriously doubt Biden could win SC in the decisive Biden scenario.  Uneducated, white racists dominate SC.
Do you seriously think Biden is more dangerous than Trump? I don't like the Dems, but this is chaos. Unmarked vans don't worry you, just a little? I really want to know. Don't you think it's better, at this point, to have someone who will AT LEAST listen to scientists?

Most unfortunate as she was in many respects a much better candidate.
Think of Joe Biden as a bad drug. He might make you feel good for a while but he's doing irreparably damage to your body without you knowing.
I want Biden to have the best Cabinet possible. And I think  is needed in whatever role she can have the biggest impact. We need her brilliance and experience.
Obama / Biden escalated Afghanistan, started Syria/Libya/Yemen (murdered an American by drone), and never left Iraq as promised. See Edward Snowden June 2013  Just told Wall Street donors not to worry, "nothing will change"  Rationalizing even the death of one person is sad.

It is orchestrated chaos by democrats.  As for a Florida at least it isn‚Äôt because their leaders sent Covid patients to elder care facilities. It‚Äôs a disease that China allowed to spread. When Trump stopped flights from China did you, like Biden, call it xenophobic?

Yes history also tells us how Democrats tried everything to stop republicans from giving rights to the black population!! President Trump has done great things for all Americans, one America, one people is how Trump is bringing our GREAT üëç COUNTRY Together!!BIDEN =FAILURES, SAD!
Yes , they are so full of it, especially when that FAILURE Joey biden says he will take their chains off and if they don‚Äôt vote for him , their not black?? What??  he said hussein obama is neat and articulate for a black man!! Worst of all, buddies with Robert Bird(Senator &amp;KKK)!
Lies what can we expect from a man who accepts the the murder of innocent babies in mother's women's. Abortion is an abomination mr.  Biden.  start caring for the unborn and then you can lecture people. You don't care for covid patients. Life means nothing to you
Good idea for the Failures of the hussein obama,hillary clinton and joey biden administration!! 1 example is the FAILURE of the MURDERS of GREAT AMERICANS in BENGAZI !!2 battle ships off the coast!! AMBASSADOR Stevens emailed 100‚Äôs of times (HELP)NO HELP ever came !! DISGUSTING !

The Trump Campaign Is Losing Its Mind Over Polls Showing A Biden Blue Wave
Amazing they picked him.  Very brazen by dnc.  But now requires full Trump scare b/c Biden is not inspiring.  Give me somebody like Sinema or Gabbard and now we‚Äôre talking, just imo.
MSNBC says Trump should put together a phony dossier and start spying on the Biden campaign, fair is fair right.
Think Biden‚Äôs priority should be healing the Republic, liberating and uniting caged children, rebuilding trust w/allies and reinstating all of regs Trump did away with.
The only thing better than Biden winning Texas big is picking up all 38 of its  electoral votes with a razor thin margin of victory. That may persuade some Republicans to support a popular vote.
Didn't love that moment nor his giant blind spot about patriarchy but otoh now I have to vote for Biden so I'm not really that mad at Yang
Biden is so horrible leftists have to support this violence to hope it generates an edge against Trump at any price b/c otherwise the spotlight is on DNC which picked an old white mentally deficient hack - everything they said they didn‚Äôt want, lol.  This is all they have!
Leftists/progs are into this b/c anti-Trump. If they had someone w 1/100 the prospects Obama showed in 08 they‚Äôd be focused on that.  Instead they picked old white basement Biden &amp; there is a lot in that they need to ignore - so this is all they have.
Stop saying ‚ÄúBiden can‚Äôt finish a sentence‚Äù like it‚Äôs an insult. It could be a medical condition. Just because he has a bit of trouble does not mean he can‚Äôt run this country better than a lot of presidents. So if you‚Äôre that desperate do insults idk what to say.  #Biden2020
#CrookedTrump ‚Äúloves‚Äù breaking the law and emoluments. He told us he‚Äôd ‚Äútake the data,‚Äù ask for dirt on Biden, wanted the G8 at his Florida resort, makes taxpayers pay for the Secret Service stays at Mir-A-Lago, golf carts, etc We need Biden in and to  #ArrestTrump
And, the number of black on black murders just continue to explodes and few Dem leaders show any interest. We know Obama and Biden accomplished no changes during their 8 years. While Trump has made major improvements in unemployment and Federal sentencing reforms
It's a shame, Biden may end up being right with his accidental gaff of 2 million deaths, if #IMPOTUS continues to pretend he knows what the eff he's doing instead of letting the grownups do the job!
Well, he certainly can't NOT debate.  They'd cling to that so hard.  1 debate, rest up biden. It should be ok.
GOP criminality means that we are always far behind.  Voter suppression, gerrymandering, pushback against mail-in and absentee voting, the elimination of polling sites, and Russian cyber-shenanigans‚Äîall remove any possibility of a level playing field.
I understand Trump is a symptom of a far greater disease afflicting America.   What's your favorite Biden fail?  Hugging Segregationists Racist Crime Bill Iraq War Illegal and Endless Wars Wiretapping Americans Wall Street screwing Main Street 68,000 who die under PPACA  ?????
Everyone should support Joe Biden loudly and proudly! Don‚Äôt be wishy-washy. Tell everyone you know you support Joe Biden. The third party candidate last time was a Russian stooge. Sickening. Support Joe!
LOL at thinking Hillary was a much better candidate. This shows you have zero idea what you are talking about. Hillary was much more scandal-ridden and her favorability ratings were far worse than Biden. Her standing in polling against Trump also wasn‚Äôt as strong as Biden‚Äôs is.Y‚Äôall are a bunch of damn haters.  How much did Hunter Biden make in his Daddy‚Äôs illegal arrangement with a freaking UKRAINE oil company?  How much did the Clintons launder through their foundation?  At least they made their money on the USA.  Hypocrites!!!!
I think the VP should be Duckworth. She can hit Trump hard on his failure to protect our troops from Russian bounties ‚Äî or even address it. While Biden goes after them on everything else at home.  I want Harris for AG. And I want her to go after Kushner, Miller, and the lot.
Clinton, Obama and Biden all have credibility problems.  A record of false promises and lies.  If you would like to continue with being lied too, your choice is easy.
I‚Äôm going to vote for Biden because I‚Äôm not under the illusion any more that a man can win the 2020 election without also having been an abuser.   I detest Biden but at this point I‚Äôm choosing him because I think he will cause less deaths. Not less sexual assault but less dying.
Lol- more people there than in Biden‚Äôs basement ü§£üòÇ
I can‚Äôt believe the Biden camp is seriously considering her.  They must‚Äôve known this before it got out.  Plenty of people would inflate the level of interest to make Biden look bad.   My money is still on Kamala Harris.
Yeah‚Ä¶  I think I‚Äôm in the Susan Rice camp. She can almost immediately mend ties overseas. Trump and his cronies will scream Benghazi, but if you believe in that narrative, you weren‚Äôt voting for Biden anyway.
Oh good lord.  I hope Biden is not foolish enough to pick this person -plays right into trumps hands. üôÑüôÑ kamala is the choice
Trump wanted Bernie so bad in the general that the new campaign strategy is literally to pretend Biden is Bernie. He knows he‚Äôll lose to a moderate, that‚Äôs why he wants to paint him as an extremist, which is just delusional.
I agree but some people want to try to brand it as a negative because they don‚Äôt want her to be Biden‚Äôs VP pick.That‚Äôs all it is.
It‚Äôs a stupid claim to try and brand her as someone who would not be focused on the now if she was VP in a Biden presidency and looking ahead to possibly get the big job someday. Someone - especially a woman - being labeled as being ‚Äútoo ambitious‚Äù as a slight is ridiculous.
Oh we will know. A landslide victory for Joe Biden. How will #CrybabyTrump handle that?
The fact that Ed Rendell has successfully weasled himself back into relevancy for at least the next six months is itself the most damning argument against ‚ÄúJoe Biden is progressive now, really, he is, stop laughing‚Äù
Did everyone unfamiliar with the process just decide they are experts qualified to critique it?  When there is nothing at all different or unusual, other than Biden narrowing it to women, which he did 4 months ago?  Welcome to the game, Noah!
We are Draining the Russian Swap in the White House alright. You will be gone in January 2021.                                   Polls: Trump 39 - Biden 59
Seriously?   Hey other old white dudes... Biden‚Äôs successor will not be one of us. Deal with it, ok?
Biden literally said he sees himself as a bridge‚Äîhe KNOWS that the VP can and should be a part of the bridge by being someone who can and should run for President in 2024 or 2028. This particular loyalty litmus test reeks of misogynoir AND trumpism
This is perhaps the most misogynoir-esque part of it: demanding loyalty by promising not to run? VPs have almost always run, including Biden, and weren‚Äôt considered disloyal for that ambition. Those Veeps were all white guys &amp; here we are talking about Black women. Just üòí
Remember she called Joe Biden a racist.  now she want to be his number üí©
The one candidate who has been most effective at quelling the rise of progressivism of the left hasn‚Äôt been anyone on the right. It has been Biden.
The good news, GOP controls legislatures in 30 states, so only blue states would mandate mail-in voting &amp; Biden will win those anyway.
‚ÄúShe‚Äôll *only* focus on becoming president if she becomes VP‚Äù - how do you think administrations work exactly? This isn‚Äôt Richard III, Macbeth, or anything else from Shakespeare where she‚Äôs been plotting to murder Biden via soliloquys and talking to ghosts this whole time.
She has superb legislative skills, but that‚Äôs not especially useful for someone like Biden. Hire to your weaknesses.
Kampala Harris is a perfomative ally just like Biden. So it makes sense.
If Dems seriously think they can win the Presidency this year, would they still be hanging on to Biden? Or are they waiting for the VP pick &amp; convention, then dump him? Do they really think Kamala Harris will fire up voters? She couldn't even win 1 delegate.
Gee, I am guessing Fox News will never bother to apologize to Vice President Biden for his now proven 100% CORRECT statement. #FOXNEWSLIES #DumpTrump2020 #PutinsPuppet #TraitorTrump #VoteBlue

Joe Biden's campaign strategy really is "Be quiet, and let Trump talk himself into a corner"
what‚Äôs the point of voting for the people who made Trumpism possible? they are going to make actual fascism happen if Biden gets back in office. people are so conned out of just supporting politicians they agree with. pathetic.
Can‚Äôt wait to see y‚Äôall meet President Biden next April #dukembb
Same victim BS Trump GOP uses.  Obama / Biden failed America and HRC lost running on that failed War and Wall Street status quo.
neither am I. *quietly holds her Biden flag*
I've seen the same Biden ad 4 times this morning.  It's from a PAC and it's a really good ad.  His ads always are upbeat unlike the buffoon's who uses scary tactics.
Michigan's 11th District is located in the suburbs outside Detroit. Democrat  flipped this seat in 2018 by a pretty decent margin and it seems quite likely to vote for Biden. This is a district where Dems did better in 2018 than Gary Peters did in 2014.
Joe Biden, Jr ... I am glad you qualified that ...‚Äùwhen I‚Äôm president‚Äù. Not to worry!
Joe Biden is a witch. He steals conservative babies at night and gives them to Bernie and during the day he steals progressive babies and feeds them to the Lincoln Project.
I‚Äôm 32 and someone in their early 20s feels like a child.
I don't follow. Only in 2008 did a D crack 10% margin in the last 5 prez elections. Gophers consistently blue, but not by large margins. Biden +10 is a pretty damn big lead.  Do you mean you think he needs to be up 15 to account for shenanigans?
After the last Republican Administration created the Great Recession, Obama and Biden came in and led the country‚Äôs recovery.

Correct. Two corrupt parties owned by Wall Street. Biden is Blue Trump w/o the narcissistic sociopathy of Trump.

"More Americans think that Democrat Joe Biden will likely win in November (41%) rather than President Trump (37%). This is in line with findings last month (Biden 42%, Trump 38%)."  Older &amp; diff surveys showed people thought Trump was more likely to win.
Expect the info to come out as part of October surprise on Biden.
No one in NC thinks Biden wins NC. I can't get one Democrat to take even a $10 bet he beats Trump in NC. Bill Clinton lost NC twice. Hillary once. Obama lost NC in 2012. Barely beat weak McCain by 14,000 in 2008. Biden ain't any of them. He loses NC big
I think scripture elevates  character over policy differences, the character, conduct and competency of Biden is much preferred over Trump. Christians can work for issues they care about with democrats but should never say someone like Trump represents us.
First, you said Biden wasn't racist.  Second, Trump is a moron that doesn't deserve the office.  Third, Trump's base is not energized by racism. They are energized by the rabid, constant criticism of racism. They see him treated like they are treated and they identify with him.
Biden 110%. Clowns scare me.
Pupper Joe Biden acts like he's just napping on my book, and he'd never drag it outside, rip the dust jacket off, and chew on the hardcover...but he's done that at least 15 times.  I need to be better about putting my books away. Great read by  highly recommend.
I would like to know them NOW! Bye don!!! Biden!
Oh no! Is Scientific Realm‚Äôs social media intern tweeting without checking with ANYONE who was paying attention from 2008-2016?! Maybe you should do a quick search of Standing Rock or the Southern Border &amp; see how ‚Äúprotests‚Äù were handled by Biden‚Äôs last WH administration?
Is Biden copping a feel in that picture?
That doesn't matter once Biden is in
You have got to be out of your mind! Trump is having his storm troopers beat up moms in Portland. Trump's failure of leadership has allowed the Coronavirus to rapidly spread across America. Our GDP dropped 32% because of Trump's failures. Biden will stop the bleeding Trump caused

I‚Äôm an atheist but at times I utter ‚ÄúThank God‚Äù, mostly out of habit.  I‚Äôd vote for a lamp post over Trump, but not too thrilled Biden once considered naming a F- Republican as his VP. Both Obama and Biden favor neoliberal policies.

Look at 2016 my man. The average of polls was off by 1.2 points from the final result. If that were the case today, Biden would win the popular vote by 7.1 points. No way Trump eeks out an electoral college win with that margin.

I can‚Äôt stand Hollywood.  I just finished the Epstein doc on Netflix.  It TRIED to tie Trump to Epstein (failing miserably), and did not include a SINGLE GD interview or mention of the accuser who says Epstein &amp; Maxwell sold her to John McCain and Joe Biden through a DC madam...
I‚Äôm starting to have a hard time telling the difference between real Joe Biden tweets and parody Joe Biden tweets.
Like I said. Keep believing Biden's 8-point lead isn't real. You probably don't even need to vote since Trump will win so easily.
Biden for President!!!!!
If Kansas is close at the presidential level, that suggests Biden is doing extremely well with rural white voters and headed towards an electoral landslide. KS is only slightly more educated than the US as a whole. The real secret to Laura Kelly's win was rural voters.
Biden VP Pick Odds: Kamala Harris Odds Surge To Best Ever
Yes, keep thinking Biden's 8-point lead in the polls is wrong.
Would say it's quite unlikely Republicans get locked out and she would have zero shot at defeating him. One of those districts that could be competitive in a Biden midterm if there's no incumbent.
Kamala Harris most likely being Biden VP pick has me fucking depressed as shit rn
I think that pres number is too rosy. Walz won his district by about 3% in 2018. For Biden to win MN-1, he'd probably have to win statewide by at least 15 points and I don't see that as realistic. 10? I can see that. 15? Eh.
It's soothing to listen to you President Biden. More of us than trumpets. I believe this election will really be a blue wave.....‚úå

I'm a huge  fan already but if his voting rights group pays off Florida felons restitution so they can vote and that tips Florida Biden's way which then flips the national election Biden's way, I think that makes him the GOAT in my book.

It's all up to us if we want to allow Trump to "cancel" or "postpone" the election, or let him try to contest the results. When Biden wins an overwhelming victory on election night, which will be held on Tuesday, November 3rd, and then he will be inaugurated in January, period.
So Pelosi will be president until Biden gets it
That long sigh after saying he's voting for Biden...that's where I am too. I dont know if the Republican party has come completely unmoored or I'm just seeing what has always been there just under the surface, but the last 4 years have been insanely disappointing to this former R
Intel Dems press Nunes for details on anti-Biden package from Ukrainian official  The former chairman‚Äôs office has declined requests to respond to inquiries about whether he ever received the package or learned of its contents.
Right but the point is Biden wouldn‚Äôt have acted at all.  Lol
Steven Calabresi will vote for Donald Trump in November. He will release a statement regarding some innocuous, dem boiler plate thing Biden says as a reason , that despite Trumps personal abhorrence, the radical agenda of Biden is just too dangerous for the nation to endure.
I just had a truly disheartening thought: we are so focused on electing Biden we have convinced ourselves that he will right this ship and we can go back to our normal basic disinterest of government. What if ü§° has disrupted things so badly we can‚Äôt get back there?!
I do not want to vote for Trump or Biden... need another option. #vote
Please vote for Joe Biden in November so we can figure out what the next best steps are for this country. Because another four years of Trump will be when the real nightmare begins.
You don‚Äôt like those people‚Äôs politics. How are those people under minding our democracy?  And how is the Joe Biden nomination anything like the trump nomination? One a former VP, former longtime senator; they other a reality TV show host.
why did you lie to the American people again. Voter suppression is a hallmark of the democratic party.  It is time to bring you to justice and lock you up in prison along with Clinton, Biden,
Hillary was leading by 3.3 points in the 2016 polls. Biden is up by 8.3.
Yeah there is no doubt in my mind, I'm all in for Biden. Which I recognize is stupid because he's a worse version of HC. I'm an idiot, but at least I'm trying to learn.
Biden should keep doing what he's doing because he's leading by over 8 points.
That's what I just said. Some polls are double digits. The average of all polls right now is Biden +8.3.
Lol patriot. The Wall Street patriot? The GM &amp; Ford Patriot? Unforgiving outrage that has gave way to what... a Netflix deal? Hearts are really going to melt when Biden doesn‚Äôt give us shit but lights some fireworks out of his ass ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°

Keep telling yourself that.  2016 Polls: Clinton +3.3 2020 Polls: Biden +8.6
Some polls are double digits. The average is Biden +8.3.
Lmao, she‚Äôs gonna tank Biden‚Äôs chances at winning. Swing voters don‚Äôt want that race hustler.
There's a lot to unwind. I suspect Biden will do it quickly and have a transition team in place unlike Trump in 16.  It's hard to fathom how much damage they *didn't* cause due to their ineptitude.
With  appearing at the  convention, imagine if GWB also jumped in, and then endorsed Biden. I'm sure some Dems would freak out, but it's not out of the realm of the possible.
That would be Robert ‚ÄúHunter‚Äù Biden, correct?
When Joe Manchin, who many thought would be the Ben Nelson of the Biden presidency, is ALREADY talking about getting rid of it, a year before there's any real pressure to do so, it's gone.
Joe Biden says Trump's failure to lead is responsible for historic economic slump
This will be Biden‚Äôs America if he‚Äôs elected!!!!!! Oh wait................this is Trump‚Äôs America and will continue to happen if he stays president
79 Y O, you are sounding like Joe Biden, Jr. We are a ‚Äú ... Republic for which it stands ...‚Äù.  For the good of the District and the country RESIGN! And take your meds.
FYI Mr President. This is Not how it works. THIS IS NOT HOW ANY OF THIS WORKS. We Have our vote. Nov 3. More Americans will vote for Biden, he gets more votes than you. You lose. You leave.
Get this out.  Biden is an abuser of children.
My counteroffer is if they go fuck themselves and I‚Äôm still not voting for Biden. üôä
Biden didn‚Äôt make yeezy‚Äôs.... neither did trump ü§î
So, Biden should pick Obama as his Vice President. That would shake EVERYthing up. Talk about a game changer.
Start pushing on Joe Biden to sit for ONE interview and ask real questions. Amazing the democratic nominee gets a free pass from the media. Even  Chris Wallace asked trump hard questions, joes turn
Uh, Hickenlooper would be representing an Obama/Clinton/Biden state. Don't think it'd be awkward at all.
The biggest issue with this upcoming election is the Supreme Court. We need trump out to preserve our rights. A vote for Biden is the only option. I won‚Äôt debate this
I love how he‚Äôs using his mess as justification for saying electing biden will be what we get.
On an unrelated note Ryan, will you be changing the name from students for trump to students for Biden after November?
You still need to apologise to Biden.
Biden should name Obama his VP and then step down after taking office.
Carolyn Maloney has become a frequent target of primaries.  Collin Peterson is hanging on for dear life this cycle. Richard Neal has faced a couple primaries but remains to be seen whether he's really at risk of losing. DeFazio could very well go down in a Biden midterm.
WTH???  Is he losing it along with Biden now?
Let's keep this rolling past 1/20/21 so the incoming Biden Administration can undo this travesty.
Hard to fathom that anyone would vote for an obviously demented Joe Biden.  I know, I know ... he‚Äôs just the ‚Äúplaceholder‚Äù candidate for his to-be-named VP running mate who will, in short time, be President when Joe abdicates. But still ...
No, Biden‚Äôs election won't end the nightmare by
Black Voter: I‚Äôm not voting for you Joe. I‚Äôm just like anyone else. I can think for my own and make my own decisions!  Joe Biden:
Texas, which has the closest thing to a free electricity market, is the state with the highest percentage of renewables, which are significantly cheaper than coal and even natural gas, depending on location. #MarketsWork  #NCGA #NCPOL
I won‚Äôt ‚ÄúTake a blade to my own conscience &amp; vomit up a vote‚Äù for Biden any more than Hillary
Ahahhahahhaa Biden isnt giving you weed either bud
Too true #Biden has a long career of pushing institutional racism of mass incarceration &amp; authoritarian legislation like the Patriot Act &amp; the brutal, global racism of war Trump corruption was in the private sector, Biden corruption was on taxpayers
45 has done significantly more harm than good imo. i don‚Äôt think biden is perfect or even great, but between them i definitely align more with the direction he wants to take.
Sure, Hillary was an epic corrupt corporate warmonger who only serves donors, never us But #Biden has the cognitive decline factor that shows spectacular contempt for voters

if not looking to argue i will make my answer short: i don‚Äôt love biden by any means (i wanted bernie), but yes i certainly think he will do better
How were those quarterly numbers today?   Trump has taken us to an all-time low, but yeah, Joe Biden.
I support free market capitalist system, it has improved the lives of MORE PEOPLE than any other system in mankind.  Biden is full on Marxist/Socialist.  I dont want Gov to control everything, &amp; dictate how i live my life.  I want my individual liberty &amp; freedom! #Trump2020
I think she's voting biden ü§£
Love you Bernie, but no.  Biden has been dead quiet this entire time while you‚Äôre the only candidate actually saying anything. And he‚Äôs the one who ‚Äúwon‚Äù the Primary.  Trump is going to destroy Biden in November if we all assume he‚Äôs going to lose.   Please, go out and vote.
Lol blame Trump on everything. It‚Äôs okay the Democrats will lose again. Biden will lose a lot more than Hiliary. Democrat hates old white guy and they chose Biden that have been in politics for 50 years and all of a sudden he knows how to help Americans.....he was w/ Obama lol
Okay, but I don‚Äôt give af about ‚Äúemerging market traders‚Äù....I care about American traders (me) who trade first world market companies.  So no, screw Biden.
The best test for this is asking people if they think Joe Biden is a conservative. You get some interesting answers!
Lol it‚Äôs gonna be like 3 weeks into October with no election results certified DC is in absolute chaos and all the Biden cucks are gonna be like ‚Äúguys, guys, we have to do this peacefully‚Äù
Jesus, this Thursday is a shiz show. Can we start again?
Biden in April: Trump will try and delay the election. GOP/Trump fans: Biden is being hysterical. Trump today: We should delay the election.
Imagine getting tear gassed or worse for joe Biden.
I'll put my face shield on... and go vote for Joe Biden.
The economy is the only metric that middle-of-road voters trust Trump on more than Biden (probably because they only have a surface-level perception of his wealth). Losing the economy is losing the only legitimate card he has left to play.
Try it homer, any state that illegally delays the election will not be counted in the EC totals of those who obey the Constitution, Biden will either reach the threshold to win or he will not, but you will not, which will mean the house decides. Either way you lose.
The problem is that no one can understand what Biden saying
Because Biden ran in 2016...........
Clueless old fool , loves the attention. He has been wrong over and over again. Americans need to wake up and realize this is about his support of China and the Biden campaign. Trying to keep Americans fearful .
My aggressively unscientific (even by my standards) poll of twitterverse on "Who will Biden pick for VP?"  And of course, I'm just stealing  's legwork on this. As usual.   We'll know the answer by next week at this time, or soon after.
You haven't done the slightest bit of research.

Joe Biden's notes: 'Do not hold grudges' against Kamala Harris
Pelosi is a liar and Biden is a poor dementia sufferer.ü§®
Joe  Biden, Jr., the record shows Pres. Trump is doing a far superior job than you and former Pres. Obama did handling The swine flu. Go back to sleep.
you may or may not be aware that when asked if asked to be your VP, Tammy Duckworth said: ‚ÄúIf Joe Biden told me his best chance at winning would be for me to go down to VA hospital and mop floors, that is what I would do.‚Äù
the VP choice is all yours VP Biden. However I hope you strongly consider Tammy Duckworth. A woman who has military experience, experience serving in the House and Senate. A woman who represents veterans, wounded veterans, and disabled Americans.

Joe Biden will be ‚Äî by far ‚Äî the most liberal Democratic candidate in history and I‚Äôm all here for it. I‚Äôm also totally here for literally any of the talked about candidates for VP. We have an embarrassment of riches.
Mr President the left by design wants to destroy small businesses because most side with you. Joey Biden doesn't care about these people.  Arrest these a-holes!
Now Biden publicly proposes the marketing of our children?! Why,.. That's what I've feared all along, but never imagined he'd have the cajones to admit!!....(üôÑsarcasm)
I‚Äôm more anti-Trump than I am anti-Biden. Maybe one year we can nominate someone that doesn‚Äôt make me hold my nose. Maybe a guy like Andrew Yang...
I have a Joe Biden joke, but I just forgot it.
He loves it when you call him a racist. It energizes his base with no positive effect on the Democrat voter given that Biden is a racist too and all of #BlackAmerica knows it.  The pattern of turning everything into racism causes legitimate claims to blend into the background.
Also hasn‚Äôt Biden said he wants to be single-term? So what‚Äôs the issue.
I‚Äôm gonna beat up joe biden
Pondering votes from the Biden bro
I think Biden will offer trump and his family full pardons in exchange for not doing anything stupid while Biden is president-elect
He‚Äôs confused that was Biden who said that ‚ÄúPoor kids are just as smart as white kids‚Äù ~Joe Biden
Not excited about Biden?  Cool.  Just know that voting third party or not voting keeps tRump in office.  Surely you don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs exciting, right??
Who cares if she is ambitious? With Biden's age, she could very well assume the presidency any way.
There is a certain group of people who were mainly motivated to vote for the candidate who had the best chance of beating Trump. The clearest path for Democratic victory is in states (PA, MI, WI) that most people think love Joe Biden. So they voted for Joe Biden.
No one is afraid of Joe Biden. Try harder.
these Purge anti Biden ads are hilarious
No disagreements from me. He deserves a top position in Biden‚Äôs administration.
Boring Biden strikes again. If he picks Bass they both might literally put the media to sleep between now and e-day because there will be few hot takes to go on.
I wonder what percentage of those 20 are either out of cycle or clear of their primary and in a safe seat. My guess is 100%. Gotta stretch those fiscal hawk wings a little for Biden‚Äôs term. Don‚Äôt wanna come in cold
Interesting. So Biden should just pick whoever he thinks he would work with the best.

On point 1, THATs politics. She showed she is a tough, independent thinker. Why do we have problems with women who do that?   On point 2, you only have to see how many times Biden ran for president to see how hypocritical this "concern" is.

Ahead of Trump‚Äôs 16th visit to battleground Texas, yet another poll shows he trails Biden  keeping his immigration promises, namely ending birthright citizenship ,  would have been the only way to save TX.  Look no further than CA to see the end result.
Based on public platforms &amp; statements if Trump wins the election in the Fall its going to stay &amp; if Biden wins the election in the fall the government will put in something new. Voters (who are the consumers) can vet &amp; consider this fairly big issue and decide accordingly.
Oh, and also one where Biden nominates Anita Hill as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court

And for people who think ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just Trump being Trump‚Äù and doesn‚Äôt reflect the modern GOP, this is what the segregationists  published a month ago:
Biden‚Äôs housing plan is quite good. And the mandate to ‚Äúaffirmatively further fair housing‚Äù is from the original 1968 law that was signed after King‚Äôs assassination. We ignored it for 55 years and now are giving up on it after 3.
Oh, dear.  Our whole world is a considerably more dangerous place because this vain idiot is #POTUS.    Vote #Biden in 2020.
Given Biden's apparent aversion to doing anything that might lead to a negative ad it'll almost certainly NOT be somebody who ran in the primary or somebody with a long public record.  I think KLB is probably the best bet tbh.
Oh no! Not pictures of Biden with CHILDREN! üò± üôÑ#TrumpTheDisaster #AllYouHaveIsProjection
Very disappointed you hosted fund raiser for Joe Biden.  Shame. Guess you should have spent more time with Tim Allen
I‚Äôd rock‚Äôm and I‚Äôm a 53 yo boring dud who my wife says, has no fashion style.
Seen BIDEN speak. Oops
He was smoking everyone in the polls til harris/warren/pete &amp; co dropped out, and collectively endorsed sanders. I mean you couldn't have even blind to that right? Biden was a solid 3rd or 4th until they did that
Could say the same thing about Hillary, Biden, Obama, AOC, Pelosi, and the antifa and BLM mobs that go about destroying property and assaulting people.
Very interesting that  doesn't even attempt to make dog whistles like Nixon and Reagan and others did.  He comes flat out and tells "suburban housewives" to be afraid of Biden's pending "war on the suburbs."
"....and NBC News can project that Joe Biden has won the state of.... Alabama?!" ü§£
I agree, it's hard to trust anything coming from them. They're calling it a loan, so at least there's a chance it isn't a give away. To me it's the first sign that the Feds are taking this seriously.  6 months and he's not involved, up to Biden's people to make it work out right.
I agree that Biden exhibits some concerning speech issues &amp; seems to have deteriorated health over the last year or so. Dementia can set on quickly so debates prior to this cycle really don't interest me. Feel like we're voting for Trump or Bidens VP tbh
six more months until we have Trump again or Biden. Either way it is SIX MORE MONTHS OF THIS #COVID19
sorry, tweeting a lot today but it's now 6 months until we have Trump again or Biden either way, it's six more months of THIS... don't you feel some urgency???? #Covid_19
The optimism of a mind in cognitive decline is not something I can get behind  Running Biden shows utter contempt for voters
Have you heard Biden rejecting this? Nope. No democrat have said anything. In fact, they say they are "peaceful protesters"  I'm a Naturalized US citizen &amp; seeing this behavior breaks my heart. I'm not unamerican unlike some native American.
I mean he just continues to be bluntly racist. I don't want to hear Biden isn't your pick. Make sure you are registered and please vote this monster OUT.
I actually think they threatened legal action b/c the contracts to run as a democrat were insistent they all fall in line.  Hence tulsi endorsed biden
Biden said that he is 100% in agreement with  diverting the funding.
Trump can be a horrible choice without making Biden a good choice.
Or maybe he's not, I'm not sure why that is so important if it has significantly less mainstream support than either #Biden &amp; #Sanders  If #M4A isn't on the table, #Bismark isn't even in the room
I didn't know #Biden was pushing for #Bismarck..
I think I may have seen a bumper sticker.  Oh wait, may have been an old Obama/Biden one.  ü§£üòÇü§£
He might want to start that diet right about now.
I'd guess that our allies are waiting just as desperately as we are for Biden to undo all of Trump's damage.
From what I've been told, Biden has been leading in this district.

I don't understand how everyone can get behind Joe Biden. Does everyone not remember the last  16 years before trump? No jobs high taxes, consumer pricing through the roof. Then there was George Bush, who decided it was better
I just listened the quickie. That Joe Biden grant for minority owned businesses that small business oppurtunity fund sounds a lot like what Kamala Harris was advocating for on the debate stage.  It's looking like she'll get the VP nod.
I think this is very telling.  If Biden came out and gave a cogent and thoughtful interview it would be a major coup for his campaign. It would go a long way to dispel the rumors of cognitive decline.  That Biden‚Äôs campaign won‚Äôt do this sends the opposite message.
Because it would make Biden a martyr &amp; anger Democrat voters.
Is Biden blind?  Are they hiding vision issues?  Because you always see him with sunglasses inside and being led around like he cannot see anything.
First of all, I haven‚Äôt seen Biden‚Äôs plan for anything, much less Heathcare. Secondly, the market determines wages. Artificially increasing wages just leads to people being laid off, only the best of the best candidates being hired, and over-working employees.  Simple economics.
The funny part about this is that if Biden wins and Trump refuses to concede, who does he think is going to take to the streets and rip shit up on his behalf? Never-Trump Republicans? Panera Liberals from the suburbs? OK good luck.
Joe Biden Says He Will Force Americans to Fund Planned Parenthood Abortion Biz
Watch Biden's remarks on how he's mobilizing a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce to deal with the caregiving crisis in our nation.
I just love how the ad (and the version running in NC) is just Fox News people talking and then an out of context Biden voice interrupting them to say "Yes". It's so stupid and, sadly, likely effective
Except for when she didn‚Äôt even bring up #M4A while co-chairing the Biden-Bernie health care task force?? I mean-
No, no . . . I don‚Äôt see that. Now, Biden, absolutely.
On Covid-19, Biden doesn‚Äôt have any new ideas. On climate and the economy, his ideas                are liabilities, writes   via
I agree with this take. Being 'republican' as it relates to conservative political policy is considered, by many, to be a thing of the past now that populism runs rampant. The few clinging to that have nowhere to go (although they could do worse than super-centrist Biden).
They‚Äôre working w/media to make us think Biden is leading. Meanwhile, Biden is hosting speeches in community centers. I‚Äôve been in Co &amp; NC, I haven‚Äôt seen any Biden signs, not one but I have seen several Trump signs. Pay attention to details.
I haven‚Äôt been very enthused about voting for Biden, but this guy is really selling me on it idk.
Biden claims women of color 'have never had a fair shot to get ahead' in America    That's right Joe , because you spent your whole career keeping them down. hypocritical moron.
I‚Äôm pretty sure every news outlet has written 4 different articles so they can post the one needed whenever Biden makes his pick. I‚Äôm just telling y‚Äôall to chill ‚Äî damn
I'd love to see them swap it io just this once and let Kamala debate DT, and Biden debate Lego man.
At least Biden can stand up straight.
You think Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt keep up with current events?  Guess you base your opinions on your father‚Äôs lack of knowledge of current events as well as American history, world history, and geography.  Your father apparently can‚Äôt read.

Biden has already said that he plans to raise taxes for everyone. How else is he going to pay for his expensive programs?
your BS ads on TV that there would be a ‚Äò17 minute hold time for 911‚Äô in ‚ÄòBiden‚Äôs America‚Äô are an insult to my    first responders, who have fantastic response times.  Fear based rhetoric won‚Äôt work this time, sorry.
Joe Biden's had a decades long career in politics because he's not a moron. He understands what too many other campaigns didn't: most voters aren't on Twitter.
This is why he's leading the polls. Joe Biden is smart enough not to take stances that are out of step with the voters he needs to win the election.
This does not say she won't vote Biden.  It's a reflection on the history of party realignment at various points in history.  She even name drops so people can Google it.
Biden must be drugged.  That‚Äôs the only explanation.
Don‚Äôt forget that Biden took questions from reporters for 30 minutes today while Trump has hardly faced any questions that weren‚Äôt screened in recent months without petulantly storming out of the room.
I will support Biden whomever he picks for VP. I love Harris, Rice, and Demings. Don't know as much about Bass.
Get over 2016. This is now:  I have heard Warren supports Biden from her own lips.  #unify
Oregon voters can vote BLUE again.  Voters across the country may have a different opinion.  If Biden wins, Portland can pray that the protests end, and they can clean up the mess, and rebuild their city.  Good luck.

Biden needs to start over with DHS and DOJ. Among other things...
Joe Biden, when he becomes President, needs to provide IMMEDIATE relief to everyone denied and who had their renewals reduced to one-year at no additional cost to the DACA recipient. As well as immediately enacting permanent solutions for Dreamers, and others, seeking relief.
So I dunno, I think it's OK to be honest that you're going to vote for Biden without pretending he'll be some kind of FDR/LBJ-like liberal hero. If he's pushed to the left by circumstance, great, but having studied his career pretty thoroughly, I'll believe it when I see it
After Democrats announced their terrible, non-platform and now Biden advocating for arresting people for their political ideology, count on me for never voting for Democrats again. BLM protesters have done more to improve lives in a few months than the Dems have in decades.
I've judged for myself. Biden is all there. Trump is not (he thinks it's an amazing feat to repeat 5 words in order).
Of course they will which will only push Biden further right.
Oh FFS. Grow up and quit whining!  Biden could pick a sweaty sock as his running mate and I would still vote for him!  So should anyone that cares about democracy!
It's not false equivalence to say a thing on the right is very VERY bad and a thing on the left is also bad. Some of those protesters did bad stuff. Also, Biden has attacked Trump dozens of times since June and criticized protesters twice. It's clear which one he thinks is worse.
I have a feeling anarchists would not have been reliable Joe Biden voters anyway.

New Biden ad about Trumps #Covid19 Failure is very Powerful.
I understand the frustration, trust me....but partly due to all the Bernie supporters that stayed home in November out of protest, the US has gone in the exact opposite direction they wanted.  At this point, Biden IS radical change from the past 4 years!
Piggy-backing off a culling process in a tweet by  earlier, which of the following do you PREDICT (not prefer) will be Biden's VP pick?   (if your pick is Elizabeth Warren, say so in comments).   If your choice is not one of these five, BLAME BETHANY'S FOLLOWERS.
Hahaha....you won‚Äôt get those from Biden. You keep on teeing it up for us. Obama and Clooney have alot riding on Trump not getting re-elected. No doubt the spy-in-chief and pedo actor are gonna tout that doofus.
#Axios. Not what #Biden supporters wanted to hear
I'm a progressive and I happily voted for Hillary. I don't know what your problem is or how to help you. I suggest you start by admitting you're a tRump voter tho, if you see any reason WHATSOEVER to not vote for Biden. Then you can end by going away. Far, far away from me.

1. Obama presided over the greatest destruction of black wealth in US history while bailing out banks  2. Biden was Obama's VP pick to appease racist centrists  ...
No one questioned it when it was Obama and Biden.
Trump and Biden should have taken cue from musicians and stream speeches at drive ins across the country.  Would give local news across the country reason to cover it locally and get local grassroots involved.
Are you talking trash about Biden, with getting Trump out of office at stake. I wouldn't dis Bernie... Id support him.
my theory is that they may have shared some of biden's script/speech with the press
I hope Biden has some great  names that he's thinking of for attorney general. I'd love to see Adam Schiff be offered the job. I was just so impressed w/ him after the trial. He proved what a masterful prosecutor he still is &amp; LOL, he knows where all of Trump's dead bodies are!üòâ
The  polling average shows Biden up by 3 percentage points in North Carolina.  That's not an insurmountable lead.  In 2016, the average showed Clinton up by 3 as late as October 16. #ncpol
"We're leading in North Carolina,"  said in Morrisville.  He may have been referring to internal polls.  Still, the bulk of evidence shows Biden is leading a tight race. #ncpol
While I agree that mail-in's generally increase turnout, but,  if a place like NC gets rejection rates at anything like the current NJ primary (7.3%), it could lead to an overall swing of nearly 2% in the overall vote.  I don't know if Biden can afford that swing in NC.
my invincible strategy available for a price to the biden campaign is a captivating new persona i call JOE BOATIN'
I think this is wrong. The primary and the debates were way more about policy, particularly the other candidates. There was a fair amount of surprise they did NOT make Trump more of the focus. Biden did that early. The others did not. The primary voters made it about Trump
Biden's rebound from nearly last place (putting Bernie who was killing the entire first half in basketball terms) after Jim Clyburn eerie endorsement said enough.  It was the red scare flag.
You misspelled Biden.
Two things stood out to me. One is that Biden's foreign policy judgments were often poor. Second, Rice is POC descriptively, but has minimal history of substantively representing blacks' interests - well, in large part because she's never ran for office!

In NC, Trump trails Biden by 5ish points. But the incumbent democratic governor holds a +20 margin.
Harris and Warren would have been an interesting showdown against Barr since both are on the VP list for Biden
Why is Chris Dodd on Biden‚Äôs team anyway?  Didn‚Äôt we cancel him years ago after he sexually assaulted a waitress in the infamous ‚Äú waitress sandwich‚Äù incident ?

If Trump wins Pennsylvania, I have to think he also carries MI and WI. Same with Biden. A split on those is hard to imagine.
I've got your Biden enthusiasm right here!
He was out late last night with Biden. They went out for jello before bedtime. And obviously he needs another bowl of Jello
I mean both parties *are* bad. We have milquetoast right-of-center neoliberals who just decided to exclude medicare-for-all and to continue the war on drugs as part of their 2020 platform, and then we have the openly fascist Republicans. Joe Biden ain't gonna stop climate change.
Neither Joe Biden nor the Democratic Party machine represent America. They represent Big Pharma and the Police State.  #legalizemarijuana
Yesterday, Joe Biden's Democrat Party voted no on the legalization of Marijuana in their party platform. If Marijuana was legal everywhere in the United States, several effects would immediately be felt.
I thought that this was likely.  But that was back in March.  Since then, almost every Dem has sold xe/xer soul to Biden. Which I can't imagine happening if they actually wanted to replace him.
In a reverse, a lot of the men interviewed are voting for Biden while their wives vote for Trump.
Fascinating. This guy would have supported Mayor Pete or Bernie but feels Biden is too old.
Don't be surprised if Joe Biden gets 60% of the vote here.

I mean he can't give 24 hour a day live interviews.  He stated his policy, I'd maybe give him at least 36 hours since he last spoke on live TV before saying he's hiding in Biden's basement
Biden is the reason why so many Black lives have been disenfranchised, imprisoned, and ruined by an archaic and racist law.
And it's only going to matter if (WHEN?) Biden gets inaugurated and can throw Barr (and everyone else) in prison.
You are correct. What millennials are going to vote for an old, white career politician like Biden?
My home county of Wake has received some attention from both of Trump and Pence but we're no swing county. Biden is certain to get at least 60% of the vote here.
That 96% GOP vote for Trump here in NC is gonna be a problem for Biden.

Nailed it. It's all self inflicted damage. You mention "Trump-weary Republicans" possibly coming back to him based on Biden's VP pick. I can see a few of Biden's options making moderates nervous. Not sure people outside DC know much about Rice though.
I Gras. For some reason everyone has to believe what Fauci says or the cancel culture comes after them. If masks work, why isn't everything open? In European countries, no teacher has gotten Wuhan from a student. This is all about the election. Biden will be 25thed. Vp will be 46
Are you kidding me? No they won‚Äôt ask him. As it is now, the questions for Biden are preplanned and given to designated press.

Biden emerged from his basement today to have a "news conference" where he was "asked questions" by "jounalists". He called them by named and seemed to be reading their questions from a sheet as they were being asked. Softball, BS questions, too.
Biden claimed that PRESIDENT Trump has no plan for distributing a vaccine for C19.  IT'S ON  GENIUS.  Not like in 2009 when obama/biden had no plan for H1N1.
‚ÄúSmart‚Äù and Biden shouldn‚Äôt be in same sentence. Also, he didn‚Äôt know that Portland officials had stopped the police from acting!
A small percentage of Democrats voted for Biden. Don't act like you have an effing mandate!
When it comes to Industry, and infrastructure, Joe Biden Promising to do all the things The Democratic House has worked to keep Donald Trump from doing, as he is actually doing it. Joe must have been hiding in a closet, in his basement for the past 3-1/2 years.
Cal Cunningham wants to help Joe Biden raise taxes, regulate job creators out of business, and cripple our economic recovery. I'll continue to support the pro-growth policies that will create jobs, promote freedom, and lead us back to economic prosperity.
Idiot Joe Biden is suggesting  that POTUS should do what POTUS already said he was doing.
I don‚Äôt disagree. That said, we choose between him &amp; a horribly corrupt career politician in Biden. It‚Äôs like picking the least smelly turd from a toilet. The end result is still a stinking mess.
Don‚Äôt buy that Jonah, wait and get a chance for entrepreneurs opportunities in China from Joe Biden!
Democrats, and liberals consistantly Mock their President Donald Trump as a Idiot. If Joe Biden was the Superior Candidate. They would be setting up a record number of Debates. Their actions prove the know Dementia Joe is unfit. And they have no one, to compete intellectually.
Is BIDEN even on the call or is he still napping?
Biden is a Moron! Everybody knows this! Especially those closest to him. And those trying to sell him as a credible Candidate.
I'm a Trump fan &amp; loathe Biden with a passion, but he said "Jill Biden's husband."
Hahaha So if you believe this........ this is why you believe Biden is not demented or will do anything for America after 47 years in politics!
This is what Biden is condoning!
Hahaha Biden can‚Äôt come out of the basement! Demented, failed candidate!
No it‚Äôs not a Dem year! Biden is hiding in basement, cities are being burned, Cooper is bankrupting NC, Dems have destroyed Charlotte proper! NC knows if Dems win...... our country will be destroyed!

The buzz started before RNC was coming back to CLT just FYI.  So either CLT knew it was coming and didn't want to disclose or Biden or the Governor or something/someone else big is in talks to come here.  I'm just pissed off all the way around.
Ummm keep up... there is an investigation against Biden going on right now

Well, most would not vote for Biden either. Either leaning left or right, Centrist ain‚Äôt dumb. Pragmatic, maybe. But not dumb enough to vote for someone with clear signs of Alzheimer.
Yet another line of attack that the Trump campaign hoped to use on Biden in which voters seem to prefer Biden.  Who would better handle China?  MI: Biden +2 PA: Biden +3 MN: Biden: +10
Biden's racking up among urban and suburban voters, and holding his own for the most part in rural areas, per the new Fox News polls.  urban vote: MI: D+34 MN: D+52 PA: D+32  suburb vote: MI: D+9 MN: D+12 PA: D+26  rural vote: MI: TIE MN: R+7 PA: R+17
Rough batch of Fox News polls for Trump   Biden's net fav rating is 26 points higher than Trump's in PA (+12 vs. -14).  In MN, it's 28 points higher (+10 vs. -18). In MI, it's 21 points higher (+11 vs. -10).  Oh, and Biden's up big in all the head-to-heads.

Q: what did Biden do yesterday? A: he read a speech prepared for him on a teleprompter. At least President Trump took questions. Biden didn't answer 1. The dems know if Biden speaks w/o a teleprompter it shows he can't form coherent sentences &amp; he looks stupid &amp; incapable. üòÇ
Legal I but not citizen so can‚Äôt vote but you bet I will be part of the movement and work to help get Biden into office.
From the Adult that can‚Äôt see Biden‚Äôs as dvanced dementia! HahaAlways vote for who you think should win ive voted libertarian every election and been told i let other person win everytime lol but you know what when biden starts next war or trump does more terrible shit it wont be my fault lol itll be on their voters heads
That would get me to vote biden but as of not im voting for
Yeah shes not yang but compared to biden or trump its not even close lol
All the polls this week shifted some states around at FHQ, but the work week ended the same as it began: with Biden projected to clear 270 electoral votes on his Strong and Lean states alone.
You have work to do in N.C. We need more support for Biden here and more anti-Trump ads. Get busy! #Biden2020 #EndTheNightmare

I think he needs to pick someone with further political aspirations. I honestly don‚Äôt think Biden will last 4 years as president. Not that that is going to stop me from voting for him...
Yup. They went to Jared.
No rumor Clinton was a regular to pedophile island. They were to old for Biden he likes them about 6-12 years old.
I thought Biden said he was going to pick a woman for VP.üí•   via
you &amp; all your friends never asks other democrats are they paid by Biden campaign? Vernon Jones is right you are paid to shape the narrative of this country. Finally another person has had enough of y'alls bullshit
the best part about my handle is that it's impossible to find me. like are you looking for joe biden? joe jonas? just another joe? it's really a pretty funny joke
The more we see Biden and the more we see social unrest, the better Trump will look.
There was finally a polling update out of NH yesterday (along with a couple of backdated releases from UNH). That was enough to shift the Granite state into Lean Biden territory.   PA moved back there too.
This is a rather biased trope. Obama and Biden reduced unemployment left over from 43's housing meltdown and generated economy 45 loves to brag about. So let's look at NOW, shall we? GNP down 33% b/c 45 utterly failed at controlling pandemic.
That will be 9PM Eastern after FL, NC and PA score big Wins for Biden. At that point, the rest will be Karmic icing on the cake!

sounds familiar. Many libs said similar stuff when Clinton was ‚Äú100% gonna win‚Äù then turned around and cried manipulation for years- to the point of impeachment. In the slim chance Trump wins, watch Biden supporters cry voter suppression / ballot manipulation.
You‚Äôre right. RBG should have retired when the Dems controlled the WH+Senate. My point is that anybody who cares about getting a new liberal justice should be doing everything they can to elect Dems. As bad as they are, Biden+the Dems won‚Äôt confirm an anti-Roe judge
We replaced two SCOTUS judges in those two years. If you care about RBG &amp; Breyer &amp; possibly Thomas being replaced by people who won‚Äôt gut Roe v. Wade, then vote for Biden and help to win back the Senate. I don‚Äôt see how voting third party will help to accomplish this
I can if the Dems win the White House+Senate   Unless you think a Democratic majority would vote against Biden‚Äôs SCOTUS pick?
2 things are for sure this November.  1) I will not vote for Trump 2) I will not vote for Biden
And the RCV proposal fails 154-13 with 4 abstentions. The Biden rep argued that with RCV someone would technically win with an initial plurality of support (which would require rules changes to how the convention in particular chooses a presidential/VP nominee). #DNCRulesMeeting
A Biden rep was against the ranked choice voting amendment, and as a result, we'll likely see a split on this one.  #DNCRulesMeeting
So Biden has Obama holding  a rally during what's supposed to be his funeral. What a POS  the Democratic party is.
Here's a fun one. Proposal to institutionalize the delegate deal hatched between the Biden and Sanders camps. This would get rid of the automatic reallocation of statewide delegates (unless released by the candidate) that has been a part of the rules forever. #DNCRulesMeeting
With all of that out of the way -- and an hour in -- it is onto the rules resolution proposals. Up first is the proposal described here (an agreement between the Biden and Sanders camps). #DNCRulesMeeting
that is because Trumpism is a cult. Joe Biden people don't need to be so overtly obnoxious
If your people don‚Äôt show up on Election Day and your opponents are able to coalesce around and actually for vote for one candidate, that‚Äôs not rigging: that‚Äôs just the nature of elections  I say this as a Bernie supporter in a state that Biden won overwhelmingly
This is the only reason Biden has a chance. The masters of the universe don‚Äôt fear him
When is the first debate? I can‚Äôt wait!
If enough people do it a hell of a lot more than voting for biden
Conversely, now the Democrats will insist on a timely election because Trump opposes it.   Biden officially is nominated.  Trump shows Biden to being incapable of running the country.  The Democrats can not postpone the election to get a lucid candidate.  Trump wins.
debate Biden from computers have them put it on national TV both of you side-by-side screenshots no predetermined. questions ask what you want a debate is necessary for you Mr. President
He would be a HUGE upgrade to someone who had to ask a doctor on NATIONAL TV if ok to inject disinfectant into our bodies!!  You cannot compare the mental capacity of the two. Trump is just plain dumb &amp; has no excuse. Biden was born with a speech impairment &amp; had his entire life.
For the time being, get used to states like Florida, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin constantly changing categories at FHQ. It isn't so much a function of wild fluctuations as it is their positions in the averages. Each is around that Lean/Toss Up Biden line.
Remember when Biden said something to the effect that Obama was "clean" he suffered for that inappropriate remark for 8 years.
Biden slams Trump for promoting false COVID-19 claims from 'crazy woman'
And until earlier this week, Ohio has been a Biden Toss Up at FHQ. It is just barely a Trump Toss Up in our averages at the moment, only marginally closer than Georgia as of today. Those are the clearest targets if Biden is to go on offense. 2/2
Ohio is next in line in the order for Biden after the six consensus battlegrounds (AZ, FL, MI, NC, PA &amp; WI). 1/
I agree with you mostly, and don't want to vote for Biden, but I fear we will all be dead in 4 years to make a point.
Woo hoo! I‚Äôm voting      Anyone know how Cooper is doing in polls against NO PLAN DAN?
So while Pennsylvania shifted back into Biden Toss Up territory at FHQ just recall that the Keystone state is among a group that is tightly knit around the Lean/Toss Up Biden line. Around 5 points in Biden's direction.
Amen. America 1st. Best President Ever! Reelect  4 more yrs. If Biden is elected we won't recognize US in 4 yrs. The violence he is ignoring now will become the Norm. Marshall law will be necessary. America won't be 1st. He'll finish selling US out to China.

They want to get rid of Trump and his enablers.  They know Trump is dangerous to our democracy and Biden is a good man and will restore normalcy.
He's not going to  we're not going to have this under control until we have a President Biden. Flipping the Senate will make it easier as well. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
Biden wont allow hundreds of thousands Americans to perish from the trump virus, and he who wont be actively trying to take our healthcare away during a global pandemic. #TrumpVirus
Who should Biden select as has running mate? Harris, Warren or Duckworth? Let us know what you think!
I love everything you guys are doing....keep it up!!! You doing these ads allows Joe to run ads focused on the unity we all need.  And the difference couldn't be more stark than when you see a Biden ad followed by a "Biden will burn down America" ad.  Bravo guys :)
I see a lot of Trump ads on TV in N.C., but few Biden ads, or anti-Trump. Please pick up the pace here!    #Biden2020
I hate it,but you‚Äôre right.Trump will lose his shit when he loses the election.He‚Äôll scream bloody murder about the election being rigged,corrupt,deep state fix.He‚Äôs already laying the groundwork for his cult members.I doubt there will be a peaceful transition to Biden.
The Trump campaign has pulled back on the airwaves in Michigan. That's notable. But the timing is more so.   For comparison, the McCain campaign -- in another seemingly Democratic surge year -- waited until October.
There's another wave of polls from Change Research today, but yesterday's massive release of surveys brought a number of changes at FHQ.  OH to Toss Up Trump (from Toss Up Biden) FL to Toss Up Biden (from Lean Biden) PA to Lean Biden (from Toss Up Biden)
I want to follow people who are as far left as you can go, but without the not voting for Biden nonsense.
You think Biden is radical? ü§£ü§£ü§£
Me! it's so sad. So instead I hang this flag. Someone stole my Biden yard sign last week, so I've tripled down with a new Byedon sign, BLM flag and LGBTQ flag.
Hahah I really was about to go vote for Biden bc I thought that covid might be the one thing they could do better. Never mind
My parents 60th wedding anniversary&amp;my 40th high school reunion are next year. My sisters&amp;I are talking about planning a party for them,as we did for 40th&amp;50th. Today is their59th.Will we even be able to have a party this time next year?With Biden,maybe.With trump? Oh Hells no!

It is so refreshing to hear the common sense discussion of American and its issues coming from candidate Joe Biden, in stark contrast to the incoherent babble coming from DT!
Wow!!! Why not just say what you mean? Just because you typed it that was doesn't make it any less disturbing. Now I understand why Biden has your vote because he's a racist as well and has also used that ugly word.
I think the only way it will happen is if Trump baits Biden. We know Biden has a big ego and a temper.   And Trump will just pick, pick, pick at Biden and essentially call him out like on the playground as kids.
Is NBC actively work on the Biden campaign now?
This post is literally wild. 1. Accusing a president of not steeping down wild. 2. Why the hell would Donny lose? He literally is running by himself. Joe Biden isn‚Äôt sure if he is walking yet... It‚Äôs crazy to think Joe has a better chance then Hillary did. #Yikes
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ yo you actually think Biden will get more then 5 states??? Are you serious? It‚Äôs going to be a landslide the other way. It might be bigger then 2016. This is crazy lol

The Electoral College Map (7/27/20)  Added new polls from Minnesota, North Carolina and South Carolina. [Minnesota moves from Strong Biden to Lean Biden. ...but just barely.] #2020election #ElectoralCollege
GD how did people become so naive? Everything is Trump's fault right? The guy that's been in politics for 3 1/2 years vs Biden, Pelosi, Schumer..that's been running states and cities into the ground for decades.Yea just one block and a few bad apples ruining "peaceful protests".
A "Holding my nose and voting for Biden" vote has no more value than an "I LOVE TRUMP" vote.  A vote is a vote. The level of enthusiasm in casting it has no bearing on the outcome.
Much to sift through in this Morning Consult wave of state-level polls, but don't let it obscure the change in yesterday's update. Minnesota shifted from Strong to Lean Biden.   ...and the margin in the MC poll of MN seems to confirm that on some level.
My 24 year old nephew is very political. He marches in BLM protests, posts ‚Äúdefund police‚Äù messages, etc. and holds a grudge against Biden. He hates trump, thankfully. He doesn‚Äôt like his choices. I think we can count on him to begrudgenly vote Biden.
Or better yet, every single Biden "interview" where somehow he already has all of his answers typed out before the questions are asked.
Biden and Rice have worked closely together.  I love her no BS, facts and big ideas. Not a political creature, she's not trying to pretend to be political, just business. Harris can pander and pose. Put her in charge of Senate Justice Committee. Tear up the AG, JD, and 45!
This will create more Trump's in the future. The tighter the social media companies control the flow, the louder the opposition has to be to get through.   Biden can be soft-spoken as he has their approval. Trump has to scream from the rooftops to get through.
Or vote for  And actually change some shit biden and trumps policies are bassically the exact same fuck them both.
From Donald Trump to Ted Yoho, Republicans are losing with women voters
On the weight of what looks like an outlier, lightly polled Minnesota slips into Lean Biden territory. But like Pennsylvania last week, Minnesota is simply huddled on the line between Strong/Lean Biden. On the upper end of the Lean Biden range as of now.
Lightweight Biden not wanting a debate? How the heck is their concern? Just set up their podiums 6 feet a part and do it in an empty room with just moderators. We can send people to the moon but we cant figure this out??

Imagine a possible impeachment AFTER 45 loses general election? Senate GOP could try to preserve last vestiges of integrity and vote to remove 45 and Pence? Pelosi and Biden could get National Pandemic Laws in place, control spread, increase PPE, Testing &amp; enforcement earlier.

Tucker is campaigning for Biden?
You can highlight Trump‚Äôs bad interview with Wallace, it def told us something about him, but the fact that Biden won‚Äôt even do one, should also tell you something
the sad thing is that many will deflect Biden‚Äôs obvious incompetence and evasion with ‚ÄúWhat about Trump‚Äôs taxes?‚Äù. That‚Äôs why adhering to norms is important, since it can force others too as well.
Biden has rich field of qualified Lawyers, Economists, Doctors,  Diplomats, and professionals assembled.  It is going to be huge lift to get Justice, Education, EPA, State, and Defense normalized; but we're counting on them.
How come no comment on the Vietnam vet that was pepper sprayed in the face at close rage for trying to talk with Feds? How come no outrage over Navy Vet that stood still while Fed beat the crap out of him with a baton and broke his hand? Why do you spit on the 1st Ammendment?

If a vote for someone that's not Joe Biden is a vote for Trump, then it must also be a vote for Joe Biden. Incredible logic
Here is the way I see it. Biden, McConell, Pelosi and the rest of their ilk have been lurking around for decades. Trump has exposed everything that is wrong with the system.
NO ONE WANTS TO DEFUND THE POLICE üöîStop ‚úã saying if BIDEN GETS elected he'll defund the police.
Biden is beelining toward a socialist country. This is not your average dem.
Actually that is not a party thing. There is no space between Dem or GOP elites. You are blind as a bat if you think that is a GOP thing. Biden‚Äôs son with all that Ukraine stuff. We need term limits and we need to end this two party system.
And I'll also lean on something I've said a lot: if we're talking about Texas being among the most competitive states in November, then Biden is already coasting to a pretty healthy electoral college victory. Trump needs the Lone Star state more than Biden does.
Mine is admittedly not a projection that calculates a win probability, but I will say that Biden's chances of winning in Texas are better than Clinton's four years ago.

Uh, yes he is. His healthcare plan is infinitely better than Trump‚Äôs... because Trump and the GOP don‚Äôt have a plan, they just hate Obama‚Äôs. At the very least Biden wants to strengthen the ACA. Trump and Azar just want to repeal what little protection people have
Completely concur.   It is one thing for Biden to push into, say, Georgia, Iowa and Texas. But Missouri seems like a real stretch unless the bottom truly drops out on Trump.
Riding with Biden!!  It defies logic that anyone could vote for Trump.  2016 I get, he was a hope of something different but after his miserable performance over the past 4 years, it scares and saddens me that any American would vote to re-elect him.

That‚Äôs just not true. This shows me that you haven‚Äôt even read Biden‚Äôs healthcare plan:   Don‚Äôt take this election year bait from Trump. He is objectively worse on healthcare. Does nobody remember that he tried to gut Obamacare without a better replacement?
It took just a day for Pennsylvania to return to Lean Biden territory. That underscores number of states that hover around that Lean/Toss Up line on the Biden side of the partisan line. And most are states the president needs to get to 270. ~5 points away.
That‚Äôs been obvious and may happen when Biden announces his female VP.
If you‚Äôll only vote Biden honesty do your research and check out 3rd party options. Biden is trying to take this country so terrifyingly left. People do not understand what socialism would mean for us. Beyond trumps political incorrect behavior do some reasearch on his policies

Of course he has. He just gave away 2 trillion for the coronavirus, 5-6 trillion spent on the virus thus far, andddd interest. But you think Biden‚Äôs agenda would help us crawl out of any of that sad but necessary debt?
Haven't said much about the veepstakes, but coverage of Biden's search has entered the Chet Edwards phase of late stage speculation.
So the race may narrow as November 3 nears, but Biden is ahead of where Clinton was and the pool from which any tightening in the race may draw is seemingly smaller than it was in 2016. Together, that makes Trump's climb steeper. 2/2
The short answer is yes, there probably will be *some* narrowing as the race approaches election day.  But 2020 is not 2016.  1. The share of undecideds is smaller in 2020 than in 2016.  2. Biden's share is well north of where Clinton ever was in 2016. 1/
just fully understand how scary far left Biden is going right now and what that would mean for our country. He could change his path more toward the middle as we get closer, will see, but right now, manyyy dems will vote republican bec they‚Äôre terrified. I‚Äôve seen it a lot Online
Trump might be an a hole, needs to get off Twitter,is trash when it comes to social issues, but SADLY he‚Äôd atleast keep our country above water until hopefully better options. Biden will drive our country to massive debt. I‚Äôd personally love to see the biggest 3rd party vote ever
Relatable &amp; humanizing, like take his car keys away?   Because when Grandmama got dementia we took care &amp; helped her.    Help Trump by voting for Biden so that he can have his diapers changed in prison.
Sadly many dems think they should just vote their party bec it‚Äôs their party. Biden is not the answer fam!
Obviously, Florida pushing into Lean Biden territory catches the eye, but that obscures the fact that the Sunshine state has hovered around the Lean/Toss Up line for weeks.   The bigger deal? Biden is over 270 on his projected Strong and Lean states alone.

Joe Biden should want to pick an ambitious VP to potentially set up 12 years of mainstream Democratic leadership in the White House. Any advisor who suggests that he shouldn't should be sacked.
To quote the Biden campaign: "Don't believe everything you read in Politico." (again, for which Jeremy White is a "journalist," or more accurately, commentator).
Regardless, Jeremy White is highly misleading in his commentary by writing that Joe Biden is "[souring]" on Kamala Harris. There's zero indication of this. His conflation of the opinions of donors with the opinion of the candidate is an indication of his careless reporting.
one of them, among others originally publicized by Politico. My point: complaints are that Kamala Harris is ambitious and that the perk to Biden choosing Bass is that she is not. I find it insulting to both women.
I suppose writers for  like Jeremy White are so dizzy from their own spin, they can‚Äôt tell the difference between ‚ÄúBiden sours on Harris‚Äù and ‚ÄúSupporters for Bass‚Äù sour on Harris. That‚Äôs the problem with dishonesty: it‚Äôs difficult to keep consistent.
Then why did you say that ‚ÄúBiden is souring on Harris.‚Äù This reader recognizes the relationship between predicate and subject. I suggest you edit.
Dear ‚Äújournalist‚Äù Jeremy White: there is actually *zero* evidence suggesting Joe Biden has ‚Äúsoured‚Äù on Senator Harris. Please stop making ambitious women/ black women collateral damage in your manipulation of reality to suit a Politico storyline. It‚Äôs irresponsible and unethical.
With the expectation that Biden can only serve one term, he and the party should want someone as VP who would be the 2024 frontrunner. There won't be an incumbent in 2024 so Dems should be picking the VP likeliest to succeed Biden, not worrying about who wants it "too much."
It better be because the campaign is planning on selling ‚ÄúAmbitious Women for Biden‚Äù t-shirts.
Why hasn‚Äôt the Biden campaign‚Äôs rapid response team  put an end to these complaints about Senator Harris being ‚Äútoo ambitious?‚Äù ‚ÄúUnlikeable,‚Äù according to one man shriveling with insecurity. It renders #TeamJoe toothless. Buck up &amp; choose the *right* message.

Is it so hard for Biden to announce that he‚Äôd be in favor of a UBI study? That alone would go a long way with progressives... i.e. to vote for him, to fight for him. Upside - they learn, become more receptive; downside - really none, other than the cost of said study.

Just a question, on the remote chance that Biden (or more properly, his VP) manages to get elected:  Has there ever been an Administration that has been so radical or detested that We, the People have IGNORED IT and said "Piss on ya! Sue us. You'll be tied up in court for years."

On tomorrow‚Äôs episode of Biden‚Äôs picks: I undoubtedly get called a racist, sexist pig for thinking that Kamala is bad because she kept prisoners incarcerated for their value as cheap labor and threatened poor families with arrest over truancy issues.
Joe Biden has literally been running for president for over 30 years. Fine.  But let a woman move toward the presidency and all of a sudden she's "too ambitious".  Make that make sense.
Every time I hear someone like "What about how Harris attacked Biden in that debate? How will they ever get past that?", I have a sudden urge to give that person a Baby Shark coloring book and a box of crayons.
I'm just gonna put this here again.  Joe Biden is not stupid, and he cares about his legacy.
I live in Chapel Hill. When Biden takes over, please don't let America swing "left" too fast or too far. We need moderate bipartisan leadership.
Nato fees? I hope the Pentagon moves slowly on the withdrawal and Biden cancels it.
Does anyone else thinking that Karen Bass got put on Biden‚Äôs short list to raise her profile for when she gets appointed as Kamala Harris‚Äôs Senate replacement?  Bass is a worthy choice on her own merits, obviously, but the timing of her ‚Äúaddition‚Äù makes more sense as Senate prep.
Sinister stuff is afoot when in order to diminish Kamala Harris, who has been the most vocally supportive of Biden out of the VP candidates, white dudes say they prefer the ‚Äúless ambitious‚Äù black women. I hate it. An insult to Harris and to the women they‚Äôre pinning agst her.

No doubt. But if voters think Biden is equally bad on racial justice issues (unlikely but let's assume for the sake of argument) then the election is gonna hinge on who's less incompetent to address the pandemic  And Trump is too inept to recover there
You‚Äôre absolutely right. Trump has to go. Please get all of your fellow patients at the inpatient mental health facility to vote for Biden.
Joe Biden has been gifted the best footage for his campaign ads. Like, I  hate him and his ads still get me hyped to boot  dumbass out of office in November.
That‚Äôs SUCH an important point. She never called him a racist, she spoke up for herself from her own lived experience. Biden is sending an important message by not holding that grudge.
Trump can be a horrible choice without making Biden a good choice.
Obama/Biden?? ‚ÄúAffirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) is a provision of the 1968 federal Fair Housing Act[1] signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson.‚Äù You‚Äôre racist AND stupid!
The trump campaign is running ads that are getting increasingly violent and terrifying, showing old women and children in danger because Biden wants to defund the police (he doesn't and won't).   I'm rarely shocked by any of this these days but wow there really is no bottom huh
They really thought Biden was gonna pass up the chance to go down in history having shared a ticket with the first Black president AND the first Black vice president.
Even if Biden doesn't win the state (which is likely), Trump will still have to dump tons of money into Georgia just to keep it red. That will hurt his campaign elsewhere.
If you don‚Äôt wanna vote, fine. I‚Äôm not even gonna try to sell you on Biden. That‚Äôs not my job. But assuming you wish to vote out Trump, this is your chance to do so. Act accordingly

Great piece Kate, as usual.  I try to remind myself that Biden turns 78 this coming November, and so his VP candidate could very well end up being president.

You will not be safe in Joe Biden's America
My 25 Point Plan: 1. Biden wins by a landslide, Dems take Senate, keep House 2. Biden assumes office 3. RBG retires 4. RBG spot goes to Anita Hill 5. Biden‚Äôs entire cabinet is women 6. Feds and all states attys general indict Trump, Barr etc on 1,127 crimes
Won't quibble with you about Trump v. Biden bc they don't ask for your 2nd choice on the ballot. I just wish more people realize that a vote for either of them in a safe red or blue state is the truly wasted vote.
I have deep seated issues with them but I refuse to allow Trump even the slightest chance at a return or the GOP any say in how things go for the next four years.  You're not really voting for Biden, you're voting for a better government even if its by degrees.
There is simply not enough support for a 3rd party candidate and the Republicans are counting on leftists to split their vote between Biden and someone else to make up for Trump's abysmal ratings. That's what happened in 2016 and it gave Trump the win.
Biden is the choice for a progressive Supreme Court pick to replace RBG, she will not likely stay for much longer. Biden is the choice for more progressive judges and a prevention of Trump. We can start undoing the damage that Trump has done to the judicial system.
Folks are really gonna be disappointed in that Biden administration
People are trying to foster division. All of you will either vote for Trump or Biden. Anyone who doesn't vote or votes 3P has to babysit Trump while the election returns come in and until he leaves office. This f*cker lies constantly and is trying to kill us all.   Hard choice?
I am obviously going to vote for Biden, but this is beyond stupid.   Arson is a crime.   Anarchism is a political ideology.
I would frankly love to see an Idaho poll right now. Have you seen the PPP Montana poll that just came out? I want to see South Dakota and Wyoming, too.  Biden‚Äôs not going to win there, but Trump‚Äôs not up 20, either.

The only thing that would have made it better; if Biden showing up with no pants.  Barr is to smart for those blockheads.

While I do have a preference, I am not going to mention her name, and I will fully support whatever great choice Joe Biden makes.
I do thinking voting can solve our problems.  But we have to vote, and we have to vote with the end goal in mind. I'm not getting my Universal Income and Ranked-choice-voting under Biden.  But I might get some not-sex-offender supreme court justices.  And that's a start.
That's why I compare Biden to radiation therapy.  No, it's not "safe".  Yes, it sucks.  But it will stop the disease and allow is to begin to recover.  And recovery will take a long time.

How some of these  people feel about the inconvenience of wearing a face mask... is basically how I feel about voting for Joe Biden. I know I have to do it, but every time I think "this sucks and I do not like it"
The Biden campaign has done at least one major event with all the big Dem candidates, which I think is good. I just think it‚Äôs interesting because it was such a big field, and they‚Äôre all doing so much. I know they usually all do some surrogacy. But this seems extra.
It sure isn‚Äôt.  Biden said he would veto M4A himself, and there‚Äôs a revolt at the convention brewing over it.  Also I can hold the Dems to account AND oppose Trump at the same time.  It‚Äôs really quite easy.  Your willingness to settle is why we have a mediocre candidate
The new bullshit defund the police ads from Trump amaze me. Like not only does Joe Biden not support the movement (unfortunately), at this point Trump is literally just running on scaring old people into voting for him.
Just a whole racist, misogynistic mess that doesn‚Äôt do anyone any favors and makes the Biden campaign look messy and petty.   Chris Dodd can munch my

Id love to see proof.  Biden can say whatever he wants while hes campaigning.  Hes been in power since 1972.  The problems are getting worse. So even if he is an advocate for change, hes really bad at it.   Why vote for such an ineffective poltiician then?
Biden is willing to fight for workers' rights. No progressive should sit out this election. Biden with a unified Democratic Congress can enable the most progressive change in recent US history. #VoteBiden2020 and then hold the Biden administration accountable.
Joe Biden: as reliable as a Studebaker!
Biden cant support decriminalization, taxes on the wealthy, medicare for all, defund military and police.  What is there to vote for but a tired racist old white man stuck in the politics of the 1970s and 80s?  The sad thing is the left and youth will be blamed when Biden loses.
North Carolinians are ready to elect Joe Biden and Democrats up and down the ticket!   Join #TeamJoeNC and  Sunday, July 26th for a 100 Days: State of the State Event and Phonebank!    We need all hands on deck. Can we count on you?
It's so awful.  They say "Biden want's the police defunded...listen closely" and then they play a clip of Biden saying "yes".  I know they're counting on the stupidity of the voters but even I'm surprised at THIS level of stupidity.
Susan Rice would be an excellent vice president.
The cult around Biden is just as insidious as the cult around Trump
Bunker Biden is funny coming from a guy...supporting a man who, in a moment of truth, cowered in the nuclear bunker.
We already have an extreme and extremely incompetent president. Biden will be anything but.
Plus there‚Äôs this
Biden needs to reach out to respected black civic leaders and get their opinion on how to deal increased racial divisions and distrust of the police. Trump has been very weak on these issues and Biden can do much better.
CHARLA MANGE SAID BIDEN LIED ABOUT CALLING YOU THE FIRST RACIST PRESIDENT. I KNOW HE LIED, ALL THOSE DEAD PRESIDENT WAS RACIST, BECAUSE THEY OWNED SLAVES, THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE TAUGHT. BIDEN, NANCY. ALL WHITES IN THEIR LATE 60'S OLDER GRANDPARENTS TAUGHT THEM.
"Whether I'm his running mate or I'm a door-knocker, I don't mind. I'm going to do everything I can to help get Joe Biden elected and to help him succeed as president."
Seriously, you should write out to move toward that. Not typical CATO Overton window stuff, but roll up sleeves and get dirty. After 2022 election would be time for the deal w Pres Biden. You‚Äôll never get it w Rs in full control. I‚Äôll comment on it/help etc
I think the question is at least partly one of consistency. Will there be tolerance of resistance to Fed authority under, say, President Biden? You can't be a secessionist out of power and Federalist in power (that goes for both sides). We won't endure as a nation on that path.
Times have changed. Asking about the past is relevant to a degree, but the circumstances being what they are, your question doesn't really serve any purpose except hinted to be an ad hominem attack on Biden. If you have a very good reason to ask this question, just state it.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hugely important for the campaign and Vice President Biden to understand the importance of this vote,‚Äù  If your faith requires you to try to have your beliefs codified into law that impacts everyone in the country, your faith is incredibly weak.
I despise Biden but politics is ALL about power and control. If the current (R) administration DIDNT care about power and control why are they sending unmarked militia to silence peaceful protestors? Y'all cannot blame the other side for what you're guilty of.
Damage is already done.  I simply wouldnt believe Biden and his team.
I think all Biden will do as POTUS is tweet and say sweet nothing's while continuing to ally with neocons to pass policies that benefit the wealthy elite over people and environment.
I'm still worried that Biden and his team are seemingly making themselves less and less appealing to the progressive left.  I can only speak for myself but I am not voting for someone so stuck in 1970s politics and whose strategy is to actively court neocons.
Not surprised to learn my zip code has one of the highest Biden-to-Trump donation ratios in the country, with ~5% of the donations to Trump. My neighborhood is extremely crunchy.
Dear Sen. Warren:  You are still my favorite for Biden's vice President!
Hey, everybody, everywhere, give, even five bucks, to the Biden campaign. Let‚Äôs defeat Trump across the map and on every front.

I saw an ad for Biden on YouTube the other day and it was *awful*. I actually thought I was a Republican ad about him at first because of the ominous music and gloomy tones. Whoever made it should be fired. And also...

You are going to see lots of arrests when Biden takes over!
The performative military budget cut is irritating af to those of us in NC, where we not only want Joe Biden to win, but also have a Senate seat in play and at least 3 potential House pickups, to say nothing of our state and local races. It‚Äôs an empty, counterproductive gesture.
Beyond the Bubble podcast: Why Biden is underperforming with Hispanic voters
This whole presidential race is stressing me out man...  We don‚Äôt have the good choices..  Trump is simply terrible.  Biden allegedly said Trump is the only racist president in History.. üòí  The party I wanna vote for is talking abolishing cancelling mortgages &amp; rent...  WTH
I don‚Äôt think either Biden or Pelosi, who have taken tens of millions from big pharma, are particularly interested in taking on drug prices either
I know who didn‚Äôt......JOE BIDEN.  It‚Äôs all over for Trump and Trumpism.

In a world where the drug pricing EO's begin a rule-making and implementation process that extends past November and there is a transition to a Biden Administration, the likelihood that the 340B, importation, and IPI proposal are still pushed forward seems pretty high, no?
That's what I've been thinking all along. Make the whole fall all about the Obama-Biden admin coup attempt.
Biden‚Äôs ‚ÄúTeam of Rivals‚Äù Debacle
I don't see her running in 2024. If she turns out to have presidential aspirations- not all do, Nancy has none- it won't surface till 2032. Biden '20, his VP '24 &amp; maybe '28, then open season for AOC. Outside chance '28 if Rs take WH in '24.
nobody is going to notice your brave stand against voting because sadly 90% of Bernie supporters are voting for Biden according to the polls.  You‚Äôre using March‚Äôs talking points but it‚Äôs July.  The chance to withold our votes and doom Biden has gone
Many have trusted you through 20,000 verified lies, bowing to Russia,  deaths thru your actions, and an estimated 120,000 deaths due to your inaction. We have seen you act above the law and the constitution.  Some of us are tired!  Welcome Joe Biden!  #TraitorTrump

Yeah I hear you, and I do hope you‚Äôre right.  I wish Bernie hadn‚Äôt surrendered so early ‚Äî or better yet threatened a third party run unless Biden endorsed M4A.  Next time we need someone who sees the party as an enemy, not a friend to conciliate
I doubt the Trump or Biden administration would tell us the truth about a chernobyl level risk to public health
No argument on that here.  How do you aim to accomplish that with 90% of Bernie‚Äôs supporters voting for Biden?  No one is even going to notice your principled third party vote or whatever.  The third most powerful Dem in Congress got toppled by a principal endorsed by DSA
Well since she‚Äôs literally the face of Trump‚Äôs anti Biden campaign, it hardly matters.  What does matter is that she is tirelessly pursuing our priorities.  Favorability will increase as left media begins to put money behind her.  I mean, Bernie lost a ton of favorability too
NYTimes has maps of Biden &amp; Trump donors by zip code. Triangle doing some heavy lifting for the blue.
I'm left and voting for Biden. We can't let trump win and take our country down completely.
Blue Devils, why are YOU voting for Biden?  A champion of every American, Joe will combat CLIMATE CHANGE and  give everyone access to HEALTH CARE... all while preserving our civil liberties and our democracy.
Biden/Sanders would destroy America.
"Whether I'm his running mate or I'm a door-knocker, I don't mind. I'm going to do everything I can to help get Joe Biden elected and to help him succeed as president."  Susan Rice has never held an elected office. But she's on Joe Biden's VP shortlist.
Biden and Congress have a great deal of work ahead of them. I hope they are up to the task
Biden Kisses Up To Muslim Political Activists; Wants More Islam Taught in Public Schools
I realize this goes without saying but I'll say it anyway:  If Netflix had damning footage on Biden, the GOP would have sued to have it aired immediately or failing that, STOLEN it and aired it at a "coronavirus briefing".
It is a choice between Biden and fascism.  So you choose fascism.  This is consistent with your actions during your entire time in the Senate. #OneTermThom
We lived under Obama/Biden for eight years.  Biden is a known quantity/quality.  With you, they will be quarantined in their suburbs.
Obam/Biden served two terms.  Amazingly, I can‚Äôt remember a single disaster during their terms.  All I can remember is a rising economy and a measure of prosperity.  There was no need for law and order because there was so much hope and change.
Obama/Biden was a time of rising prosperity and humanity.  Trump leadership has been a time of depression, totalitarianism, and  plague.  If we continue with you, I will predict a time of war, hatred, disease, starvation, and  pestilence.
üòÇYeah, a career civil servant and successful VP for 8 years was a creep and it‚Äôs just NOW coming out. All this as Trump had rape charges filed by a 13 yo involving him and Epstein.  Show pics of Biden with ghislaine and Epstein.  That‚Äôs right, THERE AREN‚ÄôT ANY.  Project much?
Can forgetful Biden do it?
I‚Äôm pretty sure Biden lived through some of the other ones
does this mean bernie could be the democratic candidate since joe biden died?
The Top 10 women Joe Biden might pick as vice president
I really wish we could vote Biden in as a sort of interim president. And then when niggas realize how much better Bernie would be, he becomes the real president.
If Biden wins Florida with a margin of victory like that, the election will be a blowout across the U.S. I still think it's a lot closer than these numbers suggest, though.
Do you mean like forgetful Biden that would let the Chinese think that we're mindless idiots and so that the Chinese would run us over? Did you know they already own a lot of our ports?
Sorry, I don't agree but it's always good to talk about things that are important to the future of our country like who's going to do a very good job looking out for us as the next President. Forgetful Biden or Trump?
In all this talk of trying to make Trump go away, we must be aware that a vote for Biden is a vote for mass incarceration. No, he cannot save us. Quite the contrary, much of what we see today started with him.
How exactly does the Biden plan use market forces?  Not quite seeing it through the federal planning.
I am not understanding are you saying you would rather have forgetful Biden be President?
Sure, thank you to debate with respect this is a nice way to talk to others about problems confronting our future. But I don't see how you can say such a thing forgetful Biden wouldn't be better than Trump in that regard. We'd most likely get run over by the Chinese or Russians
i betcha Biden smells like balloons
We need to give Joe Biden a clear mandate - 400 electors #Biden400
We don‚Äôt need to watch Biden - He‚Äôs the one winning without spewing crap out of his mouth.

Dementia? Is Biden attending?

it‚Äôs like dems defending biden
Biden needs to appoint a Special Prosecutor with the time, independence, tenacity, and open-ended mandate of Ken Starr to investigate Trump, his family, his associates, his cabinet, and the rest of the GOP. If rule of law will ever mean anything again, these people need to pay.
I remember when MAGA's were saying that Biden was losing it, good times ü§£ü§£
This is not Joe Biden‚Äôs America. It is Trump‚Äôs Amerika Casino going bankrupt. #TrumpIsLosing
I am sorry that I don't see it that way at least Trump is strong and capable of dealing with agressive people like the Chinese where forgetful Biden would make us look like the laughing stock of the century to the rest of the world, they would think we're all mindless idiots
No. That‚Äôs not what we‚Äôre waiting for. What we‚Äôre all for is Trump‚Äôs plan for dealing with all this. He‚Äôs President, not Biden. And he‚Äôs got nothing except bragging that he hasn‚Äôt had a stroke yet.
I really don't see it like that because Trump is very capable to have to deal with a lot of people who are agressive like the Chinese as we should not look like we chose forgetful Biden as our leader we would be the laughing stock of the century to the rest of the world
That's super funny thank you for the hilarious joke. Though in truth of the matter Trump is a lot better than Biden because Biden is very forgetful he would make us look like the laughing stock of the century to the rest of the world, people would think we are all mindless idiots
Actually, if you think about it, Biden is very forgetful and it seems he would be the laugh of the century as he would make our country look like we're mindless idiots to the rest of the world.  Plus he would make decisions like a 3rd grader where you have to repeat continously
Doesn‚Äôt stopping the protests allow him to claim victory?: ‚ÄúSee, my plans worked, Biden would never have done what I had to do to restore law and order.‚Äù The protests are giving him oxygen for sure, but do not appear to be giving him a ton of help so far.
So if you believe these buckets, T**** has to run the table on the toss-ups to win, but Biden only has to win *one* of them (assuming the leaners and strongs hold on both sides)
Re: polls  Met a lot of Trumpers who won‚Äôt vote for him again. But I know many Trump voters who absolutely plan to vote for him again. The polls showing a huge Biden lead kind of scare me; it‚Äôs not the reality I see on the ground in PA.   Bottom line: don‚Äôt believe the polls.
. has Biden up 51-38 in Florida.
Biden says Trump is the only racist ever elected president. Good God okd man, how about Andrew Jackson? But better, Bill Clinton!?:  BADTA, GATT2, Bank Reform &amp; Welfare reform sent jobs abroad, caused massive foreclosures, safety net, doubled jail populations: people of color (1)
She would have been a MUCH better president but didn‚Äôt campaign well. Sitting on the sidelines waiting for trump to make mistakes seemed to be her biggest strategy. Also only ran negative campaign ads that I recall. Biden is doing better and his ads promote his positive agenda.
As someone who was sexually abused as a little girl... I didn‚Äôt vote for Trump and cried for three days when he was elected. Biden likes the smell of a child‚Äôs head‚Äîask moms about that. He‚Äôs never bragged about grabbing them by the genitals.
I don‚Äôt care how racist, I mean enthusiastic, 1/5 of the voting public is for trump. Biden will crush him and restore functionality and dignity to the country.
Honestly at this point I'm j getting ready for 4 more years of trump because all of us hate biden but he's the only one that will realistically beat trump given america's shit political environment like good luck convincing boomer centrists to vote third party
But isn't it nice to know that Trump doesn't mean the chaos he is creating? He is only using it to illustrate what could happen under Biden.
Obama and Biden conversation!!!!  Vote Biden
Is there a reason why the news media is dead-set on talking about gaffes and not Biden's revolutionary plan to make dependency more affordable, whether it be for young children or elderly relatives?
Joe Biden has an obligation to take the test? You mean like Trump‚Äôs obligation to release his tax returns?
This is not Joe Biden‚Äôs America. It is Donald Trump‚Äôs latest failed casino.  #TrumpVirus #TrumpGestapo

Biden Tells Muslims He Wishes Schools Taught More ‚ÄúIslamic Faith‚Äù
So Trump and Barr are just illustrating what America would be like under Biden. That's a relief.
Look this didn‚Äôt even start with me saying ‚ÄúTrump is racist.‚Äù In fact, if you‚Äôll look, my main comment on the original Biden comment was that what Biden said was idiotic.
Joe Biden is do middle-of-the-road, he‚Äôs boring. He‚Äôs the perfect antidote to trumps chaos and ineffectiveness.
I think this is (yet another) mistake by Biden showing he doesn't really understand the issues he's speaking to.  Trump's sins are many, but trying to draw a circle around Trump saying "he's racist, but we're not" is missing the message of the movements.
Good Morning! The Biden campaign doesn't care what polls think when it comes to picking a VP. They care about MONEY THEY CAN RAISE. They are down to their final 4 candidates. So tired of the punditry around this. Fast forward to the DNC already and then quickly to November.
Ugh, Joe, seriously?
During the anti-Japanese bigotry of 30 years ago, a Chinese guy was assaulted for being Japanese. Sikhs get attacked for being Muslim. So Biden's not wrong.
these are my favorite takes.   *shows literal footage of trump's america*  "this would be biden's america"  ...up is literally down to these folks
Remembering late Ct Sen#AbrahamRibicoff who told it like it was, called out Chicago Mayor Daley 4 "Gestapo tactics" in '68 Dem convention. Portland mayor Wheeler &amp; POTUS aspirant Biden fall back on wussy word "egregious" - what a member of a stuffy Brit social club might say
‚ÄúThe Los Angeles-area congresswoman checks off all boxes ideologically, and would be a capable leader if something happened to Biden.   And most importantly, Donald Trump has no idea who she is.‚Äù
It is time for the Mayor of Portland to be arrested and charged with terrorism. He has created an environment of hate. His actions have hurt minorities.The not so new Democrat way. The new old standard in Biden‚Äôs America in his America minorities will suffer as before.
4 years ago, I‚Äôd agree with you, but Biden‚Äôs Gun czar is a dude excited about kicking in doors and grabbing ARs in the middle of the night.  And I don‚Äôt blame anyone for prepping on either side of the aisle or in between given the insanity of everyone right now.Can we please get a presidential debate with Trump, Biden, and Kanye? Please??
Trump and psychos got the pics and footage for their campaign ad to convince the gullible that is Biden‚Äôs America when we allknow it‚Äôs Trump chaos
Joe Biden doesn't strike me as a man who lets external forces like these sway him easily

Allies say Karen Bass's reputation as a bridge-builder would make her a strong partner to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
Then I conclude you either 1) Don't know what a "hawk" is, or 2) Don't want to publicly list the countries that need intervention. This isn't a trick question. You said Biden "hopefully" picks a hawk. Peak neolib. Maybe the mask slipped.
Nothing they say surprise me they own Joe Biden they own the DNC!
You said you hope he gets a hawk, someone who is pro-intervention. My question is not stupid. By hoping for a hawk, you are hoping for intervention. So you do or don't have a few countries that need some of Biden's freedom? Or is this my 8th question you refuse to answer?
Biden's gotta git gud but it's not off the table. If he gets Tulsi for VP it's a done deal.
More examples. What am I wrong about? All the kids he grabs are the children of Republicans. Is this behavior normal to you? How would you feel if it was Trump doing this instead of Biden?
montage from Media Matters of on-air personalities taking Biden to task for (now rightfully) suggesting Trump would try and find a way to delay the election.
Yea I'm ignoring "Never Biden" Democrats really not worth taking seriously right now
They probably believe in harm reduction (which I disagree with) but I'm not going to shame them for it. While I won't vote for Biden since he's effectively a 90s Republican, I'm not going to shame the anyone but Trump crowd.
So Biden isn't picking Kamala as VP¬ø? Bad.

With Valerie Jarrett helming the Zoom call, it really does feel like Biden is running for Obama's third term.  #Election2020 #Biden
That‚Äôs strange. Just got a fundraising email from Biden that says he and *Elizabeth Warren* will win back the White House this fall. I must be reading this wrong...

go watch the videos of Joe Biden touching on children IN THE WHITE HOUSE..the democratic party has committed fraud against the Negro people
you sound just like Biden ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not black if you don‚Äôt vote for me‚Äù, the democratic party literally created the KKK, Joe played a huge role in the 90s crime bill that led to more mass incarceration, you haven‚Äôt looked at Trump‚Äôs policies that have benefited the Negro..REsearch
That‚Äôs because no matter what we are voting JOE BIDEN 2020
You know if Joe Biden Defeats Trump and Trump refuses to leave Office he has no Power and Federal Agents will escort him from the White House! Or maybe Trump will get a Majic Bullet like JFK.
Only Congress can change an Election Date! Not Barr! Not Trump! Even if Trump tried to stay on January 21st 2021 he wouldn't have any Power as the new incoming President Joe Biden!
Fact!!!  He and Biden should get adjoining rooms at the Nursing Home !!!
actually look at the things trump has done w his policies compared to obama‚Äôs administration for the Negro people. If anything Joe Biden is more ‚Äúracist‚Äù he played a huge role in the 90s crime bill...this is America you know how many ‚Äúracist‚Äù presidents there has been?üòÇ
Straight, white men are a trip sometimes y‚Äôall. Imagine being so privileged that your American experience allows you to view Biden‚Äôs election is the end of the nightmare and not just a transition to a new, slightly less shitty phase of the nightmare.
The 20th Amendment! If Joe Biden Defeats Trump whether he tries to stay as President he won't have any Power! Your Times Up! You better go on your own!
Even if Trump could Cancel the Election if Vice President Joe Biden Defeats Trump and Pence would not have any Power! Only Congress can change an Election which Nancy Polosi won't do! Trump should leave Office Politiy like Obama or be escorted out by Federal Agents!
every state elects their own personal imbecile,here in Ohio we have several with Jim Jordan at the top!All the real Republicans that wouldn't accept a lying racist sexual predator who is clearly in debt to Russia need to win as many votes as possible for Biden
Trump can't Cancel the Election! Because of the Corona Virus, a War or any other reason! If Vice President Joe Biden Defeats Trump will have to leave Office January 21st 2021!
You mean what is happening NOW under the current president who is actually not Biden?  What are you smoking?
What are the odds that he loses, refuses to concede, the incoming Biden Admin negotiates a deal in which he is not prosecuted by DOJ if he agrees to leave.   I think that's all he cares about. On the upside he'd probably sell everyone out, up to &amp; including his kids, to do it.

Senator Karma Harris will beat Trump and Pence like a Red Headed Step Child the way she debated Vice President Joe Biden just shows how Tough she is! Warren and Others are good Candidates, but Our African American Friends won't support a White Woman!!!

That‚Äôs a lame argument. Nice attempt at laying all the ‚ÄòCOVID deaths‚Äô at Trumps feet. Typical lefty deflection. Rice is a proven hack and Pence will mop the floor with anyone that Biden..errr the DNC picks as VP, just as Trump will demolish Sloe Biden in the debates.
BLM Gives Their Donations To White Men - Joe Biden  via  WHITE BLM/ANTIFA!
I think you need to get your facts straight,Obama/Biden set race relations back 100 years . Joe Biden is not capable of completing a sentence without his handler‚Äôs . The thugs in the streets of major cities looting burning and destroying private property is the Obama legacy.
Biden should find new allies.
Considering Biden himself has said he‚Äôll be a one-term President, shouldn‚Äôt he *want* a veep who‚Äôs ready to take the reins in 2024?
I choose Trump over Biden!
Any of them have their positives and negatives. Biden needs someone who is comfortable working with and can trust to push back on him when needed. I will be okay with any of them but hope it isn't Warren. She needs a bigger economic role.
If the man would quit tweeting he would be fine...... Don't worry in Nov you will be relected just said people hate Trump so much they willing to vote for Joe biden. I want to see the debate between them Joe Biden can't make a sentence oh dumbass....
Joe Biden is a KKK member &amp; is responsible for mass incarceration AND student debt being the way it isüò§

I would prefer that he choose a woman of color, but I will vote for Biden no matter his choice of vice president.
They legit don't read policies, shit is public record and easy to find. It's the same with Biden's platform before complaining just see if it's a platform of his.
I swear I thought that was Dementia Joe Biden!! "If you don't vote for Dementia Joe, you ain't black!"
first of all: is that an intellectual reference? damn wow look at you growing more importantly: Joe Biden actually listens to his constituents and takes into account their beliefs to make the party more inclusive.  I can see where you'd be confused. #youthvote #Biden2020

Kamala is a cheerful campaigner; she and Biden could energize each other and a crowd. I wasn‚Äôt happy with K‚Äôs crafted ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù on busing, but Susan Rice is vulnerable on the Benghazi b.s. Every one of our Democrats will have a role to play in Biden‚Äôs Administration. I can‚Äôt wait

Barr is the biggest mistake the Senate ever made! I don't know what this disgusting traitor did last time he was AG but this time he's out to get revenge on all Democrats using the Justice Dept. Maybe since they r doing it the Dems can when we elect Biden in Nov.

Yes, and he elaborated on another podcast, with Dan Crenshaw. He literally says its more of an indictment on biden than it is an endorsement. He jokingly says he would vote for Whoopi Goldberg before biden. Sooo, the more you know, i guess?
Where on earth are you seeing that it doesn‚Äôt transmit to and from children??? That‚Äôs utter nonsense.  And no one expects it to just go away if Biden is elected because it is a health issue not a political one but you wouldn‚Äôt know that listening to our fascist in chief.
This is literally TRUMP'S AMERICA you are recording. Biden would never bring in federal troops in neighborhoods, he would respect local officials.
I think you are misinterpreting what he said. He said he would voted for anyone over Biden, and how the dnc failed terribly at producing a viable candidate. Weither he actually votes for trump isn't really known.
Don't put any money on it.
Joe Biden unifies, Donald Trump divides . Which side do you want to be on ?

The idea that Meadows will be out in November is reason enough to vote for Biden.
How, exactly, did I shit on Bernie? Biden only answers to his corporate handlers, assuming he's still lucid. 'Womp womp' as a response is dismissive, partisan, and narrow-minded, but then again it's about what I expected.
You're gonna tell me Biden's people are going to help ordinary folks? That he'll sign off on M4A, for example? Trump's a symptom, not the cause. It's a systemic problem.

DELETE BIDEN for sure.  The guy can't put a sentence together how can he run our country.

Sort of. I believe they felt others could stand stronger against Trump, but remember DC is all about special interest &amp; politics! Just like repubs, Dems wanted a candidate they can CONTROL! Biden is that guy. But I do think with fundraising, he could pull more money.
Imagine if Biden were half as cool as Republicans pretended he was.
Oh I agree, Biden will be a controlled puppet but still, they had so many other better qualified candidates than this.

America is primed for this Election Yr. Americans are out of work, our children are out of school, LEO‚Äôs are retiring &amp; leaving the Force, &amp; BLM governs w/o representation other than Dem Governor‚Äôs &amp; Mayors readily endorsing them. Biden is running on the BLM ticket.
Most definitely. I live next to Camp Lejeune here in Jacksonville North Carolina. All the veterans and service members are America loving Patriots. Not seen 1 Biden sign but a whole lot of Trump flags.
Doesn‚Äôt America deserve to know Biden‚Äôs involvement concerning the FISA Warrants? He &amp; Obama both knew Mueller‚Äôs Investigation was unpredicated &amp; unwarranted. They knew from the beginning yet remained silent while Trump was made to suffer, protecting his reputation.

Barr‚Äôs making it clearly known neither Biden or Obama will be prosecuted concerning anything revealed by Durham‚Äôs Report, why? If Mueller‚Äôs Investigation had found evidence of Collusion what do you think Trump would have suffered? Not only Impeachment but Prison.
3 men ran Campaigns from a basement. 2 were leading a War Campaign w/1 of them being Hitler, who eventually failed. 1 was Soviet Ldr Stalin successfully managed the war from beneath the streets of Moscow. It‚Äôs not Trump who should be compared to Hitler it‚Äôs Biden.
Aristimuno has no business being on your show. He didn‚Äôt answer 3/4 of the questions put to him &amp; when he did attempt to answers he jumped around like a Mexican jumping bean. Biden can‚Äôt hide, unless he‚Äôs just plain afraid to confront Trump. I think that this IS his problem.
Why isn't anyone talking about Hunter Biden and his corrupt dealings anymore???  Why is everything swept under the rug when it comes to the Democrats?
The only other example of someone ruling from their basement would be the very man Biden likes to compare Trump with &amp; its Hitler. Hitler ran a delusional war w/Ghost Army‚Äôs that didn‚Äôt even exist. Is Biden any different? He leads a nonexistent Campaign

I think Joe Biden, if elected will be Obama's 3rd term. Obama is very sneaky and this is his way of getting a third term, maybe another after that.  Obama is the one that refuses to leave the White House...Not trump! Obama needs to be investigated.Well, lets see, you camped out at Kavannaugh's trial like a psycopath, then gave Biden a free pass for the exact same "crime". You sound like a reasonable, unbiased, open minded individual who people would love to watch, not sure......
If masks/SD are so important why are riots/protests allowed, why John Lewis funeral with packed crowd allowed? But regular people denied funerals, cant see sick relatives, cant run their business?  Hope you arent voting for Biden at least.
Only thing I would say is there is a (very minor) comeback on Trump's part in the last couple weeks but dunno if it's regression to the mean or if there's something reflecting the start of a momentum shift. Biden lost GA last week and OH this week in the polling averages.

I just wholeheartedly believe that Sen. Harris has the experience and the passion to help take VP Biden over the threshold.
Which could explain why Hillary lost some of the weaker lean states as well.  This time around tho, Biden would still have 302 EVs if he lost ALL his tossup/lean states as of right now (7/31).  Hillary Clinton OTOH, would've only had 190 EVs if she lost all her tossup/lean.
Addendum: "Tossup" or "Tilt" D/R means a 2% margin or less, an average that's well within the margin of error for the other side to take the state.  Biden OTOH could lose all his tossup/lean states and a likely state or two (which didn't happen w/ Hillary) and still win.
Trump is racist, mean, narcissistic, has n empathy, or compassion. He blames everybody else for stuff. Doesn't take responsibility for nothing. Grabs dem by the pussy. Makes fun of a reporter with disabilities...shall I go on? Biden is not any of those things. No dementia either.
tired of hearing the sexist complaining about VP candidates for being too "ambitious." If he wins, Biden will be 82 at the end of his first term. Ambition is baked in.
Meanwhile they used the State Department to help HRC in ‚Äò16. Remember Chalupa &amp; Ukraine?  Meanwhile they used their loyalists in the State Department to impeach Trump? Remember Bill Taylor &amp; Yovanovitch (bad dyed red head) also Ukraine   [They] just want to corrupt Biden‚Äôs case
Biden, you don‚Äôt even know who you are.
Here's the pre-election map in 2016 v. current in 2020.  Yes, Biden only has 12 more EVs than Hillary did, but notice something?  The fulcrum decider was at Lean D closing in on Tossup D (2% or less). 2020 is Likely D (5-10% margin).  ATM (7/31), this isn't 2016.  #election2020
They have nothing to gain and everything to lose by debating her. But if Biden is going to pass on the Debates, maybe they should offer the spot to the next highest in the polls?

I don't think you understand what the differences between 2016 and 2020 actually are.  More Bernie supporters are voting for Biden than they did for Clinton. AND less bernie supporters are voting for Trump in 2020 than they did in 2016.
Biden's daily challange is Oatmeal or Raisin Bran and then call it a day.
Ignorant comment. Trump done more for blacks than any sitting prez. Go check out Biden comments over the years... he hates blacks. Hates gays.
Trump doesn‚Äôt want to be re-elected, that is the secret reason he wants to delay the election. Current polls are not showing a convincing win for Biden. With a delayed election he has time to sink even further in the polls, lose even more votes, and thus be assured of losing.
Many Bernie supporters don‚Äôt have a preference of Biden or trump and will not vote for either. Enough that trump wins by a heavier margin than 2016  Not sure less 10% is many
I think she was pinned in the primaries about her background in law enforcement and if your not informed you take it and run like Rickey Smiley did I believe this process of VP was messed up from the start honestly we are voting Trump out and not Biden In the office
I just saw this tweet, so why don't you take a look at this. There are not very many Bernie to Trump voters. Bernie supporters have a MASSIVE preference for Biden
Well, I don't want to put words in her mouth but I think she's saying it in terms of historical perspective and context.  For instance, the revisionism on Obama that he could have magically installed single payer but didn't so he and Biden are republicans.
"You"?. I'm not with the Biden campaign. I'm just amazed that input from two guys who haven't held elected office in almost a decade is coming to bear.
If you think Biden is the best candidate, then vote your conscious and Vote Biden. If you think it's someone else, vote them. Don't let the polls dictate your opinions.

remaining, somewhere between 8% &amp; 10% will vote for a third party candidate. Now the difference is 35% for Trump, and only 25% for Biden.  25% doesn't win elections. A solid, dyed in the wool, 35% of Trump voters can. Mock them, call them deplorables, laugh at their candidate, 8/
and not see a single "Biden 2020" sign. That scares the doodoo out of me and it should scare Democrats, too.   Back to the "lukewarm/so-so" 65%. If history holds, less than half will actually vote, which means that the horse race is a lot closer: 35% to 33%. Of those 7/
And that's the point. The 65% who don't like Trump aren't in love with Biden. They're not committed. Go down any street in the country and you're apt to see a half dozen "Trump/Pence 2020" yard signs.   In freaking AUGUST!!!  More than likely, you could drive for hours. 6/

One would think that being in office for 8 years would have given him the opportunity to do this.  I‚Äôm sure Biden widen will make it happen... oh wait he was a Senator for 37 years.
Biden is getting NSI briefings right?
Even though Trump can‚Äôt delay the election, he tweeted about doing just that.  Seems like that‚Äôs justification for Biden‚Äôs comment.
There is no world where Biden is ahead of/even with Cooper.
Obama! You haven't done anything for the black community in 8 years. Since you and Biden never offer us #Tangibles and #Reparations, we will hold our votes and stay home! #FBA #B1

Do you read the whole story, the Republicans sent the crack the Republicans wrote half of the crime bill but all I hear is Biden
I‚Äôm wondering that myself. It will be interesting to see if anyone tries to pivot. I assume many will say the Deep State defeated Trump temporarily and claim resistance against Biden is necessary. Others will try to dismount.

It's no secret that Joe Biden, a stronger backer of ACA, is the nominee. It's no secret millions of Americans have healthcare thanks to ACA. It's no secret that Americans overwhelmingly support ACA.  It's no secret that M4A won't pass Congress.
Biden must be set up by the Dem. party as a puppet president. Somebody else is going to be pulling the strings if he's elected. Who is it? Hillary? NWO?

Kamala Harris coming out to give her Vice Presidential acceptance speech for Joe Biden #KHive #BidenHarris2020 #KamalaHarrisForVP
Again I am probably going to vote for Biden lol
My stance on the 2020 election: I don't want to see Trump win, I don't want to see Biden win but I do very much want to see Trump lose lmao
I've been dissappointed in Biden's old crony buddies conducting VP search. This news advertises politics as usual, not what this country needs. And let's be honest, we need a VP who can step up when called. What's wrong with ambition?
Reinforcing the fact that Biden did not earn his spot as the nominee, which is obvious, as Bernie had won three states beforehand. What the people want doesn't matter to the democratic party, supposedly the opposition part. Tight! Hell yeah, pimp!
Mitt Romney will say he's voting for Joe Biden in October, mark it down guys
Just in case you haven't been paying attention.... Demonrat leaders, antifa, blm, the WHO, the CDC, CNN, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Biden, Soros &amp; Obama have guaranteed Trump's reelection. Every statement, response and action made gives Trump a few thousand more votes. TRUMP2020
Then why would I support Biden?  His platform is a massive increase in size and scope of government.    Trump has not controlled spending and that bothers me but part of it is that Congress and politics (we may be in minority regarding size of govt) force him to compromise
Uhhh if you're not voting for Biden you're saying it's ok for trump to stay in office. No black group in the history of black groups would say leave trump in office, except Republicans in blackface.
Technically, I think congress would have to change the date. I think this is a line in the sand that would spark real violence if crossed. I do find some comfort that Biden is seemingly taking this very seriously and working on potential legal actions.
But even if the courts fail to force a state to hold an 11/4 election, it'd have to be a tipping a point state on the way to Biden winning 538.  That state doesn't exist because any governor that'd even be tempted governs a safe Trump state.
Look, everybody! Antifa, Hunter Biden, mail-in vote fraud, other shiny objects!!! Keep looking at all that stuff! Do NOT look at GDP shrinking by 1/3!!
Some in America believe the same Susan Rice is a worthy nominee for Vice President with Biden.
So let's call it over and we'll just install Biden in the fall.  See ya!
If you cant see by now, that Satan is protecting his own, then you are blind. Nadler survives a car wreck, Ginsberg wont die &amp; intends to spend her last days in her chair to spite Trump, Clinton, Hussein Obama &amp; Biden get away with crimes and Soros! Satan is protecting HIS OWN.

Biden is a career politician.  If he pardons Trump, it would be because the congressional GOP made him a deal that was worth the political fallout.
Biden got blasted by the right for saying that Lmaooo. They live in their own world I swear
what say you now about Biden predicting trump wanting to delay the election? Apology in store? Nope, like trump, you wouldn‚Äôt dare admit you were wrong.
If the left wing democrats weren‚Äôt scared, why are they not confident enough to do away with mail-in voting or to delay the election? Biden will still win, right? üòÇ WRONG. #trump2020
Ppl are mad at trump because he woke up the racists and speaks HIS truth.. I‚Äôd rather know who my enemies are than to have a MFer like Biden kiss my ass and feel the exact same way behind my back.. some ppl don‚Äôt get it...
He was a Dem his whole carreer and was highest ranking senator prior to his death (Biden spoke at his funeral)...  He voted NAY on the 1964 civil rights act (vote roll pictured below)...
This is only because he thinks he may lose. Any time he's behind in the polls, he calls it fake news. Should Biden win, we all know he's going to claim the polls were rigged. It's like he can't accept fault in any way, shape, and/or form.
Joe Biden was... right?
Any average person (ESPECIALLY black person) that thinks any politician has their best interest in mind, is insane. Trump, Biden, Obama, Clinton, Bush, all the way back to George Washington. All of them were flaming psychopaths
The only thing these funding initiatives will do is create a tax write off for Biden‚Äôs massive tax increase that‚Äôs coming in 2021.. Funding children‚Äôs education sb a priority, if i‚Äôm a black single mom in DC, Philly, etc.. i‚Äôd register my child in the nearest private school asap
If the news capitalizes on this it will knock Biden's lead back up.
I just did the math. If 1% of people who voted for trump in 2016 in MI, PA &amp; WI switch their votes to Biden (and all other states would remain the same) Biden would win the presidency.
‚ÄúThe Constitution really has been a workable document in many respects because we have had people who more or less adhered to a code of conduct...‚Äù  45 doesn‚Äôt care about traditions or norms or a code of conduct. That is going to be a huge problem.

They don't even work in your area, you don't vote not voting for Biden, which is your big play. When Biden wins what do you do then cause then you're irrelevant
Biden needs people to walk him around and tell him where he is.  I bet he has earpieces that tell him what to say.   Let's have his ears examined at the debates!
Let‚Äôs call a spade a spade, they do not want him reelected - period. Big tech will do anything they can to push their narrative. Is POTUS perfect, far from it, but at least he puts himself out there unlike Biden.
Hey didn‚Äôt you write an op-Ed about how Biden was crazy for suggesting Trump was going to try and delay the election?  How‚Äôs that one working out?

Didn't Biden say that expecting he'd be too old for a second, or possibly because he might not survive the first? Sounds like it'd be a good thing to pick a VP who wants to be POTUS, to help establish an administration he/she would want to continue in their own term?

I'm honored you are bringing awareness to this early. Not very many people will be happy with a female VP no matter who Biden selects. The media will have a field day and so will social media. All of the multi-race female candidates are noteworthy for the role.
Yes!! üëèüèº Eric - Man, you gotta do better. Seriously, your dad isn‚Äôt any better. Even if Biden has dementia, which I‚Äôm not saying he does, but if so, he‚Äôs still a better candidate. If his health fails, throw his VP in. Trump/Pence are not what we need. It‚Äôs divided us. Times up.
Laughing at the truth doesn't make it go away. Aggressive lies don't change reality. Biden is up in ALL polls, often by 15 points.
This reminds me of the time  twisted a parody into ‚Äúmanipulated media‚Äù because they want Biden to win, Trump to lose and like to abuse their position of power. These people are sick.
If Russia has evil designs on Germany / Western Europe, it‚Äôs a simple matter. Western Europe defends itself. Why should USA? No matter who is president. Biden, Obama, Bush 1 or 2, Clinton. Getting out troops and treasure of foreign soil is in our best interest whenever possible.
Not to mention Biden has himself said he wants to act as a bridge. He knows his age is in play and I think he knew he ‚Äúcould‚Äù not go through a full term (internally) and that ‚Äúhe‚Äù was best suited to beat trump, get Dems back in there, and then pass it to someone like Harris.

I imagine Charlotte will be next as we have a Democrat mayor and governor. And NC is leaning Biden. And a BLM mural painted uptown.

Oh ye of little understanding. Biden will only do what the Dems have done since Clinton, say pretty things to make you think they will do something,  only to not produce and increase their power.
God help America had he not been elected; democrats had rather see America fail than POTUS succeed; show me just one candidate that exceeds his qualifications; just one &amp; why ?Biden is a sleep walker; mouth engages when his brain ceases to engage;he needs to be in a nursing home.
I believe the numbers are being hacked high for political reasons until after the elections;  POTUS is going to skunk Biden; and all hell will break out worse than Hillary; truth is truth; and it hurts those who live a lie; and defend it.
Thats my other point that I tell people... At least we can (or have a better chance to) hold Biden accountable. 45 wont listen AT ALL.

Nailed it. It's all self inflicted damage. You mention "Trump-weary Republicans" possibly coming back to him based on Biden's VP pick. I can see a few of Biden's options making moderates nervous. Not sure people outside DC know much about Rice though.

Hey  I bet you didn‚Äôt know Sleepy Joe Biden was in the Star Wars trilogy... Here he is pictured with a young Luke Skywalker...
All true and the other thing about Rice is that Biden knows and trusts her. Biden is also aware that he will be likely picking the first female President.
Trump, is with it, he knows what he is doing. Right wrong or indifferent. Biden is getting words and letters, people, and places mixed up; this is early onset dementia or Alzheimer‚Äôs. I don‚Äôt point this out to make fun of Biden, it‚Äôs just sad his family would allow it.
Trumps supporters use the same tired ass performance in every interview. Lie, Brag about the economy, black unemployment, throwing a bunch of money behind the military, HBCU funding, lie, attack Obama and Biden, lie, act appalled when a valid question is asked, rinse and repeat.
Or if Biden picks her as VP. She‚Äôs a long shot but she‚Äôs on the list.
Oh they will def try to exploit it but at the point, if this (again about the VP) is what turns someone away Biden... then they werent going to vote for him in the first place.  Looking for an excuse.
They want to bully us into supporting Joe Biden because Trump. Blue Maga is the worst because they don‚Äôt care about actually change, they just want us to fall in line with the #DNC

Everyone sees you! You're a child in a man's body! Your tantrums and lashing out, when other disagree with you prove it! We need an adult in office! Biden can do the job, you can't &amp; aren't qualified/equipped for!
I see this thing in Facebook where someone said; go see how many of your friends ‚Äúliked‚Äù the Facebook page for trump then see how many miles it for Biden. Posted numbers the. Said trump 2020. There are a few things wrong with this polling idea:
Yep all because Obama and Biden committed treason!
This is due to Biden‚Äôs age and the likelihood that he will only serve one term. That makes the VP the automatic Democratic front runner in 2024. Also why I‚Äôm leaning against Warren who is already 71.
Neoliberals have assured us all along that Biden was the popular one and he didn't even need the support of the "fringe" progressive base of the party to beat Trump.  Now all of a sudden they are already pointing fingers of blame at the fringe group they said they don't need.
YOU hate ACA. YOU support M4A.  Just YOU. Did you even vote?  The will of voters was to choose Biden and his healthcare plan.  Voters didn't make any of the M4A supporters the nominee.  Your stubborn, juvenile refusal to accept these facts is why your "demands" should  be ignored
Yep, same as 2016. Tiny margins in lots of swing states. Biden might win by 10 million votes but lose all these states by &lt;1% and lose the electoral college. The mail-in voting terrifies me. Trumps intentionally destroying the post office. Tons of Dem ballots won‚Äôt be counted

Notice turn by Biden yesterday to appeal to the middle that the Dems are bleeding right now. the best thing I can tell that middle is check out this picture üò£üëá
This is why I support Biden. I feel he honestly cares about Americans.
Part of the "radical left agenda üôÑ" Is giving everyone free healthcare during a pandemic and legalizing marijuana and yet, Joe Biden doesn't give a fuck about any of that. THIS JUST IN‚Ä¶ Donald Trump is a fucking moron. These two dipshits probably have a lot in common.
Remember in November...  ‚ÄúSex predator with dementia.‚Äù[Biden]- Mark Steyn
Correct - Biden did this and it is captured on video.  Don't even need a trial in an underground bunker to see it.
I remember what Joe Biden said in the heat of the primaries about Obama.  They worked it out.  I get it‚Äôs the season to be cynical. The Dems decided months ago  they needed to fight Trumpers not each other.  They‚Äôve kept it up.
I can already tell Republicans are going to be insufferable under Biden.

Look here another Biden ad! I would run the f*ck out of this!! Putin must put his phone on mute and laugh so hard at him every time they speak. Trump is such an idiot.
The next GOP candidate is whats really concerning. They will find a smarter version of Trump. Biden better fix checks and balances since its failing. But, he's a corporate sell out. Late stage capitalism here we come.
VP Biden will have smart people around him.  He will listen.  Most Presidents do that until one did not.
If Biden wins the election will ‚Äúconservative‚Äù groups come together to oppose statism or will they continue to fight, deplatform each other, stick to their high school cliques and fight each other for relevance and money?
Nah. He'll be sleeping. That's why we like Biden (even though he is in the center). No drama.
this tweet has actually made me more excited to vote for Biden than ever before

You need to come out of that bubble and accept facts. The only poll that matters is an election.  Biden's plan is ACA. Benie and other candidates supported M4A. The majority spoke when they voted for Biden.
Kamala Harris is a bad pick for VP. Especially with Bass so high up in the discussion, this would be a unforced error by the Biden camp.
Yes, they support ACA. That's why they voted for Biden.   ACA is already law. The public option and further expansion of ACA gets every one healthcare. Take the win.

As a small business owner, and actual job creator, I will be voting for Biden because dead people are not my target market.   Tillis wants big corporations to thrive so they can pay him, and does my care about small businesses like mine in Charlotte.
Come 20 January 2021, assuming that he looses the election, Joe Biden will have to make sure he's escorted out of the WH.  LET'S HOPE THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE TOO GENTLE.

Exactly is not a terrible pick like Warren  like we would be ok üëåüèæ she‚Äôs not a bold or exciting pick but hey neither was Biden tbh
Joe Biden "You ain't black"
I would say we see Kamala as being more of a forward looking option (based on her age) that should would be available to grow with a liberal side moving forward. While most of us feel a two 70+ ticket definitely puts 2024 in focus. Most of us are voting for Biden in 2020...
Biden, Dr. Fauci, Bill Gates or the like on anything? Why aren't these people being vetted? Why every time other leaders say anything contradicting these people and the like, they are attacked and accused of spreading misinformation? Why isn't mainstream media neutral?
In Biden's case it's huge.  She'll probably be President.
on  HITS HOME RUN AFTER HOME RUN!!!!  "BIDEN IT TRYING TO DEFUND SCHOOL CHOICE IN DC"!!!!
I seriously wish you would get the VP nod. You and Biden would make a tremendous team in DC.
Once Warren was out this became a stop the bleeding election depending on if Biden wins then the Senate needs 60 or to remove the filibuster. Not expecting chuck Schumer to do that because he's scary
Biden emerged from his basement today to have a "news conference" where he was "asked questions" by "jounalists". He called them by named and seemed to be reading their questions from a sheet as they were being asked. Softball, BS questions, too.
Biden claimed that PRESIDENT Trump has no plan for distributing a vaccine for C19.  IT'S ON  GENIUS.  Not like in 2009 when obama/biden had no plan for H1N1.
I believe you are correct. I will never support Tlaib after she booed HRC. I hope she is defeated. Jayapal voiced concern about whether Biden can motivate young progressives to get out and vote (a valid concern) but she has endorsed him.
When did the Department of Homeland Security turn into a private militia? Joe Biden is the dumbest human alive
Speaking of hiding.... What's it say when Biden's own campaign makes fun of him? That's the guy you want in charge?
You think people would not vote for Biden if he picked Harris, but would vote for him if he picked Duckworth?
So would those people vote for Biden with Duckworth but not Harris? Idk could be some but would it make a difference you think?

I think Biden's campaign team is having a heart attack right now - I don't think he can ever come back from today's appearance.    He's solidified himself as knowing absolutely nothing and sadly, that there are serious cognitive issues.
So by your logic, Trump is focusing on Biden "a winner". So Trump is obviously the loser.

I think the vp will be able to heavily influence policy and the direction of Biden presidency. I didn't choose him, he was chosen for me. I'm hoping to see someone more progressive to even him out.
The pipe dream, imo, is solving anything at all by replacing Trump with Biden, much less voting. Electoral politics is designed to distract us from the fact that we no don't live in a democracy.

Biden's advantages were simple. Name recognition and the best field position (being the only one to start leading by double digits over Trump).  Lesser known candidates like Yang would've had to prove themselves on the campaign trail (albeit could've done it easily). Biden don't.
Nah.  Trump knows that being in office is the only thing keeping him safe from prosecution. That's why he will pull out all stops to remain in office, even after he loses to Biden.
What I meant on this is each of these 3 candidates had their own strengths which is why I ranked them as my top 3 in electability during the #DemPrimary.  People asked me why Biden 3rd? Never EVER underestimate the power of name recognition. I did.  #election2020
I think a Biden/Clinton ticket beats Trump right now.  It's that bad for him.  I can't say though if it beats a worst-case scenario, but Biden could choose Hillary and still pull it off honestly.
I may not be enthusiastic about Biden, but I am very enthusiastic about getting trump out.
Everything still has to go right for Trump to win though. The debates have to go right, a vaccine needs to happen, the economy needs to bounce back on the ground, and he might even need a spot that can gather up some compassion for him.  It's still very much advantage Biden.
All the comments are, ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt hear this from Trump!‚Äù or on the other side ‚ÄúIf you can go to a funeral you can debate Trump!‚Äù It‚Äôs John Lewis‚Äô funeral and has nothing to do with the presidential race or Trump. Let Biden give his condolences and let John rest, for God‚Äôs sake!

I go to work although I‚Äôm not enthusiastic about it. A lot of ppl will vote for Biden although they are not enthused about it.
Things are looking good for Biden, but one thing I feel he lacks that a candidate like Bernie/Yang has is staying power.  What do I mean? Let's say a vax for COVID comes out in Oct. If it works, this election is a whole new ballgame.  Already, Biden lost his lead by 2% in 2 wks.

Joe Biden  HAS TO BE the BIGGEST PANDERER OF ALL TIME. There isn't enough chap stick to keep those lips moist enough for all of the Black asses he is kissing. He gave them nothing in the past 40 years and he'll give them nothing tomorrow. When will Black voters wake up?
There's absolutely nothing normal about what's going on here.  I don't believe anyone should have expectations of such. Remember junior wanted to debate Biden's son? As if our political process is a tacky reality show....so degraded...
Does Biden really wan't to move into The White House when he wins?  Really? If you think about all the Russian "upgrades" that have been installed throughout he may want to work from home for a few years.

There's actually a chance Biden will not run for re-election yes.

Biden is a Moron! Everybody knows this! Especially those closest to him. And those trying to sell him as a credible Candidate.
It was about bussing. The segregationist comment came later and that was because of something Biden said about working with people you disagree with. The debate performance was about bussing.
Biden did your minions tell you to lie Iike that? Why? Don‚Äôt they know that old people would say anything to get some attention?
This is what you get if you vote for Joe Biden.  The Democrats dream. To destroy the United States of America.
"Unity" behind Biden without demanding more concessions is equal to blind loyalty.  Not demanding more is foolish.  He still stands for profit in healthcare, and that's unacceptable during a national healthcare crisis.  He will bend or lose votes. Simple as that.
I'm a Trump fan &amp; loathe Biden with a passion, but he said "Jill Biden's husband."
If you think these protests will change at all under a Biden presidency because "we're gonna stop being racist", then you literally don't know this country and are just an ignorant fool.  Democrats are equally responsible for the police state and economic hell we live in.

Where has all the money gone?
1) How do we know what‚Äôs actually Obama holding? The picture is from 200 yards away of a blurry figure.   2) Trump supporters know Obama isn‚Äôt running for re-election, right?  3) Amazing how every previous Prez (including GOP) has endorsed Biden. Take a hint America.If only. I still am amazed by people that don't understand how Biden is more of an actual conservative than many in today's GOP. The old fuck will never sign onto a green new deal, anyone telling you otherwise is either lying or deliberately blind, either way, running you around.
Unless you want to have a civil war over government control then no Trump couldn‚Äôt mandate mask nationwide. If Biden thought his audience were against wearing a mask then roles would be reversed and Trump would be wearing a mask that‚Äôs how it is. That is how this game works.

You're gonna tell me Biden's people are going to help ordinary folks? That he'll sign off on M4A, for example? Trump's a symptom, not the cause. It's a systemic problem.

Agreed. One real benefit if Biden (besides his basic decency) is he can hit the floor running. He‚Äôll have to do so... he is inheriting the worst mess ever in US history.
Joe Biden is beating Trump and doesn't need to base a VP pick on a strategy of getting votes. He needs to pick the next POTUS. And knee-jerk reaction to old white men is as bigoted as any racial animus, so give it a rest, Jew.

Only two of the nine people interviewed said they're voting for Biden. Most of the people interviewed sound pretty decided to me. They don't sound like people who can be convinced.
When even the white Repubs are (finally) starting to turn away from Drumpf in statistically noticeable numbers in a state like NC, which has turned purple over the years but still has a significant and powerful bastion of red.
"Corrupt Joe Biden"?  Do you know who your boss is?  Have you looked into his hijinks?  Hilarious.üòÖ
Yes, but if I worked for the Biden campaign I'd knife fight anyone who advocated that Biden get on stage with trump. Paraphrasing cernovich with whom I agree on this point. Keep Joe in the basement
Obama Biden must corrupt huh, says the man who conspired with Russia and has more close associates convicted of felonies, who is individual 1 in ongoing federal charges, yea like you were ever credible? Not. That‚Äôs why America will fire you nov 3. There will be no doubt.
Unfortunately it‚Äôs choice of lesser of 2 evils. We know what Trump is or isn‚Äôt and we hope Biden  makes a good choice for VP because we have concerns about his health.
Biden should turn tRump tower into public housing. #F*ckTrump
If Democrats flip the Senate, it's simply impossible that a Biden SCOTUS nominee gets 60 votes. The Republicans who would confirm a Dem SCOTUS nominee are almost all gone. Alexander? retiring. Snowe? Long retired. Graham? lol
Neither Biden nor Trump "deserve" a single vote, simply because they are part of the duopoly.  If they can't _convince_ me to vote for them, I'd cast no vote rather than vote for someone with whom I disagree.
Biden is responsible for what every democrat in America says?
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Yes, him. That was Biden quoting a memo from a racist while working on passing the Voting Rights Act. Attributing that to Biden is a deliberate distortion, but you already know that.
Who is tweeting in behalf of Biden? Biden isn't capable anymore.
I didn't agree with some of the things she did as District Attorney in SF, but her commitment to social justice is deep, and she would bring some qualities lacking in Biden. Val Demmings would also make a great VP. I admire Abrams, Lance-Bottoms, Bass, and Rice
Per  ‚Äòs request: JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.

It is orchestrated chaos by democrats.  As for a Florida at least it isn‚Äôt because their leaders sent Covid patients to elder care facilities. It‚Äôs a disease that China allowed to spread. When Trump stopped flights from China did you, like Biden, call it xenophobic?
These r Biden voters during the pandemic. I‚Äôm betting u kinda like this?
He‚Äôs normal and Biden is asleep and will loose! Quit crying! You see the mayhem in liberal run cities?  doesn‚Äôt that in the future for the nation‚Äôs kids! Now go to bed like Biden.. sleepy Joe.
be able to breath a sigh of relief until Biden's won by a landslide &amp; Trump's OUT even if it means we need the marshals, FBI or whoever to drag him out of 1600 Pennsy Ave w/ he decides he's staying anyway. I'm not vengeful but I can't wait to see him get what he's got coming.
And I'm sorry for you for supporting Joe Biden and the 45-50 years he's been in office not doing a damn thing for this country both as senator and VP

The Trump Campaign Is Losing Its Mind Over Polls Showing A Biden Blue Wave
The only thing better than Biden winning Texas big is picking up all 38 of its  electoral votes with a razor thin margin of victory. That may persuade some Republicans to support a popular vote.
There are 12 House Dems representing seats that went for McCain, Romney, and Trump. Seven of those districts (AZ-1, GA-6, NJ-5, NJ-11, PA-17, VA-2, VA-7) are districts that probably go for Biden. UT-4 could very well go for Biden but that depends on how the McMuffin voters break.
Obama and Biden
Hopefully, the FCC under President Biden will pull your licenses for essentially yelling ‚Äúfire‚Äù in a movie theater.üôÑ
the only way that will happen is if   wins. #trump and #biden are both racists and perverts.
NC I haven't seen Biden signs either. &amp; Live in the "leftist" area. Wake County.
I have said only pompous,egotistical people could  want to be president. Dem or Repub, they all had a degree of audacity to want that job. Trump is leaving the equivalent of a flaming bag of dog shit on the porch of the WH.  Biden, we will help you scrape the shit off your shoe.
Biden. For. President. Twenty. Twenty.
With Biden up double digits nationally, it only makes sense to consider states like Alaska, Kansas, South Carolina, etc to be Likely R. If Trump were up double digits, we'd be talking about Likely D Oregon, Washington, New Jersey, Delaware, etc.
If he were leading Joe Biden by 10 points then yes that would plausible but he's not leading in polls.
Not sure why they'd be expecting Biden to visit given the whole pandemic going on. So far Biden has made limited trips.
GOP internal polling apparently has Biden up 5% in OK-5.
I will vote for Biden no matter what but I‚Äôm REALLY hoping he chooses a WOC. They have carried the D party for decades. It‚Äôs time for them to get some representation.
By the way, your profile picture is a dog and with Joe biden banner as background. So how do I believ that you are a real person and not a bot? Are you ashamed using your real name and picture?
None of trump‚Äôs madness will be repeated in the next 12 years as our country will work back to normalcy under Biden for 4 years and his VP for the following 8!  World tension caused by trump will also calm as our allies feel like allies again.
I missed the Biden glasses. #LSSC
Trump should pardon Obama, but say he can't pardon Biden until after the election.
I double dog dare Biden‚Äôs campaign to run this. 2 reactions: 1) Trump has a sense of humor and 2) there‚Äôs no way on earth Biden could do it.
Biden doesn‚Äôt even know where he is ... his ‚Äúhandlers‚Äù hand him index cards with talking points ... and he still screws it up.

Joe Biden apparently has a fleet of submarines and didn't even tell us.
Some people get upset when the Crystal Ball or Cook shift their ratings leftward. Biden is up double digits nationally and the generic ballot is D+8. Not hard to see why those ratings get changed.
Biden has over 600 lawyers teed up for election lawsuits. Could we not have a settled winner by Jan 20?
So you‚Äôre saying Biden would be better at diplomacy then Trump
They're laying the groundwork to blame it on Biden because even hardcore Trumpkins think he's going to lose. Which means we need to make sure we get out and vote!
Bogey man arguments are juvenile jr. Grow up you will not convince anyone, except some of your supporters, to support daddy by lying about Vice President Biden. Your big problem is America knows both Joe Biden and your dad. That says it all. Why America will fire your dad nov 3Ma‚Äôam, Trump has been sued for allegedly raping minors and women, but sure, Trump is not a pedophile but Biden is.
Imagine 2024. Biden is prez and the situation has deteriorated. Rs sweep back into power. How happy will you be if they enact their entire agenda. The filibuster is frustrating when you're in power but because Dems couldn't think ahead you now have record numbers of R judges.
why am I seeing a Joe Biden political ad before almost every You Tube video I watch and none are from your ad campaign?  I think Biden will further ruin this country, please start running some ads to get your message out.  Donald Trump 2020!!!
Exactly that is why they are saying Biden is ahead in the polls.  So when they cheat with mail in voting they can claim it was legitimate because of the polls.
I can‚Äôt believe Biden isn‚Äôt asking you to be his VP choice
I think you are confusing my statement.  I was replying to the woman who said biden is washed up...he had his chance.
He was one senator.  You people pretending that biden was some kind of god who could pass laws is stupid.

I choose Trump over Biden!
I sure hope not, because what if something happens to Joe Biden while he's in office?  She will be president.

Joe Biden commercials are so full of lies. Joe Biden and Obama could care less about America. We lost our job's, healthcare, and wages fell. Go away Joe. Enjoy your Billions of dollars you acquired from China. Leave the American people alone!!
1 allegation against 20 allegations. Perhaps you might want to ask  who is suing Trump to get his DNA, and that Trump refuses to give it, even though it would exhonerate him if not guilty. And by the way, Biden is not running as the ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù candidate.
You know folks- they are going to pull the ol switcheroo. Biden isnt their true candidate much less a viable nominee. Focus on strengthening your immune system and bolstering your network.
Kind a like Biden üòÇ
Yes. I‚Äôm worried that if the Election Day numbers are close, Trump will claim mailed in ballots are fraudulent. We need an overwhelming Biden victory on Election Day. So I‚Äôm voting early.
And Biden needs to remain hidden for another 100 days so he has to answer no questions.
Right, the Democrats have to kill the fillibuster if they want to make a change in gun control, environmental laws, economic help, healthcare, and a lot of other things. If they fail to do it, it will be such a disappointment, and Biden and any other Democrat will lose in 2024.
‚ÄúOn behalf of Biden‚Äù means that he will be speaking on suport of Biden smh
Does the Biden campaign even have merch lol

Biden is horrible in my opinion... he is just like trump as well. The thing that makes trump more appealing is that he know what he‚Äôs doing most of the time... we don‚Äôt need a president who has stage 4 dementia.
I‚Äôm tired of you blind Biden supporters not listen to facts. How can anyone support a guy like Trump but liberal. Fact don‚Äôt care about you feelings bitch. We don‚Äôt need Trump or Biden. What makes you think Biden will do the things he‚Äôs been trying to do for 40+ years. (he won‚Äôt)

That's getting toward slur territory.  Since when did a VP candidate wanting to eventually be P become a bad thing? It's what Biden did. Joe better wrap this process up before it backfires on him. People are leaking trying to poison the process with their own agendas (Dodd etc).
Oh, Russia 100%. The good thing is that the planning for this will go past the election. So if Biden wins (just knocked on wood) he can kill this and the most we'll spend is a senior officer's time and effort building PowerPoint slides on how to do this and how much it will cost

Dunno about you, but for me, as to why I feel no emotion about it &amp; don't care is because seriously, fuck it. I'm voting for Biden come November. He'll be better than DRUMPF. If he's removed due to incompetence or death, his VP will take over, whoever it ends up being.

After the bussing policy that kamala called biden out on i dont see how she could be his vp. Its like a white person calling me the n word and say hey lets go out and get a steak tomorrow
Why don‚Äôt y‚Äôall focus on winning in November? Democrats always sabotage themselves by not supporting the nominee. Y‚Äôall act like trump loosing is a forgone conclusion. One day  will be the nominee and she should be supported like Biden should be supported.
It‚Äôs not shameful. Biden won so it‚Äôs his platform. It‚Äôs shameful for y‚Äôall to not support Biden. Nothing matters if trump gets re-elected. The bigger picture is to get Democrats in control of the three branches of government. From there start building on a progressive platform.
True. I do think he has a shot at least, I still think Chris would be a slight favorite. Unless Trump somehow wins reelection, but under a Biden presidency &amp; a non presidential year for turnout ?
Why do Republicans want to push off a shuffling, teetering, physically limited DOTARD with cognitive impairments akin to Alzheimers onto the American people for a second term. Most notable is Trump's constant PROJECTION of his own limitations onto Biden!
That is surrendering to the enemy and waving the white towel Mr. Queen of battle and it's the lie that the left wants people to believe. Do you really think things would calm down anyway? Biden could never be a better choice, ever!
I fail to see how Biden could ever be better for the country.
If biden wins do u think all of this nonsense will mysteriously disappear? Not trying to be a smart ass just asking a question
You wish queen, Biden won‚Äôt even be able to make a cognitive argument during the debates.
Maybe meant to be unflattering to Harris this is actually unflattering to Biden in that it projects that the same old gatekeepers are calling the shots as they make an 'historic' choice. It explains how Bass suddenly got elevated. But Biden has no bad choices left at this point.
I don‚Äôt get the obsession with Kamala Harris attack on Biden. During the 2008 election Joe Biden refused to say Obama was qualified, yet he was selected as VP. Let‚Äôs focus on getting rid of Trump &amp; leave the primary politics behind.
This election is an astoundingly clear referendum on the two views of America.  In Biden‚Äôs America, chaos, appeasement, corruption, open borders, socialism, higher taxes, a destroyed economy, big gov, &amp; a destroyed democracy.  Trump‚Äôs America is the opposite.  Choose well.

I hope that naming Dodd has been part of making it rain for Biden the last two months, because otherwise, it makes very little sense. I appreciate Reid managing to say basically nothing at all but still landing two quotes.

Biden is a man of profound faith who recognizes the same trait in Senator Romney. If you'd like your Latter-day Saint neighbor/colleague/friend/family member to become more familiar with these moments, contribute to  outreach campaign here:
And in 2017, Biden made some waves when he encouraged Romney to run for Senate, recognizing Romney's deep commitment to the common good even as they disagree on policy.
But in reality, the respect goes back to at least 2011, when Vice President Biden went on the record early saying it's "preposterous" to question Romney's Latter-day Saint (Mormon) faith:
The most notable recent example is Biden telling media back in January that in all likelihood he wouldn't be running if Mitt Romney were running for re-election rather than President Trump.
Let's talk about the respect Joe Biden has for Mitt Romney, the only Senator to vote to convict a president of his own party
But Trump is the only one who can‚Äôt run on his record. And Biden always has more substance than Trump and lying GOP.

Stop living in the past and move forward lf God can forgive us of our sins every day surely he can be forgiving of his mistakes. President Biden 2020She didn‚Äôt see Joe Biden grilling Barr this week inappropriately.  Why would she change her vote?
I‚Äôm voting for Biden even though in 1988 he plagiarized a speech, lied about being arrested trying to see Mandela, had a phony silver star story, lied about marching for civil rights, said Bush tricked him into voting for the Iraq war, yet in 1998 wanted it! #SettleForBiden

Rasmussen is a joke. You're losing in most polls and probably in your internal polls too. If you're actually leading in any of them, they're probably fake, made up by your campaign staff. I'm sure your new ads will be as full of bullshit about Biden as the previous ones were.

It would seem wise for Biden to choose a VP who can excite the base &amp; newcomers. Someone who has been building a base of their own for years, &amp; able to generate enthusiasm. It doesn‚Äôt seem wise to pick a more obscure candidate just because she didn‚Äôt debate him this year.
Exactly. Every interview she does she‚Äôs asked about the VP spot and every time she pivots the question to why voters need to show up for Biden.
If Biden were president we wouldn‚Äôt be in a situation with limited football games (and 150k deaths from COVID) in the first place...
No disrespect to Karen Bass, but Biden has at least a couple "rock star" choices on his VP list who have REAL name recognition &amp; who would bring power &amp; energy to his campaign. Karen Bass seems like a *yawn* &amp; a *safe* choice.

It can be simultaneously true that Dodd's Q's of Harris were sexist, while simultaneously saying that Harris is a terrible choice for VP.  A former prosecutor and Attorney General with a questionable record while police brutality runs rampant? Insanity.

Biden should choose Tiffany Cross as his VP! Very impressive interview!

Republikkkan Logic: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to wear Nazi swastika masks not because we‚Äôre Nazis but because if Biden becomes president it‚Äôll be like Nazi Germany in America.‚Äù   What?!?   These people literally make no sense at all.   Watch the video - best line: ‚ÄúTurn off the Fox News!‚Äù üëèüèª

Biden just listened to a woman and a Black man, his best friend. This was amazing.
Weekend At Biden's!
Then who is she gonna vote for? Howie Hawkins? ‚ÄòCause she definitely isn‚Äôt gonna vote for either Trump or Biden
He knows Biden is taking the suburban Republican "Romney" vote.
Every VP has dreams of being President. Hell, Kamala just ran for POTUS! However, she would never undercut Biden once selected as VP.
Biden's going to stop Marxism with a little stutter and a calm demeanor
Joe Biden is a Moderate.  (You don‚Äôt know what that is.)  You and your Republican Party have moved so far to the Right you are fascists.  Any normal human looks like a Left Wing Radical to you.
‚ÄòThis is health care moonshot time‚Äô: Pandemic pulls Biden, Dems further left  Maybe they'll get pulled so far left they'll fall off the edge. Then we'll be done with their silly nonsense.  One can only hope.
President Biden, you made my night! Thank you!
Get over yourself...Trump is the greatest president we ever had!  You want a pres. with dementia vote Biden for communism! It's a no- brainer!!
Obama-Biden operatives had 'shocking' ties to Russia
VP Joe Biden and Jill Biden in the Rotunda to pay respects to Rep. Lewis.   H/t
Repubs: Don't vote for Biden, he wrote the Crime Bill!  Also Repubs: Democrats are soft on crime!
Harris.......Otherwise a Joe Biden/Rice ticket Will run up against a Harris/AOC ticket in 2024
GOP wants Joe Biden to give an interview so bad!! üòÇüòÇ
IF Biden loses?  you mean WHEN he loses.
Why don't we retweet all the states Biden has made and the Obama Administration made then you might get all the followers you need
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN

It's sad yet funny to know you believe senile Biden has a chance
Cant wait to see how Biden handles Covid (sarcasm)
Oh come on...! Lay off poor old  We all know when Joe Biden announces his VP nomination, that mental powerhouse  is gonna make  a scapegoat and sh-tcan him. Nikki wants that VP job. Thus the massive suck up to him.
You can not be that serious??! How did Obama and Biden do ANYTHING for our economy??? Trump built it up and since his stance in office the economy was doing the best it‚Äôs done in 35 years so was the stock markets and unemployment was at an all time low etc WAKE UP VOTE RED!!!
The CDC is being ruined because it has caved to political pressure over and over.  It will take years for the CDC, to recover its reputation as a scientific organization.  Biden will have to clean house in the leadership ranks to save this venerable institution.
Biden says Trump is first racist U.S. president  U if sleepy Joe gets in, he'll be the first pedophile. Keep your hands off those kids, you hairy legged pervert. WTF is wrong with you?
As a real-estate developer you know all about over-developing and I already see that in my suburban town.  Has nothing to do with Biden or the government. Has to do with greedy developers that only care about money, just like you.
They are using this an political weapon designed to blame Trump for the chaos, the discord, the crimes.  Law and order need to be restored and people need to ask themselves if they want the country to go down in flame.  If it is, then they need to vote for Biden
While I realize Trump has made Twitter the de facto medium for his own public statements, please remember that that isn't normal. Biden has in fact made a statement on Portland.Allies say Karen Bass's reputation as a bridge-builder would make her a strong partner to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
How Caregiving Became More Than Just a Women‚Äôs Issue  #caregiving
Joe Biden appealing to Chinese for donations to entice Evangelicals and Muslims to support teaching Jihadism in public schools...I dont think it will work out
There's nothing stopping me from voting, I hope. I've never wanted to vote so much and all my life. Enough is enough! Can't wait to watch Biden voted in
Not nearly as screwed as if Biden becomes president
I think Kamala Harris is a reverse racist and I hope Joe Biden does not pick her for his vice president running mate I do not like the way she came at him when they were deciding who was going to be the Democratic FrontRunner.
This letter to the editor was published in our print edition today on page A4.
Islam is an AntiChrist religion and is to be rejected as AntiChrist. John 14:6. Joe Biden wants Islam taught in schools. He is a puppet of the Spirit of AntiChrist.
But fewer people say the U.S. is on the right track. Plus, how we feel about the future of our jobs and the coronavirus threat. Explore the mood of the country in 8 charts.
Joe Biden is a Moslem

Another lost vote for biden
This literally made me cry. Joe Biden is the kindest, most real individual. I would love a hug from Joe Biden right now.
Exactly. It's not Trump's fault or Biden's or McConnell or AOCs fault it's us and the ststem we enable. #NeverBidenNeverTrump #DemExit #VoteGreen2020
Looser... put the real Biden back on. Why isn't Biden calling for an end to the violence in Portland or Chicago?
No guess about it. You are correct. His 50 year legislative record and his own televised tap into corporate donors telling them nothing will change from Trump to a Biden admin save tone &amp; temperament. #NeverBidenNeverTrump
He's a political coward afraid to be shut out like Ralph Nader was by the democratic corporatists ( Biden supporters now). In my eyes by not using leverage to get concessions for his endorsement he sold out and lost credibility all to save a Senate career in twilight.
Bernie Sanders no longer tops any A list for me after he sold out to the very party and candidate ( Biden) who reject everything he stood for. By endorsing Biden Sanders sides with corporatists &amp; sells out to preserve a Senate career In twilight. Sanders has lost All credibility.
As U.S. debt rises, Biden's spending proposals near $10 trillion
üòÜüòÇüòÜüòÇüòÜüòÇas if one can discount Biden's 50 year legislative record as a barometer of how he will decide or what he will support in the future and its NOT progressive policies. #NeverBidenNeverTrump
Many of those young people, my 4 gen z and millennial kids included, that were Bernie fans are happily voting for Biden. They understand the life or death situation we are in.
