Trump and Biden have the exact same military deferment and 1y rating. Biden play sports throughout high school and college with no problem was asthma but used that to get a medical deferment.

I urge all Americans to VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN.  He's our only way out of this MESS Trump's ignorance and incompetence have caused.
Don‚Äôt worry about Joe Biden he‚Äôs going to make an unbelievable president something your father would never be your father has destroyed the economy fail to act on a pandemic and he‚Äôs gassing Americans A total loser
Maybe that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm representative of that group. But I firmly believe it. Biden is the absolutely worst opponent for him. You can see it in his reaction.
Nope. A more younger and more liberal candidate would suffer in many geographic and demographic categories.  Not with me, but I believe that. That is why Biden so quickly rose to the top. People want to beat Trump.
nobody wants to hear this but young joe biden kinda looks like sufjan
You‚Äôre missing the point. Biden is the nominee because he is the guy who can beat Trump. Seniors, suburbanites and moderates are comfortable with him. But his job is to populate his administration with the future.  HRC (who put Trump in office) is not the future.
Biden belongs in a nut house not the White House.
Biden‚Äôs transition director was on the call this week to gin up support for the RI fundraiser later this summer
It‚Äôs time to move past the Clintons. I loved her husband in his day ‚Äîdespite his colossal mistakes ‚Äî but in the ardent hope that we get a fresh start with a Joe Biden administration we don‚Äôt need to revisit the past and give the GOP a gift
Yeah I think it's a little different right now given the fact that our species will most likely go extinct as a result.  Biden's climate plan, ambitious as it is, is too little, too late.  There's no time left for incremental progress; it's now or never.
Unless there‚Äôs a redux of Bush v. Gore to stop counting at some point in December. Trump v. Biden, consolidated lawsuits from key states, fast track to SCOTUS.
Let me make this simple for you. Do you think your Biden committed a crime when he told the Ukrainian government to stop investigating his son or he would withhold $1 billion?
That‚Äôs just stories. Joe Biden is a rapist. Obama is a murderer. See. It‚Äôs easy
I hope that Biden finds room for each of them who is not the VP pick in his cabinet.

Exactly, which is why I've flipped from Trump to Biden  Decision could not have been easier  Thank you for saying what we are all feeling
Two aides to Joe Biden tell CNN that the VP announcement has been pushed back to the week of August 10 and that his personal deadline for a final decision is next week.  In other news: I am tired.
Remember how Joe Biden held up Italy as proof a public health system does not work during the last debate with Sanders? Now look at what works &amp; what does not. The US is looking at an expanding nightmare, millions uninsured, chaos, inefficiency, stupidity.
I‚Äôm a father of two daughters. My heart breaks for you. I will also cast my vote for Joe Biden, in honor of Jaime.
Well I guess it's he said she said.
I guess because it's Joe Biden?
I know perfect candidates don‚Äôt exist, real change doesn‚Äôt happen through politicians, real change happens through protests and movements. Even if Biden or any other candidate were to make some minor reforms, no systemic change would or could happen through the system itself.
Saying Biden will be ‚Äúalmost as bad‚Äù is like saying an apple is almost as bad as cake because they both have sugar. Perfect candidates don‚Äôt exist. Realize that Joe is at least listening to new ideas.
Joe Biden will not shut down ICE, will continue to use ICE to beat up American protestors as well as take immigrant children away from their parents. He will not end the wars. He will not legalize weed. He will not regulate the banks. He will not bam fracking. He will veto MFA.
Biden‚Äôs presidency is gonna be almost as bad as Trump‚Äôs, but because he seems nicer and isn‚Äôt an obvious fascist like Trump, the media won‚Äôt care. A conservative like Biden is better than a fascist like Trump obviously, but I‚Äôm kinda worried people will get comfortable
If you're upset with me for voicing my opinion of Joe Biden, who I think is a sleazebag given his history that you probably haven't even bothered to research, I think YOU'RE sucking on that same thing that you accused me of.
Really? I've always liked black dick myself. I can't help it if YOU don't like TRUE things about Joe Biden. He's been a racist from way back. I WON'T be voting again in this election just like I DIDN'T vote in 2016. Give me better candidates and get rid of the two party system.

Joe Biden will not win. The numbers are fake news. Trump will win in a landslide.

If you want Trump out of office do not vote for Kanye. I feel like Ye‚Äôs sole purpose for this whole campaign is for publicity and to split the black vote between him and Biden. Thats the only way Trump can win this election.
In fact I volunteered many hours of my time to help VoterChoice2020 successfully get a question for ranked choice voting on the ballot in MA this year. I'm working on RI next. But frankly, if we had RCV this year, I still wouldn't vote for Biden. I will never vote for warmongers.

Ah he is playing the old hits tonight #Biden #TrumpIsNotWell #TrumpIsUnwell
Silly  doesn't know the difference  Absentee ballots are cast for Trump by billionaire New York tax evaders with a residence in Florida and are GOOD  Mail-in votes are cast for Biden by normal people who don't like fascism and dying at the polls, and they're BAD
Imagine being so privileged that you think Joe Biden will Fox the damage corps have done to this nation... rich white suburbanite boomers calling the poor seething masses living gpaycheck to paycheck "entitled" is fucking rich
Will Biden announce his VP this weekend?
you and your cronie Jeff Weaver are going against the movement. Not for healthcare, voting as a superdelegate, settling for Biden. What else will you betray us on in 2020?
Biden sounded smoother the other day, than Trump ever has in front of a mic.  You‚Äôre a fucking assclown.
Coming up   tells  she is NOT going to be Joe Biden's Vice Presidential pick.
Dodd is kind of an asshole, period. The fact that it's on Biden's behalf feels more like coincidence than intentional.
Neither will Biden.
So you must really have an issue with Biden's words as well? Or is Biden different? Are you willing to accept what he says because he's Democrat? Or because he's NOT Trump? How is this any different?
I hear Raimondo and Biden will be meeting early next week.
this is the most pressing issue today?  the location of Joe Biden's adult son?  not the economy?  not Russia? not China? not the pandemic?  not your father's mental frailty?
‚ÄúSee Biden‚Äôs doing better than Hilary‚Äù is not a good argument
Pedantic peeps are gonna be pedantic, but he doesn‚Äôt even do that well.  A vote for Biden is not literally a vote for Biden... it‚Äôs literally a vote for an electoral college delegate who intends to vote for Biden... and in some states has the discretion to do that or not.

Lol Trump suggesting election delay is just his way of firing ppl up to disbelieve the results. If he can‚Äôt win at least he can hand Biden an ever more severely fucked up country who doesn‚Äôt believe in election results
I believe VP Biden stayed his number 1 criteria for a running mate is someone he is ‚Äúsimpatico‚Äù with. He has been around politics long enough to know her attack at the debate was political and not personal. Her relationship with Beau may be her biggest draw with him.
Thank you.  Seeing libs tweeting about how this is trump admitting he is weak or losing.   So?!?! That‚Äôs when he does crazy authoritarian things. He‚Äôs cornered. And Biden isn‚Äôt going to save us.
Biden: black parents cannot read and write. Didn't want his kids growing up in a racial jungle. Corn Pop. You ain't black. Pro-segregation anti busing. Obama was clean and well spoken which was storybook for an African American..... Why is any of that acceptable? You don't care?
Joe Biden isn‚Äôt going to save us from this cornered flailing narcissist.
And then compare to Mondale (Biden) and recognize things can get a lot worse.

... there‚Äôs little reason to believe Trump can win short of massive voter suppression and outright fraud. Those are the real worries, not Biden or some magical Trump turnaround.
And a commentary from The Root.
This election won't be decided on November 4th, especially if Biden supporters choose vote by mail. We have to understand that first while we see this play out. It is highly likely that when we go to bed, Trump will be leading, and even more likley that on November 11th he won't

This isn't very meaningful, in other words it's bullshit, until Biden or one of his official proxies starts saying it. You really think this passes as news, dude?
There are black folks who disagrees with Kamala Harris...they will still vote for Biden if she gets VP...  But if she doesn‚Äôt get it after the news coming out like this...those same black folks could stay home and let it fall as it may...
Biden voter of course. I guess these are the "no empathy" people he was chewing for. Isn't it grand.
This is going to be my final poll on this subject. Who will Biden pick? (Not who you want.)

are "Biden's allies" also saying, "but ... but ... she's black!"
And there is no chance that Trump will attempt to contest the count, and that Biden‚Äôs popular-vote margin will be important in securing the legitimacy of a win against any such attempts?
I've felt for awhile that the Biden insiders are all in for Susan Rice because she's one of them.
Truly what the hell is happening over at the Biden campaign     This is like sixth or seventh hit piece on Kamala in THREE days. Are we doing the GOPs work for them or? Good god. "Too ambitious" to be VP.
Or is it that you think Joe Biden is LESS racist than Trump? I guess the question is HOW MUCH racism are YOU willing to put up with? Is there a certain LEVEL and Joe Biden meets THAT level? You DON'T mind racism as long as it's NOT Trump and IS a Democrat? Please explain.ü§îü§îü§î
Hmm, so Joe Biden is not racist? Given his history of voting against minority interests his whole time is a politician, and given the things he said about black parents &amp; judging who's black or not just recently, what would you call him?
Trump: We must shoot the anarchists in the street! Biden: No! We must round 'em up and lock 'em up!
If your conscience doesn‚Äôt compel you to stand with the only person with a chance of ousting this lunatic from the White House, you might want to get it checked. I get that Biden isn‚Äôt perfect, but voting is about outcomes, not self-expression.
Still think you have to vote for him to avoid the horrors of a Biden administration? Or is screamingly overt racism a tipping point?
. , you‚Äôre *mini Donnie* now as you are everything you always hated in Daddy. I bet he offered you a big pay off for all the lies &amp; bullshit.   Junior, you continue to say Biden has dementia &amp; is unfit. You‚Äôre confused. It‚Äôs Daddy who has dementia &amp; is unfit.
A Biden midterm means that any Democrat in a swing state begins with a disadvantage. AZ could hold if Kelly has a weak opponent, and if Meadows is the nominee in NC, then I could see a flip. I don't trust them outside of that, though. Not even PA. I know better than to be hopeful
With a uniform swing from 2016, the answer would be 2.7%. Still, I could see a Biden win by up to 4.5% where he only gains PA and MI. WI is moving right and is a tough state.
Yes.. pretty much. it's kind of the same way he answered the question from the reporter... When Biden called him a racist..    .. with more racism.  Trump is a disgusting racist !
Wishful thinking. In a Biden midterm, I think this is what we'll get. (In KS, Bollier won. AZ depends on who Kelly draws for an opponent.)
He wants to position himself for 2024 if biden loses. Much easier to do that holding statewide office and looks like baker will run again
...ass off for your campaign and this is the treatment we get. In the middle of a pandemic, you have the audacity to vote for a platform that doesn‚Äôt include single payer M4A. It‚Äôs a meaningless platform anyway, but you won‚Äôt even withhold your vote for it let alone for Biden...
Well that is not Mrs. Biden

I‚Äôve been DJing huge covid superspreader parties for 20 somethings, because the Democrats cooked up the virus in Fauci‚Äôs lab just to get people $600 a week for 4 months. &amp; Biden‚Äôs been dead for years, they‚Äôre just splicing old video up, that‚Äôs why he sounds like a scrambled egg
Let‚Äôs put it this way: if Biden‚Äôs running mate has to take his position if his health/body fails... you really want President Kamala Harris? No thank you. At least with  you know that her presidency would be a continuation of President Obama.
Voters voted before a global pandemic, and Biden's plan is designed to leave millions uninsured.  Why dont you just tell them to eat cake Mark
Sleepy?  Bruhhh   sounded just fine yesterday.  You on the other hand, sound like I do after a 12 pack.  Go brush your teeth and pick out a bra for the day.   #Tump #Biden #USA #America #COVID19 #Corona
I wish this were true. But it‚Äôs not. Biden is trying to stop the revolution to protect the elite and ruling class.
It was Clinton's and extremely bipartisan. Never said Biden wasn't also racist lmao. The whole lot are. But that crime bill made the war on drugs worse. Didn't create it
I recently described Harris as the Biden for Biden. She‚Äôs the ‚Äúreaching across an isle‚Äù of choices. I get he wants a lady and cop on his side, she‚Äôs the best option. But it‚Äôs just splitting hairs on this whole idea of being a ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù (secretly a conservative that talks good).
Oh  is that really a fight you want to have? Trump vs Biden on respect for people of color?
If there's one thing Biden needs, it's a white centrist Wall Street union-buster..........
again?  I told Supreme Commander Biden that we needed to change it every week.  C'mon, do better.
In the meantime Biden answered press questions coherently and FOX News complained that he wasn‚Äôt asked any hard follow up questions.
Main problem with your campaign is we have to come looking for you, you aren‚Äôt broadcasted or shown anywhere. This election needs different candidates other than Biden and Trump.
But Biden won decisively (afterallthecentristsdroppedoutothrowtheirweightbehindcentrism)!
It's overblown is what it is. She explicitly says she's telling people to vote against Trump.  Not to mention I doubt Biden wants her endorsement and the cargo ship of baggage she has along with it.  This is such a dumb thing to hit her on.
Yet more disingenuous meshugas from Chris. It's clear what Biden means are the people causing property damage, not ideologues.
This is very bad. It is perfectly legal and very much protected to be an anarchist. Why are the Dems and Biden so incredibly bad at this? Fascist lite‚Ñ¢Ô∏è is not the place to negotiate to Joe. #Biden #Barr #Fascism

One of the ways I know the election isn't close rn is that Jerome Corsi isn't flapping his gums about some book filled with fabrications and half-truths about Biden, the way he did in 2016 and 2012.

So what is Joe Biden‚Äôs plan to stop the fascist militarized police against poor people? To keep weed illegal to imprison more people of color? Tell me more about how we must vote for him.
The Dems incompetence against Barr *in particular* should terrify everyone much more than Trump does. Barr can execute fascism. Even a Biden victory won‚Äôt neccesarily stop Barr.
Either way, I would have to vote for Biden, while biting my tongue so... At this point I just want to know who he decides on.  This wait is ridiculous!
Maybe he was thinking of Biden from the Onion

Don't worry. Biden is gonna annihilate him. Possibly moreso than Hillary did.
And yet, you endorsed Biden
Biden doesn't have a conviction and y'all still call him a rapist. Only one president had to settle allegations against him only one president had 26 allegations against him for sexual assault. Some against minors. If I was accused 26 times of rape I'm probs a rapist
Too bad  lost sight of everything he ‚Äústands‚Äù for and capitulated to Joe Biden and the Dem establishment
Of course, it's also worth noting the platform is not a binding document and has no actual force of law and D politicians are free to pursue whatever policies they want.  Bigger issue is it means Biden really is personally opposed to the policy.
Let‚Äôs really analyze what this says - a bunch of mainly male political influencers are saying Biden shouldn‚Äôt pick the only woman in their shortlist who dared to compete against him publicly. Unless she‚Äôs super remorseful about it.   How. Did. You. Not. See. The. Sexism?
Establishment Dems (including Biden) condone this with their silence.Only fucking Biden would consider nominating someone named Karen in 2020
Mr. Biden would you please answer the following questions;  1.) Do you believe all Americans should be treated equal?  2.) Do you believe all Americans should be allowed to voice their opinions in public or private?
Service and White House Police Force to expel Trump. He would have no power to stay. If there is an election before 20 Jan and Biden wins then it's the same scenario: Biden is sworn in and has Trump forcibly removed.
Shocking that a Vice President would want to be president ... joe Biden didn‚Äôt want too.... oh wait a minute
You should check out video of your dad (I know the only child he has a personal relationship with is the daughter he wants to sleep with). If I have to choose between Biden and your dad, I have to pick Biden.

Really Dee? The only good thing. Yeah. I'm feeling real good about biden right now! Lol. See you at the polls big mouth.
This bigot is more concerned with bigotry being exposed than with the bigotry itself. He's also spammed a tweet complaining about Biden calling out Trump's racism, but he seems perfectly fine with the fact that Trump's a virulent racist.
But if Biden wins the Presidency, won't he have the authority to have Frump removed?
Oh ok  I thought the reason you wanted to rip down statues of past presidents was because they where racist.    "Trump is the only racist president, there have been past racist candidates, but trump is the only one that was elected"
This is a cartoon by someone who thinks Biden is a Marxist.
Well with Biden in, you gotta go to sleep hoping someone doesn't break into your house because theirs no cops.  And you gotta wake up and see what #blm burned down or who they killed.  Biden will never be #president
So he can repeat 5 words big deal, I would like to see this supposedly Christian man to recite his favorite bible verse, should be easy with his memory, I‚Äôll bet Biden could recite multiple bible versus from memoryTrump and Biden have the exact same military deferment and 1y rating.

Lobbying Intensifies Among V.P. Candidates as Biden‚Äôs Search Nears an End
Two aides to Joe Biden tell CNN that the VP announcement has been pushed back to the week of August 10 and that his personal deadline for a final decision is next week.  In other news: I am tired.
Remember how Joe Biden held up Italy as proof a public health system does not work during the last debate with Sanders? Now look at what works &amp; what does not. The US is looking at an expanding nightmare, millions uninsured, chaos, inefficiency, stupidity.
I‚Äôm a father of two daughters. My heart breaks for you. I will also cast my vote for Joe Biden, in honor of Jaime.
Well I guess it's he said she said.
I guess because it's Joe Biden?
I know perfect candidates don‚Äôt exist, real change doesn‚Äôt happen through politicians, real change happens through protests and movements. Even if Biden or any other candidate were to make some minor reforms, no systemic change would or could happen through the system itself.
Saying Biden will be ‚Äúalmost as bad‚Äù is like saying an apple is almost as bad as cake because they both have sugar. Perfect candidates don‚Äôt exist. Realize that Joe is at least listening to new ideas.
Joe Biden will not shut down ICE, will continue to use ICE to beat up American protestors as well as take immigrant children away from their parents. He will not end the wars. He will not legalize weed. He will not regulate the banks. He will not bam fracking. He will veto MFA.
Biden‚Äôs presidency is gonna be almost as bad as Trump‚Äôs, but because he seems nicer and isn‚Äôt an obvious fascist like Trump, the media won‚Äôt care. A conservative like Biden is better than a fascist like Trump obviously, but I‚Äôm kinda worried people will get comfortable
If you're upset with me for voicing my opinion of Joe Biden, who I think is a sleazebag given his history that you probably haven't even bothered to research, I think YOU'RE sucking on that same thing that you accused me of.
Really? I've always liked black dick myself. I can't help it if YOU don't like TRUE things about Joe Biden. He's been a racist from way back. I WON'T be voting again in this election just like I DIDN'T vote in 2016. Give me better candidates and get rid of the two party system.

Joe Biden will not win. The numbers are fake news. Trump will win in a landslide.
I forreal thought this tweet was about joe biden..........
Oh we will all know on election night! It will be a landslide before any mail in ballots are counted! Biden will be our President not you!
If you want Trump out of office do not vote for Kanye. I feel like Ye‚Äôs sole purpose for this whole campaign is for publicity and to split the black vote between him and Biden. Thats the only way Trump can win this election.
In fact I volunteered many hours of my time to help VoterChoice2020 successfully get a question for ranked choice voting on the ballot in MA this year. I'm working on RI next. But frankly, if we had RCV this year, I still wouldn't vote for Biden. I will never vote for warmongers.

Ah he is playing the old hits tonight #Biden #TrumpIsNotWell #TrumpIsUnwell
Silly  doesn't know the difference  Absentee ballots are cast for Trump by billionaire New York tax evaders with a residence in Florida and are GOOD  Mail-in votes are cast for Biden by normal people who don't like fascism and dying at the polls, and they're BAD
Imagine being so privileged that you think Joe Biden will Fox the damage corps have done to this nation... rich white suburbanite boomers calling the poor seething masses living gpaycheck to paycheck "entitled" is fucking rich
Will Biden announce his VP this weekend?
you and your cronie Jeff Weaver are going against the movement. Not for healthcare, voting as a superdelegate, settling for Biden. What else will you betray us on in 2020?
Biden sounded smoother the other day, than Trump ever has in front of a mic.  You‚Äôre a fucking assclown.

So you must really have an issue with Biden's words as well? Or is Biden different? Are you willing to accept what he says because he's Democrat? Or because he's NOT Trump? How is this any different?
this is the most pressing issue today?  the location of Joe Biden's adult son?  not the economy?  not Russia? not China? not the pandemic?  not your father's mental frailty?
‚ÄúSee Biden‚Äôs doing better than Hilary‚Äù is not a good argument
Pedantic peeps are gonna be pedantic, but he doesn‚Äôt even do that well.  A vote for Biden is not literally a vote for Biden... it‚Äôs literally a vote for an electoral college delegate who intends to vote for Biden... and in some states has the discretion to do that or not.

Lol Trump suggesting election delay is just his way of firing ppl up to disbelieve the results. If he can‚Äôt win at least he can hand Biden an ever more severely fucked up country who doesn‚Äôt believe in election results
I believe VP Biden stayed his number 1 criteria for a running mate is someone he is ‚Äúsimpatico‚Äù with. He has been around politics long enough to know her attack at the debate was political and not personal. Her relationship with Beau may be her biggest draw with him.
Thank you.  Seeing libs tweeting about how this is trump admitting he is weak or losing.   So?!?! That‚Äôs when he does crazy authoritarian things. He‚Äôs cornered. And Biden isn‚Äôt going to save us.
Biden: black parents cannot read and write. Didn't want his kids growing up in a racial jungle. Corn Pop. You ain't black. Pro-segregation anti busing. Obama was clean and well spoken which was storybook for an African American..... Why is any of that acceptable? You don't care?
Joe Biden isn‚Äôt going to save us from this cornered flailing narcissist.
And then compare to Mondale (Biden) and recognize things can get a lot worse.

And a commentary from The Root.
This election won't be decided on November 4th, especially if Biden supporters choose vote by mail. We have to understand that first while we see this play out. It is highly likely that when we go to bed, Trump will be leading, and even more likley that on November 11th he won't

if Biden knew how to fix America why did he wait over 40 yrs in politics to do it.
unlike all those other VPs who had no interest in becoming POTUS. Like, say, Biden. or Bush. or Pence.
I think Warren is gonna be Biden‚Äôs VP and he‚Äôs announcing it on Friday!
You support Biden and he committed to having ‚ÄúBeto‚Äù his anti 2nd amendment czar.
Biden isn‚Äôt banning fraking
I guess that Joe Biden could be in Portland,. Maine and somehow think he was in The State of Oregon.
Joe Biden isn‚Äôt President?
Did VP Joe Biden ever want to be president? Just checking...
She has a recurrence of metastatic pancreatic cancer.  We must vote Biden in &amp; all hold our breaths that she makes it to Jan, so that she can die with peace.
This isn't very meaningful, in other words it's bullshit, until Biden or one of his official proxies starts saying it. You really think this passes as news, dude?
There are black folks who disagrees with Kamala Harris...they will still vote for Biden if she gets VP...  But if she doesn‚Äôt get it after the news coming out like this...those same black folks could stay home and let it fall as it may...
Biden voter of course. I guess these are the "no empathy" people he was chewing for. Isn't it grand.
This is going to be my final poll on this subject. Who will Biden pick? (Not who you want.)
If you like Bernie then Biden is the Complete Opposite....Suddenly after 4 Decades he can fix things....Look at Biden‚Äôs records over those 40 plus years ..he‚Äôs the Epitome of Establishment Washington Politics....and He‚Äôs Hella Creepy.

Screaming and ranting and raving about "Neo-Liberal this... Corporate Democrat that...Joe Biden is evil incarnate... schubeedu.. schubeedu...Trump Closet case in action.." I have no time for him.

Hello Mr. Kaine.  I'll be happy with WHOM EVER  Mr. Biden may choose as his. VP .  I just Want Mr. Biden to..Win in November
are "Biden's allies" also saying, "but ... but ... she's black!"
And there is no chance that Trump will attempt to contest the count, and that Biden‚Äôs popular-vote margin will be important in securing the legitimacy of a win against any such attempts?
I've felt for awhile that the Biden insiders are all in for Susan Rice because she's one of them.
Truly what the hell is happening over at the Biden campaign     This is like sixth or seventh hit piece on Kamala in THREE days. Are we doing the GOPs work for them or? Good god. "Too ambitious" to be VP.
Or is it that you think Joe Biden is LESS racist than Trump? I guess the question is HOW MUCH racism are YOU willing to put up with? Is there a certain LEVEL and Joe Biden meets THAT level? You DON'T mind racism as long as it's NOT Trump and IS a Democrat? Please explain.ü§îü§îü§î
Hmm, so Joe Biden is not racist? Given his history of voting against minority interests his whole time is a politician, and given the things he said about black parents &amp; judging who's black or not just recently, what would you call him?
Trump: We must shoot the anarchists in the street! Biden: No! We must round 'em up and lock 'em up!
If your conscience doesn‚Äôt compel you to stand with the only person with a chance of ousting this lunatic from the White House, you might want to get it checked. I get that Biden isn‚Äôt perfect, but voting is about outcomes, not self-expression.
Still think you have to vote for him to avoid the horrors of a Biden administration? Or is screamingly overt racism a tipping point?
. , you‚Äôre *mini Donnie* now as you are everything you always hated in Daddy. I bet he offered you a big pay off for all the lies &amp; bullshit.   Junior, you continue to say Biden has dementia &amp; is unfit. You‚Äôre confused. It‚Äôs Daddy who has dementia &amp; is unfit.
A Biden midterm means that any Democrat in a swing state begins with a disadvantage. AZ could hold if Kelly has a weak opponent, and if Meadows is the nominee in NC, then I could see a flip. I don't trust them outside of that, though. Not even PA. I know better than to be hopeful
With a uniform swing from 2016, the answer would be 2.7%. Still, I could see a Biden win by up to 4.5% where he only gains PA and MI. WI is moving right and is a tough state.
Yes.. pretty much. it's kind of the same way he answered the question from the reporter... When Biden called him a racist..    .. with more racism.  Trump is a disgusting racist !
Wishful thinking. In a Biden midterm, I think this is what we'll get. (In KS, Bollier won. AZ depends on who Kelly draws for an opponent.)
He wants to position himself for 2024 if biden loses. Much easier to do that holding statewide office and looks like baker will run again
...ass off for your campaign and this is the treatment we get. In the middle of a pandemic, you have the audacity to vote for a platform that doesn‚Äôt include single payer M4A. It‚Äôs a meaningless platform anyway, but you won‚Äôt even withhold your vote for it let alone for Biden...
Well that is not Mrs. Biden
Can‚Äôt possibly imagine a worse ticket than Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine‚Äî   SAYS HOLD MY BEER.   Biden/Harris.   ü§Æ
I‚Äôve been DJing huge covid superspreader parties for 20 somethings, because the Democrats cooked up the virus in Fauci‚Äôs lab just to get people $600 a week for 4 months. &amp; Biden‚Äôs been dead for years, they‚Äôre just splicing old video up, that‚Äôs why he sounds like a scrambled egg
Let‚Äôs put it this way: if Biden‚Äôs running mate has to take his position if his health/body fails... you really want President Kamala Harris? No thank you. At least with  you know that her presidency would be a continuation of President Obama.
Voters voted before a global pandemic, and Biden's plan is designed to leave millions uninsured.  Why dont you just tell them to eat cake Mark
Sleepy?  Bruhhh   sounded just fine yesterday.  You on the other hand, sound like I do after a 12 pack.  Go brush your teeth and pick out a bra for the day.   #Tump #Biden #USA #America #COVID19 #Corona
I wish this were true. But it‚Äôs not. Biden is trying to stop the revolution to protect the elite and ruling class.
Trump called out Beijing for bad trade deals and intellectual-property theft. At the same time that Biden said China was not an issue, and we should be China‚Äôs friend..Biden criticized the president for doing a ban on travel with China. Biden wants to be a friend with our foes.
It was Clinton's and extremely bipartisan. Never said Biden wasn't also racist lmao. The whole lot are. But that crime bill made the war on drugs worse. Didn't create it
I recently described Harris as the Biden for Biden. She‚Äôs the ‚Äúreaching across an isle‚Äù of choices. I get he wants a lady and cop on his side, she‚Äôs the best option. But it‚Äôs just splitting hairs on this whole idea of being a ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù (secretly a conservative that talks good).
Oh  is that really a fight you want to have? Trump vs Biden on respect for people of color?
If there's one thing Biden needs, it's a white centrist Wall Street union-buster..........
Not at all I'm voting for Biden
again?  I told Supreme Commander Biden that we needed to change it every week.  C'mon, do better.
In the meantime Biden answered press questions coherently and FOX News complained that he wasn‚Äôt asked any hard follow up questions.
Main problem with your campaign is we have to come looking for you, you aren‚Äôt broadcasted or shown anywhere. This election needs different candidates other than Biden and Trump.
But Biden won decisively (afterallthecentristsdroppedoutothrowtheirweightbehindcentrism)!
It's overblown is what it is. She explicitly says she's telling people to vote against Trump.  Not to mention I doubt Biden wants her endorsement and the cargo ship of baggage she has along with it.  This is such a dumb thing to hit her on.
Yet more disingenuous meshugas from Chris. It's clear what Biden means are the people causing property damage, not ideologues.
This is very bad. It is perfectly legal and very much protected to be an anarchist. Why are the Dems and Biden so incredibly bad at this? Fascist lite‚Ñ¢Ô∏è is not the place to negotiate to Joe. #Biden #Barr #Fascism
Biden's VP won't be a weak sycophant. She will be Trump‚Äôs worst nightmare.
Libs, do I still have an obligation to vote for Joe Biden after he's said I and many of my comrades belong in jail?
failed. You are so unable to tell the truth that you forget what you said. Dr. Fauci has a brilliant mind. Stop fighting him. Stop making up lies. I realize it is hard for you but please try. We need help and it will be VP Biden.
Biden fully sucks.
Bold move by Biden, attempting to lock down the Marxist-Leninist vote.
Here‚Äôs the good news.  Biden doesn‚Äôt need it.
You probably believe everything cnn, and joe Biden tell you
One of the ways I know the election isn't close rn is that Jerome Corsi isn't flapping his gums about some book filled with fabrications and half-truths about Biden, the way he did in 2016 and 2012.
This is so dumbfounding. We have never had a president who felt he needed protection from the people. This is real tin-pot dictator stuff. Job One for President Biden:  #TearDownThatWall
BREAKING: Joe Biden says he will choose a running mate next week.
Who‚Äôs the front runner to become Joe Biden‚Äôs VP you ask?

I fear the democrats winning in 2020, feeling even more empowered by their ever rightward pull and employing tea party and trump staff in their Harris 2024 campaign. Instead of the Bush/never trump staff that's populating the Biden campaign currently.

So what is Joe Biden‚Äôs plan to stop the fascist militarized police against poor people? To keep weed illegal to imprison more people of color? Tell me more about how we must vote for him.

We need the senate. We already know what #MoscowMitch we do to tie a Biden presidency
Don't worry. Biden is gonna annihilate him. Possibly moreso than Hillary did.
And yet, you endorsed Biden
Biden doesn't have a conviction and y'all still call him a rapist. Only one president had to settle allegations against him only one president had 26 allegations against him for sexual assault. Some against minors. If I was accused 26 times of rape I'm probs a rapist
Too bad  lost sight of everything he ‚Äústands‚Äù for and capitulated to Joe Biden and the Dem establishment
Of course, it's also worth noting the platform is not a binding document and has no actual force of law and D politicians are free to pursue whatever policies they want.  Bigger issue is it means Biden really is personally opposed to the policy.
Let‚Äôs really analyze what this says - a bunch of mainly male political influencers are saying Biden shouldn‚Äôt pick the only woman in their shortlist who dared to compete against him publicly. Unless she‚Äôs super remorseful about it.   How. Did. You. Not. See. The. Sexism?
Establishment Dems (including Biden) condone this with their silence.
The thing about Texas is whether or not Biden *wins* it is out of his hands: it'll all hinge on how badly the GOP fucks up the unemployment &amp; renters/mortgage help and how many people die from their kids being infected at school.  That kind of shit.
Biden would of been all over her leg hair in all
Dodd hates Harris. He likes Warren. And he'll due on this hill for Biden's Veep Committee.
The only people who had breakout performances in the mass debates were Klobuchar and Warren, and it didn't do any good aside from the former probably costing Pete the win in New Hampshire and the latter helping Biden get past the Nevada blowout story.
Hell, a one-on-one with a guy he actually *likes* was his best debate performance of the cycle. The race ended quickly so it didn't matter, but people forget Biden ran away with the one two-man debate.
Yes Joe Biden has many thoughts
Joe Biden won‚Äôt do interviews or debate because he has onset dementia and you still support him ?

By the way everyone, I have the nomination papers for Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker in RI. In case you didn't know,  declined to support any Prez/VP ticket this year, essentially endorsing Biden. So we are instead running under the banner of the Independent Left Party.
All debates should be like last one between Biden &amp; Sanders. Candidates in studio with no audience. Just like Kennedy/Nixon. I've always hated studio audiences at debates.

Another Good Reason For Why Is Biden Picking A Woman For Vice President On August 1st 2020 I Can't Wait!!! #TrumpHatesWomen
Same in Rhode Island. Blue as blue can be. No Biden anywhere.
I mean... she implied Biden was a segregationist based on him ending a bussing policy that was wildly unpopular among his black and white constituents. How can she call that "just politics" and not disavow what she said?
Every punch she lands on Pence could be shaken off as her "playing politics again". Trust is a major theme of the Biden campaign, and she would undercut that message.
Right. We didn‚Äôt see Biden grovel after taking shots at Obama during their primary ... and Obama later chose Biden as a running mate! Come on now.
I have little patience for Vice President Selection Theater, but this really reads like "There's not a white male that the Beltway loves for Biden to pick"
Biden certainly isn‚Äôt doing better....do you actually want a Guy who‚Äôs been in Politics his whole life , already ran and lost twice, has basically got nothing done...nvm he‚Äôs not sure what office he‚Äôs running for

An OPINION piece is not news. Right-wing conspiracies are NOT fact-based.  Try reading the Mueller Report. Every last page is going to be declassified in 2021 by the Biden Administration. That's when things are really going to get fun.

Maybe that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm representative of that group. But I firmly believe it. Biden is the absolutely worst opponent for him. You can see it in his reaction.
Nope. A more younger and more liberal candidate would suffer in many geographic and demographic categories.  Not with me, but I believe that. That is why Biden so quickly rose to the top. People want to beat Trump.
nobody wants to hear this but young joe biden kinda looks like sufjan
You‚Äôre missing the point. Biden is the nominee because he is the guy who can beat Trump. Seniors, suburbanites and moderates are comfortable with him. But his job is to populate his administration with the future.  HRC (who put Trump in office) is not the future.

Yeah I think it's a little different right now given the fact that our species will most likely go extinct as a result.  Biden's climate plan, ambitious as it is, is too little, too late.  There's no time left for incremental progress; it's now or never.
Unless there‚Äôs a redux of Bush v. Gore to stop counting at some point in December. Trump v. Biden, consolidated lawsuits from key states, fast track to SCOTUS.
Let me make this simple for you. Do you think your Biden committed a crime when he told the Ukrainian government to stop investigating his son or he would withhold $1 billion?
That‚Äôs just stories. Joe Biden is a rapist. Obama is a murderer. See. It‚Äôs easy
I hope that Biden finds room for each of them who is not the VP pick in his cabinet.

Lobbying Intensifies Among V.P. Candidates as Biden‚Äôs Search Nears an End
Exactly, which is why I've flipped from Trump to Biden  Decision could not have been easier  Thank you for saying what we are all feeling
Two aides to Joe Biden tell CNN that the VP announcement has been pushed back to the week of August 10 and that his personal deadline for a final decision is next week.  In other news: I am tired.
Remember how Joe Biden held up Italy as proof a public health system does not work during the last debate with Sanders? Now look at what works &amp; what does not. The US is looking at an expanding nightmare, millions uninsured, chaos, inefficiency, stupidity.
I‚Äôm a father of two daughters. My heart breaks for you. I will also cast my vote for Joe Biden, in honor of Jaime.
Well I guess it's he said she said.
I guess because it's Joe Biden?
I know perfect candidates don‚Äôt exist, real change doesn‚Äôt happen through politicians, real change happens through protests and movements. Even if Biden or any other candidate were to make some minor reforms, no systemic change would or could happen through the system itself.
Joe Biden will not shut down ICE, will continue to use ICE to beat up American protestors as well as take immigrant children away from their parents. He will not end the wars. He will not legalize weed. He will not regulate the banks. He will not bam fracking. He will veto MFA.
Biden‚Äôs presidency is gonna be almost as bad as Trump‚Äôs, but because he seems nicer and isn‚Äôt an obvious fascist like Trump, the media won‚Äôt care. A conservative like Biden is better than a fascist like Trump obviously, but I‚Äôm kinda worried people will get comfortable
If you're upset with me for voicing my opinion of Joe Biden, who I think is a sleazebag given his history that you probably haven't even bothered to research, I think YOU'RE sucking on that same thing that you accused me of.
Really? I've always liked black dick myself. I can't help it if YOU don't like TRUE things about Joe Biden. He's been a racist from way back. I WON'T be voting again in this election just like I DIDN'T vote in 2016. Give me better candidates and get rid of the two party system.

In fact I volunteered many hours of my time to help VoterChoice2020 successfully get a question for ranked choice voting on the ballot in MA this year. I'm working on RI next. But frankly, if we had RCV this year, I still wouldn't vote for Biden. I will never vote for warmongers.

Silly  doesn't know the difference  Absentee ballots are cast for Trump by billionaire New York tax evaders with a residence in Florida and are GOOD  Mail-in votes are cast for Biden by normal people who don't like fascism and dying at the polls, and they're BAD
Imagine being so privileged that you think Joe Biden will Fox the damage corps have done to this nation... rich white suburbanite boomers calling the poor seething masses living gpaycheck to paycheck "entitled" is fucking rich
Will Biden announce his VP this weekend?
you and your cronie Jeff Weaver are going against the movement. Not for healthcare, voting as a superdelegate, settling for Biden. What else will you betray us on in 2020?
Biden sounded smoother the other day, than Trump ever has in front of a mic.  You‚Äôre a fucking assclown.
Coming up   tells  she is NOT going to be Joe Biden's Vice Presidential pick.
how right you are look at biden 13 times in th senat          The nn word
Dodd is kind of an asshole, period. The fact that it's on Biden's behalf feels more like coincidence than intentional.
Neither will Biden.
So you must really have an issue with Biden's words as well? Or is Biden different? Are you willing to accept what he says because he's Democrat? Or because he's NOT Trump? How is this any different?
I hear Raimondo and Biden will be meeting early next week.

‚ÄúSee Biden‚Äôs doing better than Hilary‚Äù is not a good argument
Pedantic peeps are gonna be pedantic, but he doesn‚Äôt even do that well.  A vote for Biden is not literally a vote for Biden... it‚Äôs literally a vote for an electoral college delegate who intends to vote for Biden... and in some states has the discretion to do that or not.

Lol Trump suggesting election delay is just his way of firing ppl up to disbelieve the results. If he can‚Äôt win at least he can hand Biden an ever more severely fucked up country who doesn‚Äôt believe in election results
I believe VP Biden stayed his number 1 criteria for a running mate is someone he is ‚Äúsimpatico‚Äù with. He has been around politics long enough to know her attack at the debate was political and not personal. Her relationship with Beau may be her biggest draw with him.
Thank you.  Seeing libs tweeting about how this is trump admitting he is weak or losing.   So?!?! That‚Äôs when he does crazy authoritarian things. He‚Äôs cornered. And Biden isn‚Äôt going to save us.
Biden: black parents cannot read and write. Didn't want his kids growing up in a racial jungle. Corn Pop. You ain't black. Pro-segregation anti busing. Obama was clean and well spoken which was storybook for an African American..... Why is any of that acceptable? You don't care?
Joe Biden isn‚Äôt going to save us from this cornered flailing narcissist.
And then compare to Mondale (Biden) and recognize things can get a lot worse.
If you dont think he's going to fight this to the Supreme Court if Biden wins, you don't know Trump.
... there‚Äôs little reason to believe Trump can win short of massive voter suppression and outright fraud. Those are the real worries, not Biden or some magical Trump turnaround.
And a commentary from The Root.
This election won't be decided on November 4th, especially if Biden supporters choose vote by mail. We have to understand that first while we see this play out. It is highly likely that when we go to bed, Trump will be leading, and even more likley that on November 11th he won't

This isn't very meaningful, in other words it's bullshit, until Biden or one of his official proxies starts saying it. You really think this passes as news, dude?
There are black folks who disagrees with Kamala Harris...they will still vote for Biden if she gets VP...  But if she doesn‚Äôt get it after the news coming out like this...those same black folks could stay home and let it fall as it may...

Hello Mr. Kaine.  I'll be happy with WHOM EVER  Mr. Biden may choose as his. VP .  I just Want Mr. Biden to..Win in November

And there is no chance that Trump will attempt to contest the count, and that Biden‚Äôs popular-vote margin will be important in securing the legitimacy of a win against any such attempts?
I've felt for awhile that the Biden insiders are all in for Susan Rice because she's one of them.
Truly what the hell is happening over at the Biden campaign     This is like sixth or seventh hit piece on Kamala in THREE days. Are we doing the GOPs work for them or? Good god. "Too ambitious" to be VP.
Or is it that you think Joe Biden is LESS racist than Trump? I guess the question is HOW MUCH racism are YOU willing to put up with? Is there a certain LEVEL and Joe Biden meets THAT level? You DON'T mind racism as long as it's NOT Trump and IS a Democrat? Please explain.ü§îü§îü§î
Hmm, so Joe Biden is not racist? Given his history of voting against minority interests his whole time is a politician, and given the things he said about black parents &amp; judging who's black or not just recently, what would you call him?
Trump: We must shoot the anarchists in the street! Biden: No! We must round 'em up and lock 'em up!
If your conscience doesn‚Äôt compel you to stand with the only person with a chance of ousting this lunatic from the White House, you might want to get it checked. I get that Biden isn‚Äôt perfect, but voting is about outcomes, not self-expression.
Still think you have to vote for him to avoid the horrors of a Biden administration? Or is screamingly overt racism a tipping point?
. , you‚Äôre *mini Donnie* now as you are everything you always hated in Daddy. I bet he offered you a big pay off for all the lies &amp; bullshit.   Junior, you continue to say Biden has dementia &amp; is unfit. You‚Äôre confused. It‚Äôs Daddy who has dementia &amp; is unfit.
A Biden midterm means that any Democrat in a swing state begins with a disadvantage. AZ could hold if Kelly has a weak opponent, and if Meadows is the nominee in NC, then I could see a flip. I don't trust them outside of that, though. Not even PA. I know better than to be hopeful
With a uniform swing from 2016, the answer would be 2.7%. Still, I could see a Biden win by up to 4.5% where he only gains PA and MI. WI is moving right and is a tough state.
Yes.. pretty much. it's kind of the same way he answered the question from the reporter... When Biden called him a racist..    .. with more racism.  Trump is a disgusting racist !
Wishful thinking. In a Biden midterm, I think this is what we'll get. (In KS, Bollier won. AZ depends on who Kelly draws for an opponent.)
He wants to position himself for 2024 if biden loses. Much easier to do that holding statewide office and looks like baker will run again
...ass off for your campaign and this is the treatment we get. In the middle of a pandemic, you have the audacity to vote for a platform that doesn‚Äôt include single payer M4A. It‚Äôs a meaningless platform anyway, but you won‚Äôt even withhold your vote for it let alone for Biden...
Well that is not Mrs. Biden

I‚Äôve been DJing huge covid superspreader parties for 20 somethings, because the Democrats cooked up the virus in Fauci‚Äôs lab just to get people $600 a week for 4 months. &amp; Biden‚Äôs been dead for years, they‚Äôre just splicing old video up, that‚Äôs why he sounds like a scrambled egg
Let‚Äôs put it this way: if Biden‚Äôs running mate has to take his position if his health/body fails... you really want President Kamala Harris? No thank you. At least with  you know that her presidency would be a continuation of President Obama.
Voters voted before a global pandemic, and Biden's plan is designed to leave millions uninsured.  Why dont you just tell them to eat cake Mark

I wish this were true. But it‚Äôs not. Biden is trying to stop the revolution to protect the elite and ruling class.
It was Clinton's and extremely bipartisan. Never said Biden wasn't also racist lmao. The whole lot are. But that crime bill made the war on drugs worse. Didn't create it
I recently described Harris as the Biden for Biden. She‚Äôs the ‚Äúreaching across an isle‚Äù of choices. I get he wants a lady and cop on his side, she‚Äôs the best option. But it‚Äôs just splitting hairs on this whole idea of being a ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù (secretly a conservative that talks good).
Oh  is that really a fight you want to have? Trump vs Biden on respect for people of color?
If there's one thing Biden needs, it's a white centrist Wall Street union-buster..........
again?  I told Supreme Commander Biden that we needed to change it every week.  C'mon, do better.
In the meantime Biden answered press questions coherently and FOX News complained that he wasn‚Äôt asked any hard follow up questions.
But Biden won decisively (afterallthecentristsdroppedoutothrowtheirweightbehindcentrism)!
It's overblown is what it is. She explicitly says she's telling people to vote against Trump.  Not to mention I doubt Biden wants her endorsement and the cargo ship of baggage she has along with it.  This is such a dumb thing to hit her on.
Yet more disingenuous meshugas from Chris. It's clear what Biden means are the people causing property damage, not ideologues.
This is very bad. It is perfectly legal and very much protected to be an anarchist. Why are the Dems and Biden so incredibly bad at this? Fascist lite‚Ñ¢Ô∏è is not the place to negotiate to Joe. #Biden #Barr #Fascism

So what is Joe Biden‚Äôs plan to stop the fascist militarized police against poor people? To keep weed illegal to imprison more people of color? Tell me more about how we must vote for him.
The Dems incompetence against Barr *in particular* should terrify everyone much more than Trump does. Barr can execute fascism. Even a Biden victory won‚Äôt neccesarily stop Barr.
Either way, I would have to vote for Biden, while biting my tongue so... At this point I just want to know who he decides on.  This wait is ridiculous!
Maybe he was thinking of Biden from the Onion
Who in the world would be enthused about Biden‚Äîonly his family

We need the senate. We already know what #MoscowMitch we do to tie a Biden presidency
Don't worry. Biden is gonna annihilate him. Possibly moreso than Hillary did.
And yet, you endorsed Biden
Biden doesn't have a conviction and y'all still call him a rapist. Only one president had to settle allegations against him only one president had 26 allegations against him for sexual assault. Some against minors. If I was accused 26 times of rape I'm probs a rapist
Too bad  lost sight of everything he ‚Äústands‚Äù for and capitulated to Joe Biden and the Dem establishment
Of course, it's also worth noting the platform is not a binding document and has no actual force of law and D politicians are free to pursue whatever policies they want.  Bigger issue is it means Biden really is personally opposed to the policy.
Let‚Äôs really analyze what this says - a bunch of mainly male political influencers are saying Biden shouldn‚Äôt pick the only woman in their shortlist who dared to compete against him publicly. Unless she‚Äôs super remorseful about it.   How. Did. You. Not. See. The. Sexism?
Establishment Dems (including Biden) condone this with their silence.
The thing about Texas is whether or not Biden *wins* it is out of his hands: it'll all hinge on how badly the GOP fucks up the unemployment &amp; renters/mortgage help and how many people die from their kids being infected at school.  That kind of shit.
Dodd hates Harris. He likes Warren. And he'll due on this hill for Biden's Veep Committee.
The only people who had breakout performances in the mass debates were Klobuchar and Warren, and it didn't do any good aside from the former probably costing Pete the win in New Hampshire and the latter helping Biden get past the Nevada blowout story.
Hell, a one-on-one with a guy he actually *likes* was his best debate performance of the cycle. The race ended quickly so it didn't matter, but people forget Biden ran away with the one two-man debate.

By the way everyone, I have the nomination papers for Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker in RI. In case you didn't know,  declined to support any Prez/VP ticket this year, essentially endorsing Biden. So we are instead running under the banner of the Independent Left Party.
All debates should be like last one between Biden &amp; Sanders. Candidates in studio with no audience. Just like Kennedy/Nixon. I've always hated studio audiences at debates.

Another Good Reason For Why Is Biden Picking A Woman For Vice President On August 1st 2020 I Can't Wait!!! #TrumpHatesWomen
I mean... she implied Biden was a segregationist based on him ending a bussing policy that was wildly unpopular among his black and white constituents. How can she call that "just politics" and not disavow what she said?
Every punch she lands on Pence could be shaken off as her "playing politics again". Trust is a major theme of the Biden campaign, and she would undercut that message.
Right. We didn‚Äôt see Biden grovel after taking shots at Obama during their primary ... and Obama later chose Biden as a running mate! Come on now.
I have little patience for Vice President Selection Theater, but this really reads like "There's not a white male that the Beltway loves for Biden to pick"
Biden certainly isn‚Äôt doing better....do you actually want a Guy who‚Äôs been in Politics his whole life , already ran and lost twice, has basically got nothing done...nvm he‚Äôs not sure what office he‚Äôs running for

Maybe that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm representative of that group. But I firmly believe it. Biden is the absolutely worst opponent for him. You can see it in his reaction.
Nope. A more younger and more liberal candidate would suffer in many geographic and demographic categories.  Not with me, but I believe that. That is why Biden so quickly rose to the top. People want to beat Trump.
nobody wants to hear this but young joe biden kinda looks like sufjan
You‚Äôre missing the point. Biden is the nominee because he is the guy who can beat Trump. Seniors, suburbanites and moderates are comfortable with him. But his job is to populate his administration with the future.  HRC (who put Trump in office) is not the future.
Biden belongs in a nut house not the White House.

Lobbying Intensifies Among V.P. Candidates as Biden‚Äôs Search Nears an End
Exactly, which is why I've flipped from Trump to Biden  Decision could not have been easier  Thank you for saying what we are all feeling
Two aides to Joe Biden tell CNN that the VP announcement has been pushed back to the week of August 10 and that his personal deadline for a final decision is next week.  In other news: I am tired.
Remember how Joe Biden held up Italy as proof a public health system does not work during the last debate with Sanders? Now look at what works &amp; what does not. The US is looking at an expanding nightmare, millions uninsured, chaos, inefficiency, stupidity.
I‚Äôm a father of two daughters. My heart breaks for you. I will also cast my vote for Joe Biden, in honor of Jaime.
Well I guess it's he said she said.
I guess because it's Joe Biden?
I know perfect candidates don‚Äôt exist, real change doesn‚Äôt happen through politicians, real change happens through protests and movements. Even if Biden or any other candidate were to make some minor reforms, no systemic change would or could happen through the system itself.
Saying Biden will be ‚Äúalmost as bad‚Äù is like saying an apple is almost as bad as cake because they both have sugar. Perfect candidates don‚Äôt exist. Realize that Joe is at least listening to new ideas.
Joe Biden will not shut down ICE, will continue to use ICE to beat up American protestors as well as take immigrant children away from their parents. He will not end the wars. He will not legalize weed. He will not regulate the banks. He will not bam fracking. He will veto MFA.
Biden‚Äôs presidency is gonna be almost as bad as Trump‚Äôs, but because he seems nicer and isn‚Äôt an obvious fascist like Trump, the media won‚Äôt care. A conservative like Biden is better than a fascist like Trump obviously, but I‚Äôm kinda worried people will get comfortable
If you're upset with me for voicing my opinion of Joe Biden, who I think is a sleazebag given his history that you probably haven't even bothered to research, I think YOU'RE sucking on that same thing that you accused me of.
Really? I've always liked black dick myself. I can't help it if YOU don't like TRUE things about Joe Biden. He's been a racist from way back. I WON'T be voting again in this election just like I DIDN'T vote in 2016. Give me better candidates and get rid of the two party system.

Pedantic peeps are gonna be pedantic, but he doesn‚Äôt even do that well.  A vote for Biden is not literally a vote for Biden... it‚Äôs literally a vote for an electoral college delegate who intends to vote for Biden... and in some states has the discretion to do that or not.

Lol Trump suggesting election delay is just his way of firing ppl up to disbelieve the results. If he can‚Äôt win at least he can hand Biden an ever more severely fucked up country who doesn‚Äôt believe in election results
I believe VP Biden stayed his number 1 criteria for a running mate is someone he is ‚Äúsimpatico‚Äù with. He has been around politics long enough to know her attack at the debate was political and not personal. Her relationship with Beau may be her biggest draw with him.
Biden‚Äôs people have spent MONTHS vetting vice-presidential candidates, evaluating their past political and personal dealings, public statements and social media interactions, voting records, friends, family, and much more.   Every one of those things would disqualify Trump.
Thank you.  Seeing libs tweeting about how this is trump admitting he is weak or losing.   So?!?! That‚Äôs when he does crazy authoritarian things. He‚Äôs cornered. And Biden isn‚Äôt going to save us.
Biden: black parents cannot read and write. Didn't want his kids growing up in a racial jungle. Corn Pop. You ain't black. Pro-segregation anti busing. Obama was clean and well spoken which was storybook for an African American..... Why is any of that acceptable? You don't care?
Joe Biden isn‚Äôt going to save us from this cornered flailing narcissist.

And a commentary from The Root.
This election won't be decided on November 4th, especially if Biden supporters choose vote by mail. We have to understand that first while we see this play out. It is highly likely that when we go to bed, Trump will be leading, and even more likley that on November 11th he won't

This isn't very meaningful, in other words it's bullshit, until Biden or one of his official proxies starts saying it. You really think this passes as news, dude?
There are black folks who disagrees with Kamala Harris...they will still vote for Biden if she gets VP...  But if she doesn‚Äôt get it after the news coming out like this...those same black folks could stay home and let it fall as it may...
Biden voter of course. I guess these are the "no empathy" people he was chewing for. Isn't it grand.
This is going to be my final poll on this subject. Who will Biden pick? (Not who you want.)

are "Biden's allies" also saying, "but ... but ... she's black!"
And there is no chance that Trump will attempt to contest the count, and that Biden‚Äôs popular-vote margin will be important in securing the legitimacy of a win against any such attempts?
I've felt for awhile that the Biden insiders are all in for Susan Rice because she's one of them.
Truly what the hell is happening over at the Biden campaign     This is like sixth or seventh hit piece on Kamala in THREE days. Are we doing the GOPs work for them or? Good god. "Too ambitious" to be VP.
Or is it that you think Joe Biden is LESS racist than Trump? I guess the question is HOW MUCH racism are YOU willing to put up with? Is there a certain LEVEL and Joe Biden meets THAT level? You DON'T mind racism as long as it's NOT Trump and IS a Democrat? Please explain.ü§îü§îü§î
Hmm, so Joe Biden is not racist? Given his history of voting against minority interests his whole time is a politician, and given the things he said about black parents &amp; judging who's black or not just recently, what would you call him?
Trump: We must shoot the anarchists in the street! Biden: No! We must round 'em up and lock 'em up!
If your conscience doesn‚Äôt compel you to stand with the only person with a chance of ousting this lunatic from the White House, you might want to get it checked. I get that Biden isn‚Äôt perfect, but voting is about outcomes, not self-expression.
Still think you have to vote for him to avoid the horrors of a Biden administration? Or is screamingly overt racism a tipping point?
. , you‚Äôre *mini Donnie* now as you are everything you always hated in Daddy. I bet he offered you a big pay off for all the lies &amp; bullshit.   Junior, you continue to say Biden has dementia &amp; is unfit. You‚Äôre confused. It‚Äôs Daddy who has dementia &amp; is unfit.
A Biden midterm means that any Democrat in a swing state begins with a disadvantage. AZ could hold if Kelly has a weak opponent, and if Meadows is the nominee in NC, then I could see a flip. I don't trust them outside of that, though. Not even PA. I know better than to be hopeful
With a uniform swing from 2016, the answer would be 2.7%. Still, I could see a Biden win by up to 4.5% where he only gains PA and MI. WI is moving right and is a tough state.
Yes.. pretty much. it's kind of the same way he answered the question from the reporter... When Biden called him a racist..    .. with more racism.  Trump is a disgusting racist !
Wishful thinking. In a Biden midterm, I think this is what we'll get. (In KS, Bollier won. AZ depends on who Kelly draws for an opponent.)
He wants to position himself for 2024 if biden loses. Much easier to do that holding statewide office and looks like baker will run again
...ass off for your campaign and this is the treatment we get. In the middle of a pandemic, you have the audacity to vote for a platform that doesn‚Äôt include single payer M4A. It‚Äôs a meaningless platform anyway, but you won‚Äôt even withhold your vote for it let alone for Biden...
Well that is not Mrs. Biden

I‚Äôve been DJing huge covid superspreader parties for 20 somethings, because the Democrats cooked up the virus in Fauci‚Äôs lab just to get people $600 a week for 4 months. &amp; Biden‚Äôs been dead for years, they‚Äôre just splicing old video up, that‚Äôs why he sounds like a scrambled egg
Let‚Äôs put it this way: if Biden‚Äôs running mate has to take his position if his health/body fails... you really want President Kamala Harris? No thank you. At least with  you know that her presidency would be a continuation of President Obama.
Voters voted before a global pandemic, and Biden's plan is designed to leave millions uninsured.  Why dont you just tell them to eat cake Mark
Sleepy?  Bruhhh   sounded just fine yesterday.  You on the other hand, sound like I do after a 12 pack.  Go brush your teeth and pick out a bra for the day.   #Tump #Biden #USA #America #COVID19 #Corona
I wish this were true. But it‚Äôs not. Biden is trying to stop the revolution to protect the elite and ruling class.
It was Clinton's and extremely bipartisan. Never said Biden wasn't also racist lmao. The whole lot are. But that crime bill made the war on drugs worse. Didn't create it
I recently described Harris as the Biden for Biden. She‚Äôs the ‚Äúreaching across an isle‚Äù of choices. I get he wants a lady and cop on his side, she‚Äôs the best option. But it‚Äôs just splitting hairs on this whole idea of being a ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù (secretly a conservative that talks good).
Oh  is that really a fight you want to have? Trump vs Biden on respect for people of color?
If there's one thing Biden needs, it's a white centrist Wall Street union-buster..........
Not at all I'm voting for Biden
again?  I told Supreme Commander Biden that we needed to change it every week.  C'mon, do better.
In the meantime Biden answered press questions coherently and FOX News complained that he wasn‚Äôt asked any hard follow up questions.
Main problem with your campaign is we have to come looking for you, you aren‚Äôt broadcasted or shown anywhere. This election needs different candidates other than Biden and Trump.
But Biden won decisively (afterallthecentristsdroppedoutothrowtheirweightbehindcentrism)!
It's overblown is what it is. She explicitly says she's telling people to vote against Trump.  Not to mention I doubt Biden wants her endorsement and the cargo ship of baggage she has along with it.  This is such a dumb thing to hit her on.
Yet more disingenuous meshugas from Chris. It's clear what Biden means are the people causing property damage, not ideologues.
This is very bad. It is perfectly legal and very much protected to be an anarchist. Why are the Dems and Biden so incredibly bad at this? Fascist lite‚Ñ¢Ô∏è is not the place to negotiate to Joe. #Biden #Barr #Fascism
Biden's VP won't be a weak sycophant. She will be Trump‚Äôs worst nightmare.
Libs, do I still have an obligation to vote for Joe Biden after he's said I and many of my comrades belong in jail?
failed. You are so unable to tell the truth that you forget what you said. Dr. Fauci has a brilliant mind. Stop fighting him. Stop making up lies. I realize it is hard for you but please try. We need help and it will be VP Biden.
Biden fully sucks.
Bold move by Biden, attempting to lock down the Marxist-Leninist vote.
Here‚Äôs the good news.  Biden doesn‚Äôt need it.
You probably believe everything cnn, and joe Biden tell you
One of the ways I know the election isn't close rn is that Jerome Corsi isn't flapping his gums about some book filled with fabrications and half-truths about Biden, the way he did in 2016 and 2012.

Who‚Äôs the front runner to become Joe Biden‚Äôs VP you ask?
If frontrunner Kamala Harris is named Biden‚Äôs VP pick, Beck Bennett will likely be the only current cast member featured in #SNL‚Äôs Presidential &amp; VP Debates  Based off recent portrayals:  Baldwin (Trump) vs. Sudeikis/Harrelson (Biden)  Bennett (Pence) vs. Rudolph (Harris)
that fucking line about Trump holding the Bible upside down has got me fucking dyyying!  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how often he reads.‚Äù  #Biden #Trump #coronavirus #COVID19 #BarrHearing #BarrTestimony
I fear the democrats winning in 2020, feeling even more empowered by their ever rightward pull and employing tea party and trump staff in their Harris 2024 campaign. Instead of the Bush/never trump staff that's populating the Biden campaign currently.
You don‚Äôt seem to understand what racism means, Joe Biden dog account.
Do you understand this? Because I don't. I hope that it means that Biden wins.
Look folks, time and again ‚Å¶ has been an embarrassment to the party. From booing Hillary Clinton to refusing to endorse Joe Biden. Let‚Äôs send a real Democrat to Congress. Donate to ‚Å¶
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
So what is Joe Biden‚Äôs plan to stop the fascist militarized police against poor people? To keep weed illegal to imprison more people of color? Tell me more about how we must vote for him.
The Dems incompetence against Barr *in particular* should terrify everyone much more than Trump does. Barr can execute fascism. Even a Biden victory won‚Äôt neccesarily stop Barr.
Either way, I would have to vote for Biden, while biting my tongue so... At this point I just want to know who he decides on.  This wait is ridiculous!
Maybe he was thinking of Biden from the Onion
Who in the world would be enthused about Biden‚Äîonly his family
Neoliberals grasping at straws to find a fake excuse instead of admitting that Biden showing his cards in a debate would cause a crushing loss.

We need the senate. We already know what #MoscowMitch we do to tie a Biden presidency
Don't worry. Biden is gonna annihilate him. Possibly moreso than Hillary did.
And yet, you endorsed Biden
Biden doesn't have a conviction and y'all still call him a rapist. Only one president had to settle allegations against him only one president had 26 allegations against him for sexual assault. Some against minors. If I was accused 26 times of rape I'm probs a rapist
Too bad  lost sight of everything he ‚Äústands‚Äù for and capitulated to Joe Biden and the Dem establishment
Of course, it's also worth noting the platform is not a binding document and has no actual force of law and D politicians are free to pursue whatever policies they want.  Bigger issue is it means Biden really is personally opposed to the policy.
Let‚Äôs really analyze what this says - a bunch of mainly male political influencers are saying Biden shouldn‚Äôt pick the only woman in their shortlist who dared to compete against him publicly. Unless she‚Äôs super remorseful about it.   How. Did. You. Not. See. The. Sexism?
Establishment Dems (including Biden) condone this with their silence.
The thing about Texas is whether or not Biden *wins* it is out of his hands: it'll all hinge on how badly the GOP fucks up the unemployment &amp; renters/mortgage help and how many people die from their kids being infected at school.  That kind of shit.
Biden would of been all over her leg hair in all
Dodd hates Harris. He likes Warren. And he'll due on this hill for Biden's Veep Committee.
The only people who had breakout performances in the mass debates were Klobuchar and Warren, and it didn't do any good aside from the former probably costing Pete the win in New Hampshire and the latter helping Biden get past the Nevada blowout story.
Hell, a one-on-one with a guy he actually *likes* was his best debate performance of the cycle. The race ended quickly so it didn't matter, but people forget Biden ran away with the one two-man debate.
Just living for Biden‚Äôs VP pick this week and some sliver of hope I‚Äôm not already just a character in Brazil

I know that Biden isn't an ideal candidate, but I really just wanna stop arguing with my mom for another four years.
By the way everyone, I have the nomination papers for Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker in RI. In case you didn't know,  declined to support any Prez/VP ticket this year, essentially endorsing Biden. So we are instead running under the banner of the Independent Left Party.
All debates should be like last one between Biden &amp; Sanders. Candidates in studio with no audience. Just like Kennedy/Nixon. I've always hated studio audiences at debates.
We will by voting for Joe Biden on Nov 3rd
Biden should pick Demings. Police officer to Chief of Police in a southern city to US Congresswoman. And she rides a Harley Davidson. What could the Republicans do after that?

Oh, you know they are.  I should've returned their lousy $1,200. check that I finally rec'd in June or endorsed it for deposit only and sent it to Biden's Campaign.
Hopefully when Biden is president he mandates that you use punctuation.
All I can think of is Leslie Knope as I read this article.
There's would be a solid partnership and I desperately hope she is Biden's pick. Hopefully they'll announce by this Friday whomever it may end up being. But I'll place my flag firmly that Harris is the best choice for the campaign and for America. End/
To keep that suburbs support firmly in their camp the VP also must reassure them that they are not radical. Harris has distinguished herself from Biden with her earlier attack on him which will be a huge talking point...3/
The attack against Biden by Trump is that he is mentally declining is BS but likely Trump voters I've spoken with believe it, and probably some of his suburbs supporters too. So no matter who the VP nom is they will be forced to combat that narrative...2/
Biden by this point should've picked his running mate and he should've picked Harris. Why? Including her resume she is the best running mate for Biden and she will help get him elected. But it goes deeper...1/
Another Good Reason For Why Is Biden Picking A Woman For Vice President On August 1st 2020 I Can't Wait!!! #TrumpHatesWomen
Same in Rhode Island. Blue as blue can be. No Biden anywhere.
I mean... she implied Biden was a segregationist based on him ending a bussing policy that was wildly unpopular among his black and white constituents. How can she call that "just politics" and not disavow what she said?
Every punch she lands on Pence could be shaken off as her "playing politics again". Trust is a major theme of the Biden campaign, and she would undercut that message.
Right. We didn‚Äôt see Biden grovel after taking shots at Obama during their primary ... and Obama later chose Biden as a running mate! Come on now.
I have little patience for Vice President Selection Theater, but this really reads like "There's not a white male that the Beltway loves for Biden to pick"
Biden certainly isn‚Äôt doing better....do you actually want a Guy who‚Äôs been in Politics his whole life , already ran and lost twice, has basically got nothing done...nvm he‚Äôs not sure what office he‚Äôs running for
The Covid case at those detention centers are high and many doctors that are trying to offer their services are denied entry, kids are dying and trump is hiding those data, only electing Biden we will know the truth

An OPINION piece is not news. Right-wing conspiracies are NOT fact-based.  Try reading the Mueller Report. Every last page is going to be declassified in 2021 by the Biden Administration. That's when things are really going to get fun.

His focus is Biden ...
I can only hope and pray that a majority of Americans see the madness that would devolve if Biden is elected President.  Kiss the USA goodbye if it happens.  SAD!

No joe Biden doesn‚Äôt agree. But I do. Its hilarious. He‚Äôs in full riot gear and the pigs have been firing rounds directly at the heads of unarmed peaceful protestors. This was just a lucky shot. Not the violent malice from the terrorist cops

We deserve a president who engages in the job of representing the best interests of the people.  Trump's failure to do this has resulted in catastrophic death, damage, and destruction to the US, other countries, and the planet. Let's go, President Biden.
So, let's call this a do-over. They're stuck with Cruz but they could replace John Cornyn. And if they go for Biden, icing on the cake.
I think Biden would prefer Kim do it
I never been to Washington DC but I will go when Biden takes the oath to be the 46 president of the USA

Vote Biden.  Because Trump is literally the other fucking option.

Biden is not Bloomberg. He is, however, the Democratic nominee. I think you are trying to make the argument that Biden is not better than Trump while being fully aware of how stupid that argument is

It says he can't be ELECTED president 2X from what I'm reading in the Constitution's 22nd Amendment. So if he's elected vice president, &amp; Biden were to die, or become incapacitated, which is quite likely, does THAT count as being elected? It would PROBABLY have to go to Congress.
Neither. Nice straw man. It‚Äôs also a bad argument to suggest that voting for Bloomberg in 2004 would have been more consistent with voting for Biden in 2020. I voted for Kerry because he was the Democratic nominee
Do you agree with your own? You see my opinion is hate because you don't agree with it. That's how I see yours. What is it that makes you think I have hate? That I don't like Joe Biden? That my viewpoint disagrees with yours? I can be angry about George Floyd but nothing else?
I‚Äôve been very unimpressed by Biden comms to date, especially after  campaign, which was super high quality and well coordinated (one advantage of building a list from zero, no doubt).
Possible benefit of President Biden is that he‚Äôs asphyxiating to centrist pundits. If they‚Äôre not willing to criticize his policies they might have to actually go out into the world to find news
Here are articles in regards to immigrant family members response to Joe Biden and his pot during the Obama Administration and articles during the Obama Administration itself.
Biden won the Democratic nomination. He is the one person who has a shot at beating Trump. If you think Trump isn‚Äôt a big deal, then step aside so the rest of us can do the real work
Why? He isnt going to drill him with any questions the people want to hear, and of course Biden will probably have a teleprompter in the back of Chris Wallace with the answers on it.
I want to know what happened to the diversity of the candidates that it came down to Biden. He was probably the worst out of anybody that ran for the Democrat nomination and definitely the most out of touch. You can't blame the GOP for that.

So much for choice in an election.
The tacit understanding among the voting public that a vote for Joe Biden is, essentially, a vote for some woman that even Democratic primary voters never put in first place in any state to actually be president upon his demise is going to backfire - in a big way.
The Battle for Joe Biden
She's a woman. A Democrat. A governor. And she's still making speculative lists of potential Biden VP candidates:
And... Trump is losing Florida.  You know, because people are dying there because of his failures.
Now imagine Biden without a Teleprompter or his notebook?
That's just a strange thing to say. It admits that Frumpypants's interview went poorly while trying to assert Joe Biden would fumble around &amp; f*ck up as badly, which he wouldn't because no one could perform worse than Frumpypants. Nikki Haley is a weirdo.
I recall the 1988 Dukakis campaign when the word a "competence" was used a lot. Biden is a stronger national candidate by far but it is unclear that theme will be enough to crack the foundation of loyalty we see in Trump voters.
Well considering that our country is CURRENTLY in utter chaos ANYTHING is better. Biden sucks but it‚Äôs better than this low point our country is in. The Republican Party is no longer the party of Bush Jr. it‚Äôs been taken over by Nazis and Russians. AMERICA WANTS TRUMP OUT!!!

Of course you do because you‚Äôre a Biden supporter. Expect no less from a lib.
Biden still needs a plan and a platform to run on.  Trump may be inconsistent and unpredictable but he has the capacity to turn on a dime. Not clear the Biden campaign will be able to keep up with the twists and turns.
The last poll I saw had Biden leading Trump comfortably in total, but, for just white people, Trump was beating Biden 49% to 42%.  So we‚Äôve had 3.5 years to see who Trump is and a plurality of white people say, Yeah, I like him.  Lots of sick white people out there.
Which side is he on boys? This is the Clintonist playbook for 30yrs Bill to Barack to HRC, Pelosi, Biden et. al. Promise them everything, Hope and Change, feel their pain but leave them with it.

No, you have Joe Biden right now. According to him black parents can't read. IF you have any black friends, how many of them are illiterates raising their children?
Funny though, it was okay when Biden sort them out to fulfil his racist cause. I find just as many racists that call themselves Democrats. Many of them are in office.
Or Hillary calling young black men super predators or Biden not wanting his children to grow up in the racial jungle so he pandered to segregationist to stop busing. Stupidity knows no party or ideology.
