But Donnie boy you think there are fine people in the KKK!!!!  You’re the biggest hypocrite and liar. Biden is a devout Catholic. When was the last time you were in a church or prayed????  You sold your soul to the devil 👿
Because the Republicans aren't Real Villains in this story.  The Democrats are created &amp; endorsed by the KKK and Run by racist selfish people. Biden clearly shows how racist he is. I say Really do your research. Trump has his issues but he is straightforward and gets Things Done
I'm really curious why people who are anti-Biden &amp; Trump aren't putting their energy backing Howie Hawkins, who is arguably the best, currently running candidate. And if you're a "he won't win anyways" type person, you just answered why the DNC keeps push out shit candidates.
Apparently the American electorate is so dumb, and American media sources are so inept and corrupt that this election will actually just come down to whether Russia or China has a better propaganda machine. We're all fucking doomed.
I agree , I think Trump maybe has about a 28% chance of winning. It's obvious Mr Biden is a visionary and inspires people with his powerful speeches. Oh, did I mention that Trump only had a 28% chance of defeating Hillary in 2016😂😂😂

Biden &amp; Pelosi accuse Trump of using the Bible as a prop. Maybe he does. But he does understand that nowhere in the Bible does God approve of Abortion, Homosexuality or lawlessness. They both believe that God does approve? What Bible they reading?
It wasn't bait.  I literally restated your position that Biden can't be a practicing Catholic because he isn't calling for Catholic doctrine to become US law.  So, now I'm looking at all the Catholics in government that aren't Catholics.

I agree with that. Its honestly a joke that he could become president. Most powerful person in our country Biden...Jesus
Not liking Biden = supporter of Trump. Gotcha
I been saying it.  This is why Trump has been hoping for Biden as an opponent. He knew Russia had a mountain of dirt and tricks to use on him. And that’s exactly what they’re gonna do.   I hope the Biden campaign actually prepared for this.
Biden is going to prison for treason
Broke: This election is Trump vs. Biden Woke: This election is China vs. Russia
China Biden is only 3 months away from fixing all of China's issues. And Russia knows that Trump will go after them like he is China. He is doing that right now by removing troops from Germany. Big tax money they will lose, but they are replacing it with Russian gas money.
My commitment to you is: I will never apologise for being racist. -Joe Biden
The difference is that China and Iran didn't prop up Biden years ago with funding to a bank that would write him blank checks to pretend he was a successful businessman enabling him to impress the public as a bossman reality TV star so he could make a successful bid for President
Except no one has corroborated the bounties I guess you missed that part. Or the part of that intel that said China/Iran want Biden to win. 🤦‍♂️

Some say that Biden may not debate at all. I'm starting to believe them. Forget about Politics, this guy is way gone. I don't believe he would be able to call a Bingo game much less run the country. I'm not even joking. How can you watch this and say, yeah he could be President.
These are Black Americans that had enough of Joe Biden using racism card to gather Black Americans' votes.

You are not voting for Biden. A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for this guy.
Biden is the product of the reinvented racism of his party stemming from Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society policies. Not as apparent but racist nonetheless.
It will devestate the Dems,less so the REPs. So many see any 3rd choice as a alternative to Biden while also keeping a attachment to the Dem party by not voting for Trump. The Dems know that. Black conservative and those helped by Trump's administration won't budge.

His only goal here was to try to make it seem like Biden messes up the names of places, and Trump couldn’t even get that right. There are no palm trees in Indiana. What an absolute moron.
Well firstly IF he’s not: It’s Kanye’s business model for free press.  He’s not going to pull voters away from Biden. But may draw out undecided voters &amp; andnyounger conservative electorate. Trump &amp; Kanye west have been meeting privately long before this. They’re both savvy
NBC blaming this on Trump or going to give him credit for all the work that his administration has done that give this father the chance to live? And sorry but kids in America are not under anybody's control. This virus may be Trumps downfall, but America's downfall will be Biden

We had better options but just like in 2016, the DNC wanted their candidate &amp; succeeded. We're in the middle of a pandemic with millions more unemployed &amp; without health insurance. And the subject of healthcare for all is MIA. You see the Biden fans talking about that? Nope.
Look no further than Hunter Biden to know what kind of man Joe is
How is he “reaching”? This is as overtly racist as it gets, yet you’re willing to give it a pass because of your manufactured hatred of Trump. If you really hated “racists” you would stand against what Biden says here, not defend it by pointing to Trump. Critical thinking is lost
How was I wrong? Communists have no faith except in Goverment. Which part of Biden’s faith tells him that laws do not need to be followed? Citizens are losing more of their rights. But if you’re happy with that, maybe you’ve just been well trained by the media to accept it.
So maybe they are worried Bernie can still go public and say Biden is a miskate.
It's cool guys, Joe Biden has a black friend.

Jobs added and unemployment drops again and all those who hate Trump are putting a negative spin on it.   How about just rooting for the USA?  If Biden wins I'm still going to root for the USA. If Trump wins I'm still going to root for the USA.
Biden Campaign Cancels Trip Upstairs  via
Another comment Biden and his campaign were forced to clarify. If he keeps this up, his huge lead over the sociopath is going to dwindle. Folks will remember the headline and not the clarification.
Or maybe you should wake up because it’s true the democrat party has turned evil now I don’t think Joe Biden knows it but it’s true
My brother “it’s the people in joe Biden’s camp, I’m voting for”....
BREAKING NEWS  Navy Seal team and Army DeltaForce   Still unable to locate   Joe Biden’s  Politcal2 Legacy  As a Senator or V P   After 40 years all we can find he did was sign his name on his paycheck   only job he had outside of politics was as a lifeguard  He’s a Fruad ◀️
Stop this manufacturing consent. stop it right now. Both Joe Biden and Donald Trump are right wing corporate supremacists who only care for the rich. Progressive will NOT vote for either of them and neither should you. But then you are not a genuine progressive.
I hope Biden let’s the VP pick announce herself before the campaign does.
Following Biden's mea culpa, #CNN, #MSNBC defend former VP after virtually ignoring latest gaffes. #FakeNews
I watched Biden last night and thought I was viewing aTom Shillue impersonation!
🤣🤣😂  Action-Packed “Settle for Biden” Campaign Kicks “JoeMentum” into High Gear - League of Power #Trump2020
“ If Biden wins the presidency, we know Republicans will try to make the recovery as crushingly slow and miserable as possible. As Ryan Cooper notes, Republicans are showing us this right now”
And as I've said repeatedly, I have plenty of issues w/Biden that aren't limited to word gaffes. When he asked the reporter if he was a junkie, was that because he stutters? The list is long. He's lucky his opponent is abhorrent.
Over 300 DNC delegates, members urge Biden to pick Bass for VP  A stone cold "Castro " loving communist !! Fits the Democrat party today !!!
His account is a bot profile. He literally comments  on trump and Biden posts the exact millisecond they are posted. Everyone knows this account is run by a loser nobody
If the president wants to draw a distinction between his and Biden's relationships with God, then he should be prepared to show evidence of his claims.  Call. Him. On. It.
Think I'll take my chances, to me  Trump does care unlike Obama who made a sh*t ton of money off Americans,  and still does. He did give uplifting speaches tho. I'll take the pompous guy who stinks at public speaking, but gets the job done. (Biden Never ever! )thanks 4 relpy😊
No dog for me in the Trump vs Biden fight...just a student of life so I have a question.  If Trump said the exact same thing...would your reaction be different or would you see it the same way?
I know Trump says some DUMB shit. But man, when's the last time Biden said anything that was immediately met with backlash?   We're so fucked in November.
This man doesn’t make any sense. We have to remember trump is a business man, he is one of the best in the world at selling his services/things to people all over the world. Every time he says something bad it gets people to talk about Trump rather then Biden.
The first of many Democrats who now see the handwriting on the wall. Keep everything shutdown and your city will die anyway. And people are not listening anyway. Americans are following Trumps lead, they get out and live life. Democrats/media want to destroy that. Biden hides.
God's super nervous about Biden destroying him, so I could see why it's important to bring these people together.
You doubted they were fake? Now they are PRE editing Biden's words to edit out all his stupid crap before they air him.
occasional mistakes are one thing (Obama said he didn't speak "Austrian" and pronounced the "p" repeatedly when referring to Navy corpsmen...) but systemic loss of memory, time and place is dementia. face it, Biden is incapable of holding office.
Well Joe Biden doesn’t have the power that trump does. Yet.... 😘
Go away, Kanye. You need help.
Biden mispronounces a country name, Fox News &amp; OANN go commercial free for the whole day
and   you are a sellout if you stand with  Latinos have diversity of thought unlike black people who all think alike, says Joe Biden. #BidenIsARacist #BlackLivesMatter

He actually goes to Church, Trump does not.   I bet you Biden can recite the Nicean creed, can Trump?
Funny then that Biden says nothing about keeping churches closed but at the same time supporting abortions. My, what a fine "Christian" to look up to...
Joe Biden, like all Democrats, believe African-Americans exist for their own benefit!
Great thread. Its tough to fathom voting Biden, but I simply cannot deal with the emboldened neonazis, fascists, kkk and this growing qanon cult...I just can't.
Donald Trump blatantly shows you how much of a quack he is, but Biden is MORE OF A QUACK &amp; MORE DANGEROUS BECAUSE HE KNOWS HOW TO HIDE IT FROM THE MAJORITY.
Congratulations to Bradshaw! The money difference in her race is stunning and raises hope for others.   (This further proves Biden did not win a legitimate primary)
He is just an idiot on so many levels, I didn't vote for Obama because he chose Biden. 😩 That is how strongly I feel about Joe, I've paid attention to him for years!
Oh man, i CANT WAIT for the trump v biden debates. it’s gonna be so good.
Now  is on to more harping on Biden and whether inarticulate comment mandates who his VP choice is. Can’t take another half hour
I am under the assumption that Biden is attempting to lose.  I dont believe he wants to br president.  He was only there to beat Bernie.  Democrat establishment WANT Trump.
But what will happen before the election is that ObamaGate &amp; crooked Biden will be exposed. Comey is going down, Yates and others are protecting themselves now. And CNN is still going to be the most inept propaganda machine on tv. How can you be so wrong about everything?
Biden: "I know I just said Black people all think the same, but what I really meant was that they didn't. Because I wanted to say whatever it was that didnt reveal my racism."
Russian bounties. $100,000 per US soldier and Trump is OK with that. Vote Biden &amp; get rid of Trump.
Biden’s 44 year record will Trump(no pun intended) this presidents 44 year career with #blackfolk. He is the lesser of two evils yet you make it out as if  is. I’m a black conservative in  prison bruh, are you? Fight the good fight brutha!
Kasich did not attend National GOP Convention in Cleveland, Ohio - his home state while he was Governor, to thank the 5000K Delegates &amp; families who came to his state/paying for their trips themselves. Such a wee little man.  Conservative Fraud who will vote for Socialism/ Biden?
Joe Biden basically said, " All you niggers are the same" and y'all still wanna vote for him?? SMH
Coming from the guy who is fixated on Biden’s cock in his underwear? You touch yourself to old Joe? 😂😂😂
Compared to Trump, Biden is devout.  Do you go to Church, Jerry?
Joe Biden Clarifies comments he made about comparing African Americans to Monkeys. In his statement he says he wasn't comparing them to those bad monkeys that fling poo but to the good monkeys that don't. This may not have happened but you had to think twice about it didn't you.
Its amazing how America media &amp; the DNC that controls them are doing everything they can to protect China and Iran these days. How much money is China putting in these peoples pockets? We know they own the VP Biden/Obama, NBA, CNN, MSNBC, NBC, CBS &amp; ABC. How many others?

There is a big difference IMO between offensive and racist. People aren’t used to someone talking this bluntly . And majority if not all of these statements were more offensive than racist   Biden said “you are not black if you don’t vote for him”, there are levels

That nigga trump said joe Biden was against God 😭😭😭
Really.. hooking his son up in Poland and China - our enemy would make him a traitor You are as bad off in thinking as Biden- wow.  He was involved in the TREASONOUS attempt to spy on and attempt to take down a sitting President! He should be sitting in jail not a basement!!!
😳 How does a mortal man hurt God? Have you ever seen a more desperate pathetic person?          US election 2020: Trump says opponent Biden will 'hurt God'
Biden meant (but poorly communicated) that the Latino community comes from many different countries, including Mexico, Cuba, Brazil, Guatemala, etc. Black Americans have been here for 100s of years. Trump has also been misrepresented, but more often he means exactly what he says.
Didn't even have to ask the caviar maker for dirt on Joe Biden 👍
On the market.. Biden is expected to choose a running mate soon, and his announcement may cause volatility in the market.. I want you to have expected this.. GM
Only Way I am voting for Biden is  #ninaturnerforVP
Debate Commission Shuts Down Trump Campaign’s Request For An Extra Debate  This is no surprise. They don't want Biden to debate at all.
please watch, retweet and/or favorite this worthy and worthwhile YouTube video: Joe Biden is 'at severe risk of being incapacitated' amid cognitive concerns
please watch, retweet and/or favorite this worthy and worthwhile YouTube video: Joe Biden Insinuates Black People Are All Identical... No This Isn't a Joke
is and always has been a serious RACIST! His campaign staff tweets his apologies 4 him disclosing his racist comments were taken out of context. Joe Biden means what he said! JOE IS A RACIST!
1.8M jobs created in July. Obama &amp; #biden admin sold out Americans by sending jobs overseas. Any1 who thinks #joebiden can create jobs like  needs to wake up!  Text TRUMP to 88022! I stand with
Biden only has 45% approval among Hispanic Americans, Clinton had 66%.
Rumor: Hunter Biden is currently looking for Hillary's 33,000 lost emails and Seth Rich's murderer. 🤠
Biden has "promised" Americans that for decades, all failures.
So Cheddar BOB BIDEN shot himself again yesterday 😂 this is why they don't want to debate, they don't want him to even come outside to walk his dog, just stay in the bunker Biden lol
History shows you are the worst person to talk! If your supporters don't care about grabbing women, credible rape allegations, tens of thousands of lies, Bible photo ops while tear gassing peaceful protests, cheating on 3 wives &amp; paying off a porn star, a Biden gaff means ZERO!
I can only hope that in the debates, Biden brings up something about the bible to which Trump will only be able to have his dumb look -- to prove he is not and never has cared anything about religion. Personally I'm an atheist but it would be funny.
So, Biden says something about the black community being monolithic...  ...and trump's response is that he is no longer worthy of "the Black Vote"   Do I have that right? Or should I have a 3rd cup of coffee?
What happened to Joe Biden?  Nothing.  He's just getting fucking old.  He's old af and he should be sitting on a rocking chair on his front porch.  In no way, shape or form should he be running for President of the United States.
Just talked to some friends about this. I personally can’t stomach voting for biden given his record is an indication of how he’ll govern. However, I completely understand you (and my friend’s) POV. Since I live in SC I’m voting green but also can’t be mad at those voting blue.
Actually, that's what Biden did.   "If you don't vote for me you ain't black"  Stop projecting.
In case you're on fence who2vote4 Cannot get clearer than this...Joe is not a moderate 👇👇👇  Revolutionary Communist Party leader endorses #JoeBiden  #Biden2020  #WalkAwayFromDemocrats  Text TRUMP to 88022! I stand with
It makes more sense if you end the tweet after "Joe Biden has no clue". That sums it up.
Wow, there goes 20 votes to West. This will surely wreck Biden's bid for President.
This is why liberals are delusional. Fredo says TRUMP is ranting and may be impaired!  please check your mirror! Wow, I’m not even sure Chris Cuomo beats Joe Biden in a mental acuity test!
‘Sit down’: Trump buried in mockery and scorn for claiming Biden ‘no longer worthy of the Black Vote’ -
CNA Staff, Aug 6, 2020 / 11:30 pm (CNA).- Vice President Joe Biden on Thursday spoke about his Catholic faith, in response to comments from President Donald Trump that a Biden presidency would “hurt God.” “Like  #CatholicChurch #NewsBriefs #US
Creepy Joe Biden promised he will try to take your Armalite rifles away. That should make you sick!  Hitler and Stalin disarmed their own people.   Your right to keep and bear arms is not for hunting. We all have the right to defend ourselves from a tyrannical government.
What Joe Biden thinks about Black Americans is 'offensive and gross,' says Iraq veteran
I'm confused, I thought Bernie Sanders LOST the Primary...so why is his platform coming out of Joe Biden's mouth?  Looks like the average Democratic Voter got screwed too.  They THOUGHT their vote matter but see, not to their democratic Leadership it didnt...
And whoever the VP might just be smarter than Biden and I'm ok with that. However, VP maybe smarter than Trump and Pence put together; and I'm damn 💯 ok with that!! Least whoever the VP is, they may end up running the country and I'm ok with that!
DARLING THE WORLD NEWS TONIGHT RETWEET YOU POSTED TRASHES YOU AT THE END OF THE CLIP!   ALSO BABY BEST NOT TO SAY BIDEN ISN'T WORTHY OF THE BLACK VOTE    JOE ALWAYS TELLS BLACKS HOW THEY SHOULD VOTE WHICH IS WRONG SO YOU SHOULDN'T EITHER JUST BE CAREFUL BABY
Is #FoxNews and #CNN working together? I heard the Fox anchor mention #Biden was a "practicing #Catholic" when criticizing #Trump for saying Biden didn't believe in God. So I changed the channel to CNN and they said the same thing! Didn't Biden flip-flop of gov't paid #abortions?
Someone told me Montana looks like Joe Biden sniffing Idaho and now I can’t unsee it! #JoeBiden #SleepyJoe #CreepyJoe #Trump2020
Joe Biden clarified his racist comments yesterday by saying he didn't mean to say African Americans are a monolith, Shockingly, he didn't say what he did mean. Of course, the "journalist" didn't press him nor has anyone since
Trump adds jobs, Biden protesters and rioters. Easy choice!
Joe Biden's mental ability is a campaign issue that can't be ignored: Devine  via
No. I'm not voting Biden at all.
Yet another instance of Bidens old school plantation attitude leaking out. Why is Biden so racist?
How do you extrapolate he's trying to spoil Biden's campaign from his statement "walking to win"?
Are we not supposed to notice that Biden’s “clarification” about what he said doesn’t actually include an explanation?
Joe Biden calls out black Americans for not being diverse like Hispanics. Well that would be untrue only if black people would be offended &amp; not vote for this racist idiot. So far I am not seeing much outrage from black Democrats. Joe knows they will vote Democrat no matter what.
Nice job leftist fascists. Hiden RIDEN Biden supporters remain quiet - eyes 👀 closed. Is that somehow plausible deniability 🤔
I wonder how Biden landed that whopper of an endorsement. (Free Golden Corral for life?)
This is rich coming from a lifelong racist who doesn’t know what day of the week it is,and can’t speak three words coherently. You don’t know how to be clear Mr. Biden -
Increasingly confused, Joe Biden continues to struggle.
Did Joe Biden Say He Didn't Want His Kids Growing Up in a 'Racial Jungle'?  #JoeBidenIsARacist , pass it on...
The amount of screw ups Biden is doing while in hiding is impressive. Can you imagine if they let him out?
Susan Rice is the VP Biden needs (Opinion)
This poll is like a Democrats poll. No Democrats are being polled. Because Biden supporters probably aren't following you. Just sayin
You’re still on the Russia nonsense? Seek help. Voting Biden is a vote for the CCP.
It’s interesting that the same people picking apart Trump for his pronunciation of Thailand, don’t seem to notice that Biden can’t complete a sentence.  🤔
#FoxNews just ran another campaign against #PresidentTrump, this time using #RonaldReagan and a video clip where Trump was mocking a reporter (perpetuating the lie that he was deliberately mocking a disabled person). Liar! Trump called #Biden Sleepy Joe; Joe called him a #racist.
You see that stupid Biden commercial about are we better off than we were 4 years ago when everybody knows it's the demon rats pushing and peach ment spreading the virus creating the virus are the reason we're not better off what a bunch of scum
Yeah right....most liberals don’t know how pathetic Biden is because CNN won’t air his gaffes....the debates will ruin Biden
If thats NOT racist, then what is?   has been called racist after his truthful statements were taken out of context, But Biden isn't a racist for this demeaning, self-serving lie that is completely in context?
Biden will NOT be a President, Sir! Trump LANDSLIDE Vote it is! #TRUMPTRAIN2020  #REDLINEUP  #MAGA ❤🙏😇🇵🇭🇺🇸🎆🗽
I guess you're one of the "notable exceptions" that Biden was talking about. Lol
Trump-loving media’s attacks on Joe Biden have all been epic flops so far: data
Trump aides frustrated by his ‘nonsensical’ Biden attacks in Ohio: AP reporter
I don’t understand anyone who would vote for Biden.  I was the same as you in 2016.  Absolutely could not vote for Hillary.
Yes I saw that. For the lady on the ad to blame trump for it to. Like we need to see Joe biden ads on fox. Don't think cnn or msnbc are showing any ads for trump on their channels. So sick of people blaming trump for everything. Fox needs to stop showing liber ads.
If you want  SMART President-it wont be Joe Biden.  Everyone knows he has dementia -every time he talks it's so oblivious he is getting worse!! The Dems know it-wont admit it. Joe Biden's handlers will find a way to get him out of debating President Trump,
Doesn't Kanye have the right to run for President? He is just another choice for people. I tell people, if you don't like Trump and are concerned about Biden and his mental capacity - write in Kanye, even if he is not on your ballot.
Just saw a reprehensible political ad by Dems. First we had blaming Republicans for throwing Grandma off a cliff now we have one blaming Republicans for killing Grandma off with Covid. Sickening!
Why must I vote for Biden? So he can look bad due to Governors and Dem majors that are gay and weak. No Thank you but had enough of the dems already. Dena Titus will get my vote due to her staff, not her, if I dont get a call back about my PUA &amp; an US Army issue I had back in 198
Hey Biden tweet writer; You're trying too hard. At least make an attempt to make it sound like Joe. (fail)
Downside: nothing ever ends  Upside: reminds me that the republican party must be utterly vanquished and the ground of its ideology salted no matter what precise things are wrong with Joe Biden's brain
'Most Deranged I’ve Ever Seen': Critics Rip Trump's 'Desperate' Attack On Biden #SmartNews

"Joe Biden clarifies comments comparing diversity in Latino and Black communities"
We mustn’t get complacent!!!   We have to continue as if Biden is losing!!!! #VoteBiden2020
That young girl who was very anti Trump until that fake Biden story about him sexually harrassment. She went nuts and now has joined the Anti Anti Trump mafia. She is has become a hero to them
I can understand Biden's comment.  The Latino community is very diverse.  The black community is also diverse but not as much as the Latino community because the black community is united by one goal:  to rid the country of white supremacy and black people's shackles.
SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH JOE BIDEN. His cognitive abilities are nonexistent!
Biden fires back at ‘insecure bully’ Trump after president says he ‘hurt God’ -
I agree at this stage of his dementia its not his fault.  My mother had dementia-they have angry outburst, cant remember, talk about things that never happened etc.  Its obvious Joe Biden is getting worse.
IS ANYONE AS OUTRAGED AS I AM THAT 45 IS GOING ON A 4 DAY GOLFING VACATION?? HE REALLY IS JUST THROWING IT IN AMERICA'S FACE THAT HE DOESN'T GIVE A FUCK IF WE DIE, STARVE, ARE UNEMPLOYED OR HOMELESS.. ANYONE WHO DOESN'T SUPPORT BIDEN NEEDS THEIR HEAD EXAMINED... VOTE OUT DJT. 😩
Real fact: Biden doesn't know where he is half the time. Does the DNC really think regular folks are gonna vote for him?
Biden is not even fit to serve his VP pick is irrelevant!
joe biden will not push to amend the constitution when we just make restrictions. ban certain weapons. See how that works. So ya it’s absurd he would push for an amendment change.
I know a few "pox on both their houses" third party voters who could conceivably be convinced to vote Biden.  But I think time and effort is better spent driving turnout among Dems than trying to persuade the lunatic fringe to come back to reality.
"Great minds" think alike. Donald and Kanye thought up this half-baked plan to steal votes from Joe Biden. M orons A re G overning A merica
I would act like I really wanted a debate bad, then trump would refuse. Then when trump wants a debate say it’s too late. Trump does more self harm than Biden could ever inflict on him.
We know this isn’t u tweeting Mr. Biden, Ots clear as day and not sincere.
Republicans push Kanye 2020. But will it really hurt Biden?.  via
I know voting biden is going be a possum screaming on top of garbage. I hate this election and just American politics overall. I wish i felt like i had a better 3rd choice
so basically fuck joe biden
Now do Trump. Also, I agree both Biden and Trump have and can be racist at times. Takes a man to own up to it though.

I am a combat veteran of the Vietnam War and an antiwar activist  Hillary Clinton and now Joe Biden voted for the Iraq war  Globalism entails control by multinational corporations and global banks  The Clintons, Obama and Biden are globalists!  I will not vote for Biden or Trump
Don’t think Biden can beat Trump over COVID-19 response cuz anyone can. All you need to do is just listen to Dr. Tony Fauci and you’ll win slowly and painfully.
Kanye is on my last nerve with his bullshit.
I am still voting for Joe Biden. He will be a great President. He will help bring our country back together again. He will let science dictate how to get this pandemic under control. He will govern us consistently and rationally, and he will rebuild our international alliances.
Biden is a Clinton puppet.
Don't listen to the experts or look at the polls. Vote on November 3rd like Joe Biden is way behind!
Text TRUMP to 88022! I stand with
Trump is a liar.  The Trump Campaign will tell lies every day about Joe Biden.  Resist the lies! Vote for Joe on November 3rd!
Text TRUMP to 88022! I stand with   #biden clearly does not understand guns
Text TRUMP to 88022! I stand with    There needs to be an earlier debate than Sept 29 because 16 states have early voting prior to then.
Can't believe this!   Latino community is diverse, ‘unlike the African American community’  CC:
These people are sick yo. But vote for Biden 😂 they should let Trump send the feds in their and shoot all these people
Seriously? What an arrogant remark! –  Latino community is diverse, ‘unlike the African American community’
You mad cause he grabbed pussy ? How many women be grabbing dicks ? Women also have more sexual partners then men. What about trans women and men ? Trans women grab dick everyday ? You think Biden never grabbed pussy? I mean he fought corn pop he definitely grabbed some that day
Oh yeah, I remember when he stated that latinos are rapists and crimminals... Oh, that wasnt Biden 😬🤔
I don’t care how much you tried to push Biden , “EMPATHY” or “HEART” on  that doesn’t feed my family or pay my mortgage !!
Appreciate that, but it’s all good.   I should have left Biden M4A alone. While I do feel  saying he “promised to veto any” is innaccurate, it is true that he has never supported it/it is not likely to pass with him as pres.   I need to get a better understanding of the $ part
Last paragraph say's "And West was eager to criticize Biden, and expressed comfort with the idea of doing damage to the former vice president’s White House chances. “I’m not denying it; I just told you.”
I agree. There’s no point in a debate. We know that Biden is the only choice. I’m not worried about losing, Joe would crush him. Donnie boy won’t answer any question straight up so what’s the point of a debate
What racist comment from  #Biden        #Trump2020Landslide #TrumpThreatensAmerica
Did this mf just say we all the same? Except for a few notable exceptions? Fuck u Joe Biden
Joe Biden will never stop fighting for people of color and never stop listening? 8 YEARS in office as V.P. to a black president and neither of these bozo's did anything of substance, during that time frame, to make substantial changes for the Black community. COME ON MAN!
ALL GLORY TO GOD for your strength and intelligence AND Biden’s STUPIDITY!!! Good will definitely prevail in November 🇺🇸
Are you trying counter Poor old Biden’s daily gaffes?
Maybe you aren’t reading the tweets, he made the joke, I just responded. I know you are blinded by your hate, but Trump is gonna lose. Forget my opinion. Biden is a 2/1 favorite on the largest betting xchange in the world. Better than my or your opinion.
Biden has a plan because he isnt an unqualified bafoon.
Biden: Unlike African-Americans, Latinos Are 'Diverse'
Joe Biden will never debate President Trump! The libs are going to make every excuse in the book! Liberals are the biggest liars in America!
"What you all know but most people don't know, unlike the African American community with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things"-    Gentleman, Joe fucking Biden for you.
Who’s going to be Biden’s pick this week for president 😂😂😂
Tweet my on November 4th, I’ll be happy to admit I was wrong if Biden loses. Trump has lost so much support I do no believe Biden can lose.
I wasn’t trying to get him off the hook. You said he “Promised to Veto M4A”.  I assumed you had a source, I was wrong. It’s funny that you guys say we shouldn’t look for an actual quote after putting words in his mouth.   I know it’s hard for you to accept, but Biden wins easily.
We plan to do just that on November 3. Then we’ll have to fumigate the White House before a real president moves in.   We’ll get the limos, helos and air force one steam cleaned. Then President Biden can strat to rescind all the idiotic things you’ve done. Along with arresting u.
You're absolutely right, the things that Joe Biden says are inexcusable.
Well she's Latina no better race to recruit Latin voters. A lot of people have had a change of heart shows how despicable Trump is.  Symone Sanders former Bernie Sanders spokesperson is an advisor/spokesperson for Biden today. People change necessitated by new circumstances.
Well that’s the most ignorant thing I’ve ever heard. What if you don’t like his VP?  You going to vote for trump?  Who put the most unqualified person he could find in every important position in his administration!  Do us a favor. If you don’t vote for Biden, don’t vote at all!
I’m not a Dem. I’m not afraid of losing. I am quite confident Biden wins easy even though I’m not a huge supporter.   I do feel that HONEST debate is important. Biden never ran on M4A so no he’s not likely to pass it. Clearly Trump won’t either so suggesting he would is crazy.
No one saying they will leave if Biden wins tho 🤣
And if you don't vote for Biden you aint a non-diverse black person
So Sabrina says “Biden has Promised to Veto M4A” and then you suggest I am barking up the wrong tree when I ask fir prof of the promise. Lol.   Maybe, just maybe, if there aren’t clear and direct quotes we shouldn’t represent that a specific promise exists. Wasn’t my statement.
Biden has as many gaffs now as China does people!!!
Nicely said by Biden!!!
Both have a very sketchy history of being racist.
Susan Rice is the VP Biden needs (Opinion) - CNN
People are so tired of you #45 that, they don’t need a debate between you and VP Joe Biden, they just want to get rid of your ass!! They only one ready to cheat, lie and steal this Presidential race is you because that’s the only way you will win!!
Please, first of if you do not understand the complexities at age 77 when will you, second Biden has been fighting for racism over 40 years. They are both junk candidates out of time and during this critical time, we would need something better than this. The Arctic had 100 F 🙄
Biden sucks
I just was put into twitter jail for calling Joe Biden a lying racist pedophile asshole!
Me? Stop pretending he did.   I supplied the EXACT QUOTE. It absolutely does NOT say that.   You can twist it as much as you want.   In fairness to Biden he didn’t run on M4A. The question itself is reduculous without more info like how it’s gonna be paid for.
You better vote for him. I already told you to stop being ridiculous. Biden has always made gaffes. Big deal.
Ok we get it by now. Biden is🗑️. Trump is💩. But all I see is criticism. Nobody ever mentions legit alternatives.  Howie Hawkins. Jo Jorgensen.  Duopoly won't just disappear. That convo needs to happen. I'd be at peace if I felt US voters voted based on confidence, not fear.
Do what you gotta do. Trump is awful. But don’t look me in the eye and act like Biden is even remotely a good person or candidate. Lets not kid ourselves.
Sir, the fact alone that you defend  that we even talk about this, is insane.  lies, that's it. Done.  So tmr when he claims the sun will never shine again if Biden is elected, do we need a commission and sientists and some research to prove him wrong??
Corn Pop made me say it!   Joe Biden clarifies comments comparing diversity in Latino and African American communities
I don’t think he is listening to his Black staffers. Although Biden has and continues to apologize, he still makes these “Archie Bunker” like racist comments.  He didn’t think he ever did anything wrong. He had Chris Dodd, Ed Rendell and Larry Summers as advisors. Says it all
Yeah.  I still cant stand Biden with Barbara Lee next to him.  Besides, if you are on the VP list, then you have already sold out behind the scenes.  If Lee was selected, that would be a stain on her.
Yeah but but but IT IS JUST NOT TRUE. Other than that it’s slll good.  Don’t vote for Biden if you don’t want to, but suggesting Trump is better for health care is pretty reduculous.
If he said it show me because I can’t find it.   What Biden says when asked was "I would veto anything that delays providing the security and the certainty of health care being available now," full quote below.
It wasn't Biden standing in front of a Church with the Bible Cross upside down. That gesture indicates Satan.
Instead of covering for Biden, we to get on his damn campaign to fix the candidate.  Biden is a disaster.
Well thats something made up! How is it? That he put African Americans to work, when Biden and Obama unemployed them for 2 terms, For illegals to work! And also left them homeless.
I dont hate Rice.  Dont know much about her other than she has Pelosi's support (which makes me wary).  I do despise Biden however.  He is my enemy and no VP is going to change that.
Mr. Biden (your trolls) don’t have the right to lecture WE THE PEOPLE on our VOTING RIGHTS! You (your trolls) are nothing but LIARS &amp; EVIL!
Lol so you brought up trump why? Fake news. Joe biden is a pedo
Still better than Biden in a way.  Cant veto #MedicareForAll
Biden is just the lesser of 2 evils. That is 21st century politics.
#BernieSanders calls on #JoeBiden to debate healthcare. Why does Biden think America cannot guarantee healthcare to all citizens? #BernieJoeDebate2020
I don't know much about Kanye West except that people in the comments say he has mental problems. So, it appears that one deranged mind is trying to help another. But anybody who votes for West is not taking the election process seriously. Everything is at stake Nov. 3! Biden 💪!
Biden raises eyebrows with remark contrasting African American, Latino diversity
To be honest, Im not voting for Biden if he selects Rice either.  I cant imagine any VP that would motivate me to vote for him because it wont change his values.
Biden faces backlash for comparing diversity in African American, Latino communities President Trump seized on the comments as "a very insulting statement."
Decided to stalk me huh? Can’t get enough.   Biden may say something racist “on accident”, but Trump will say something racist on purpose. Again. And his supporters will eat it up. Again.
If we don’t get Biden in by next January, this country will crash and burn.
Retard olympics with him and Biden. That’s the 2 best we got lol

Extraordinary!  Very, very well done.  VP Biden has handled this perfectly.
Lol like do you really think that we believe this is Joe Biden tweeting and not his intern? 😆
I absolutely agree, Biden's dementia will force him out of office before 2024 or the strain of the Presidency will force him out. Whoever is Vice President will rise to be the President before 2024, no doubt.Biden cannot form a sentence right now, and it's going to worse everyday
For all my new followers, if you like telling people that they have to vote for Biden because of trump, you're not going to have a good time here. Might want to see yourself out.
You are 100% correct.  Biden was terrible during the Democratic primary debates.  Every interview he made during the pandemic he’s a major offensive and it’s usually against the same Black people that saved his ass in South Carolina.
So for everyone being too negative about it: you're either voting for Biden or you're voting for Trump. And everything in between is a vote for Trump. I'm disheartened by the people who say they won't volunteer or donate if their VP pick isn't chosen. Grow up. 🤦‍♂️
It’s more people than Biden got at his rallies.
Just saw the Biden interview &amp; holy cringe, how did Bernie or Warren not beat this guy? 🤦🏼‍♂️
What gets me is this trends and #TwitterMob #Twits lose their minds but  saying African Americans are not as diverse as Hispanics is perfectly fine. 🙄🤦 #Hypocrisy #SocialismisaMentalDisorder #WalkAwayFromDemocrats
If Biden wins can we all come over to y'all's state? Please...

I know. Why can't folks accept ANY criticism of a candidate? He also asked the reporter if he was a junkie bc he (Biden) didn't like being asked if he would take that cognitive test. Biden is not a good candidate but I'm forced to vote for him bc the alternative is an archon.

That's exactly what he's doing and he even admitted it. Voting for Biden.
In the several polls conducted that include Kanye, they showed siphoning votes from Trump - not Biden. It’s almost like Biden voters are just smarter across the board. Hopefully this doesn’t insult any of the mouthbreathing, toothless Trump supporters.

Liar. You're in it to help your buddy Trump.

Liberals &amp; Lame Stream Media accuse Trump of being racist but it’s you, Joe Biden, who is the real racist. You’ve said racial comments throughout your entire career, yet democrats are too naive to call you out....   You’re borderline retarded so they’ll continue to protect you.
No wonder you love trump...you're a con man just like him.

Joe Biden Is No 'Ally' to The Black Community  via  #BidenHarris2020

Now he’s even saying the quiet part out loud. I’m trying to tell ya.
Biden knows when he makes a mistake and apologizes for his words! It take a good man to do that! I respect that greatly!
Biden right. Because that's what you just said. Remember BIDEN is the Corporate Pawn. So you are all going to vote someone else OR not vote at all.After seeing all three, i have to ask when Joe Biden became an eldritch horror?
China, Iran, if you’re listening ... US intelligence accuses Russia, China and Iran of election meddling – live
This is precisely what Biden, in his usual blundering Bidenistic way, was trying to say yesterday. Black Americans share much more of a common ancestry through the institution of slavery; Hispanic Americans emigrated under a bunch of different cultures and circumstances.
This is a good hire.  is certainly more conservative than I am, but Florida is full of conservative and centrist Latinos who fled Communist regimes. Her advice on how to reach these voters will be indispensable.
Right? Biden could end up winning this by hanging out in his basement.
Democrats will certainly lose seats in 2022 if Biden wins, but it's not going to be as bad as 2010 was. That majority was built mainly with rural seats trending away from Democrats; this one was built with suburban seats trending towards them.
How many underground basement levels does the White House have? Will Biden be able to change them daily and think he’s in a new White House each day?
I blocked this woman months ago. I hated how she bashed Bernie then thanked him for dropping out and falsely proclaimed unity with Biden. Can’t stand her fake bs

I'll be fine with either one, and I understand the appeal of Rice from Biden's perspective, but I still think Harris is a clearly better choice.
Ok. Do you believe tRump? I think it is now documented that he has lied to US (you know, the U.S.) over 20000 times, since he took office. Pretty classy move on sleepy Joe’s part; but tRump said god needs protecting from Biden?!? I’ll wait for your input...

Do you remember when you and the DEMS where hostile about the early actions of Trump including the travel ban. Biden called it xenophobic. I remember.
He'll also suddenly start caring about the Hatch Act because some low-level intern at Biden's White House says something vague that can be construed as critical of the Republican Party.
People that don’t travel or relates to Latinos won’t understand it but Latinos come from different countries with different accents and ways of thinking. Biden is right. ..Biden seeks to clarify comment that Latino community is diverse, 'unlike the African American community'
Spare us the false outrage with Biden.   Perhaps ‘Tiff’ can write a thesis on Trump’s entire life of racism, bigotry, and anti-Semitism. His entire orbit includes those sporting their “ok” sign language. Give us a break.
Exactly. Biden could be terrible. But Trump is a danger to the Republic. It's as Joe says....do you want FOUR MORE YEARS of THIS?!

Joe Biden and the liberal Democrats are going to try to cancel Christmas, they have for years, Trump brought the greatness of Christmas back, we have to protect Christmas and America, Re-elect President Donald J. Trump
It isn’t a binary choice though. Trump doesn’t have to be less racist, just to make Joe look racist enough to either suppress voter turnout like he and Russia did in 2016 or detour voters from Biden to Kanye as they did with Johnson and Stein in 2016.
If you show the proof that he owns it instead of "ive read it somewhere" then this things become factual. I reas its a US governemt property and James Biden owns a part of un developed land with nothing built on it.
Hiden Biden is against God, he's pro abortion, pro close churches down he wants to change the evangelical Christian lifestyle by shutting down through covid.
If I had my choice for  running mate it would be  But I honestly DGAF. Biden could choose the corpse of Fidel Castro and his campaign would still be less Kremliny and more patriotic than the Putin owned  and Saudi owned  ticket.
Joe Biden's either too dumb to think about his comments before saying them or he's a closet racist either way he is nowhere near fit to be leader of the free world!
Biden not worthy of Black vote Latino vote any vote!!! VIVA TRUMP!
After Joe Biden's stunning admission that all black people are basically the same and not diverse at all He's either a closet racist or he's too stupid to think before he speaks. And yet there will still be many people that will vote for him.
It's only one or the other,, either Joe Biden is a closet racist because he thinks all black people are the same or he's too damn dumb to articulate what he means and it comes out as his weird broken gibberish!
Joe Biden is still a racist.   Nancy Pelosi is a constant drunk.  Chuck Schumer is a whiny bitch.   Kamala Harris is still one of the worst AG's ever, and now plastic face.   Karen Bass, Elizabeth Warren, &amp; Bernie Sanders are communist.
This further illustrates that either Joe Biden is a racist and thinks all black people are alike or he has no damn idea what he says,, he just says the first thing that pops into his mind!
That's like the biggest mystery of the 20th century is how someone of sound mind can listen to Biden talk and say wow that's who I want to be the next leader of the free world lol

Biden dying? Maybe? A girl can dream anyway.
If Biden wins and accomplished nothing else than eradicating Trumpalo corruption from the Federal government and making our economy, foreign affairs, and the ACA functional again he will be a success. If he works with congress to prevent another Barr and Trump, he’ll be great.
And this is the same man that eulogized Robert Byrd, a registered member of the KKK. Biden hates blacks. Black Americans need to wake up. He's no friend of yours.
WHAT DO YOU THINK? The Biden campaign has launched a new national ad focused on Black Americans, urging them to stand up to President Trump the way their ancestors stood up to "violent racists of a generation ago."
Yep. And the topline definitely matters in this race. Biden is going to blow out this district. Plus, Dems lead +9 on GCB.  Garcia needs Collin Peterson levels of ticket splitting to make this work.
This is one of the worse cases of Elder abuse I have ever seen. Everyone of us should be calling Senior Services to go and check on Biden’s Care. We have a law that anyone who believes an elderly person is in danger has a duly to all the police and have them go out and check.

Hey Ronna:  Beijing Biden wants Open Borders.   The Socialists want millions more illegal aliens coming into our country.   And they want to give them Entitlements that will negatively Impact Social Security.  All should see this train coming.   MJ
Biden can’t make Trump look like a bigger fool than he already does but he runs the risk of making gaffs that give the media a reason to create a close horse race for better ratings. There is no upside for Biden to debate. He already looks and acts presidential. Trump is losing.
Lindsey Graham can't ruffle Yates 💪😇Yates says Obama, Biden didn’t influence Flynn investigation
I think Biden shouldn't even be put on a ballet for he stuttered so many words just saying mental fitness or mental health. He couldn't even say that with out stuttering or his sentence broken up. I say Biden should go in and get tested for dementia or whatever the doctors say.
She wouldn’t do Biden any favors either. She faced a lot of criticism due to her inept handling of the Atlanta riots. 10/1 days he’ll pick Susan Rice.
Funny thing. Biden hasn’t had his health records available since before he became VP. Biden had two brain aneurysms in 1988, the first of which almost killed him.
there is nothing anyone can do to make biden progressive
“Well, if he can’t figure out the difference between an elephant and a lion, I don’t know what the hell he’s talking about,” said Biden - Huh?  Re: cognitive test question: ‘Why the hell would I take a test?'  via  #Politics #Biden #Trump
I think Hillary will do better in the popular vote, at least by the margin between trump. Hillary has, if anything, the chance of being the first woman president. Biden doesn’t have anything like that.
The Biden handlers and DEMS know that gun sales are way up this year. It is estimated that 80 million people bought a gun for the first time. Could it be that the violent protests and clashes with the police have reminded Americans how important the 2A is?

So not only is  illegitimately employed in violation of the FVRA, hanging Chad is corrupt AF too. Dude is going to have a very unpleasant 2021 of Biden is elected and his AG decides to clean up all of the Kremliny corruption perpetrated against America by Trump fluffers.
Hey we have a very important announcement from the White House today Joe Biden announced that he’s going to stage a coup on the oval office he had entered bathroom....never mind it’s a poo not a coup.
He brought...? He did nothing and, luckily that was wiser than doing something. I'll give you Bin Laden. Of course, Biden was dead set against it but you're going to vote for him anyway...right?
And 80% of Biden delegates felt disrespected by the socialist party. Both of them are greatly disrespected by republican delegates. The point, the issue has been decided. Had Sanders won I would have been pissed as hell. But I would have eventually gotten over it.
I cannot wait for a debate! Trump will bring is his charts and graphs, point to them, ramble about how great everything is, make false claims about voting by mail...and this will all happen before he's even introduced!  Biden just needs to wait out his stupidity.
The selection by location is done with strategery, is WI still in play, or are there polls on the QT that show a Trump win.  Are they repositioning resources, or is Biden that far downgraded?

I feel Biden should be given a test to see he has dementia or not and then release information to media tv and doctors and the CDC make it unedited all doctors notes no black out lines and once released Biden wife should be ask some questions in front of Congress

Joe Biden is pushing back at Republican assertions that he should take a cognitive test to disprove President Donald Trump's claim that the Democrat isn't fit for the Oval Office.
If a person voted in person for Joe Biden, Trump would claim fraud. He's determined to stay President with any means available. Even suing states for mail in ballots which are perfectly safe and legal.
Then vote for Biden!!!

a lot of people do. on the other hand, Biden doesn’t know where a Yo-semite is or where California is, either.
they still haven't courted anyone but those who were already for Biden during the primaries. It's the very same hubris that got us here in 2016 and if they lose, they'll blame Sanders supporters again.   No question.
All these polls touting Biden ahead of Trump are not considering the fact that so many  supporters will not vote for either, again splitting the vote and giving us Trump. Don’t get complacent! #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #VoteBlueNoMatterWho2020 #VoteBiden #Vote2020

I think their point is: imagine if for every state that’s close we have to wait 6 weeks for closure. Instead of watching for 6 hours to see who won each state, you wait a week for maybe Trump to win in x state but Biden winning in y. It’s improbable.
Bernie Sanders won overwhelming majorities of Latinx, LGBT, Asian Americans, younger black voters and indigenous peoples. More women supported Bernie than supported Biden.    Some peak shit is dressing up the 75% of Biden voters who are white cisgender and heterosexual as diverse

In a way, I am for Kamala Harris is on the Biden VP pick. Pence needs on-air persecution for all the crimes done by the Trump administration. I do not believe Pence would fair well against an ex-California Attorney general and San Francisco prosecutor.
He was part of a good team with Obama and helped our country recover through those years. Dow was at 8000 when the team took over and handed it off at over 19,000.  Either way, we may, or may not, find out. Versus Trump, I'll take my chances with Biden. Would LOVE Jorgensen tho
If you've seen any of Biden's speeches in the last month, you'd see someone who's going to clobber trump in the debates.  Puppet? Trump kissed Putin's ass onstage for all the world to see, but trump supporters generally switch to "ignore" and call it "fake news".

I’m voting for Biden still! Get the non competent republicans out of office. They are literally killing Americans.

Joe Biden himself clearly and transparently had presidential ambitions when he joined Obama's ticket. No one ever thought that was an issue, and indeed it wasn't; Biden was consistently loyal and advanced Obama's policies.  So why is it an issue for Kamala Harris?
Biden stumbled on  yesterday- incoherent, read from notes, lost his place, etc. He took 6 days to produce a 20 minute podcast! Biden is the luckiest worst candidate ever! #settleforjoe
I like to start with Joe Biden. When he said he would take POTUS out behind the school I wanted to take President Trumps place. Told Biden the President is kinda busy but I’m a 70+ year old Marine Veteran 100% disabled, pick your parking lot and see who gets back in their car.
That gives me hope. We are between Reno and Incline and most of my neighbor it’s are Bay Area transplants. There are lots of stay at home mom’s that I can tell are Biden supporters but their husbands may not be. I haven’t quite pinned it down yet.
Interesting! I am right outside Incline and although I do not see any signs at all I can tell most of my neighbors will be Biden voters.

Why vote for Trumpy.  We all know that Obamacare has produced millions of jobs,  especially in the virus age which we are in Vote Biden. What do you have to lose?  Trumpy's plan is massive jobs lost &amp; no health care for millions. They want to cut seniors out of the system as well
Another FAILED PROMISE of Trumpy's Regime. The first 100 days of his administration in 2017. Two weeks ago yesterday All bullshit like him  Lying of course because he hasn't got a better plan than Obamacare. Vote Biden to improve Obamacare in the virus age
I almost hope they do pick Elizabeth Warren so all the people that demand Joe Biden pick someone who is black just freak out!!
The Democrats are already saying don't do the debates because they don't supposedly want to give Trump any media attention to tell another lie  lol,,,when anybody clearly knows that simply to give Joe Biden an excuse not to do any debates!!

Have “Biden” embroidered across the front and wear it with pride.
Trump is losing a key battleground state because voters aren’t buying his Biden smears... this guy probably believes him
We did the same driving from Las Vegas to Reno. Trump 100’s Biden -0-
Then please tell the media to stop writing shit articles that Bernie voters don’t give to Biden. We aren’t donating to him because he is shit. Get over it. He’s got 107 billionaire donors anyway, why the fuck does he need our $?
Mr. President have Biden take the test to see if is suffering from deminitia and have his test results sent out to the media
More reason to vote Biden Blue and all down the ticket Blue too.
We can only hope since we might end up with a senile hair sniffer like Biden.
DEMS won’t be running Biden. Switch-up at convention.
hahahaha, you are such an idiot.  We have you pegged, blame Biden for what Trump is doing.  We the PEOPLE, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice...will VOTE TRUMP OUT Nov.3rd.  Quit lying to the gullible people of America, you are not American
It’s not because of Joe Biden that he’ll go to jail. It’s because of him 😬he did it to himself
I am willing to bet anyone 1k that Biden.
Joe Biden has been running against no one for far too long. It was a mistake to give the primary to him uncontested.
They are trying to convince everyone if he is ahead in the polls, hollow Biden can set conditions for the debates that Trump would never agree to.  Then storm out and say no debates due to Trump.
In this case, it's likely Biden's VP will be the top candidate in 2024. Being VP will be a big boost. I also think Biden will rely on the VP as Obama did with him.
Well hello! “They” were never going to nominate Biden. New nominee will be “picked” at convention.
The truth does not exist in Trump's world  #2020Election #Trump #Biden #Incompetence #Leadership #FilureToLead #Unfit

Wonder why nobody is investigating Biden's son
Hey James:  Everybody knows that Kamela Harris slept her way into California politics.  She was Willie Brown’s mistress.  Brown controlled the state legislature for years.  Wonder if that came up in Biden’s vetting.  Had to since it is common knowledge.  Suspect Kami is DOA. MJ

The answer looks like it will be yes until you see Biden is the alternative so it's a big fat NO.

Biden was Vice President for 8 years, making him a political man, and we’ve seen his tax returns, how come the “man among men” can’t show his?

Lol, pathetic.  Trump is the worst speaker, worst leader and bragged about “acing” a dementia test.  Biden has 100 times more cognitive function on his worst day than Trump has on his best.  There is no comparison.

You certInly can’t be that blind, The Biden’s are corrupt, all of them... wake up!
Hey Biden!!
I hope someday you can see how supporting Biden just because you are filled with hate isn’t healthy.
So you think Biden is incompetent. Gotcha. #TDS to the max.
You have tried three times and failed three times. I asked without mentioning Trump tell me what good Biden has done. You didn’t even mention Biden. You have tds.
Like a typical Biden supporter you can’t comprehend or simply are incapable of correctly answering a question. I said without mentioning Trump. You couldn’t even make it 3 words. You have nothing positive to say about Biden. Nobody does. Care to try one more time?
Answer me this. Without mentioning Trump, why should anyone vote for Biden? What has he done to be worthy of being president?
Hitler’s brain was still more intact in 1946 than Biden’s is right now.
Our republic has seen worse, believe it or not. We went from Obama to Trump. Literally blacks to deplorable’s (trailer trash/white supremests). What is not considered are the effects of globalization, automation and changing demographics. A centerest like Biden is exactly need.
If people have not realized that Nancy Pelosi is a drunk or a stumbling moron like Joe Biden then something's wrong they're just not watching TV!
Only thing I see is the trump administration tryna turn black and brown ties with this propaganda video......so basically the message is Biden don’t deserve the Latin vote cause he may choose a black woman vp.
Alter our Nation he will have us all in encampments.and gassed...what he would call the lower class citizen. Keeping his big Corporate Assholes! I am voting for you Joe Biden/running mate you choose. No ? No doubt about it...✌❤👍
It’s a Chinese app which means the state government of China has unfettered access to ALL its data. Exactly the reason that the Biden campaign banned use of it for their staff for national security reasons...bud!

Interesting...you added 3 trillion to the national deficit in 3 years, and your mishandling of a pandemic has already crashed the economy, reduced the GDP by 1/3 and fucked everyone's 401k...so how could Biden do worse? 🤔
He isn’t the only one. Then Biden will be out because he is half brain dead and we will have this monster
Just read what you just said. Please get that proof unedited have Biden and yourself go in front of the TV cameras and then ask him right there if he won and became president would you raise taxes by 3 trillion dollars and see what he says then take that proof and give to media
Mr. Biden   needs to appeal to Tiktok users right now. Today. Promise them, that if trump bans the app, he will have it back up and running, on day one of his Presidency. 800M on TikTok #SaveTikTok #SaveTikTok2020

I don't think Trump is losing Missouri even in a scenario where the bottom completely drops out for him.  Maybe — maybe — Biden will match Obama's 2008 numbers. That's about as much as he can hope for.

Biden campaign blasts Trump over Putin call that did not discuss Russian bounties on U.S. troops in Afghanistan
I used to be her constituent.  She backstabbed Obama and Biden on the TPP. I sent multiple letters to her urging her to stop, it fell on deaf ears.
I mean, Bernie and most of his supporters have handled all of this graciously and constructively, and came to the table to bargain over policy and stakeholdership in a Biden administration.  Turner hasn't done that. So why should she get any job from Biden, let alone the big one?
Yes, this is exactly what Biden needs: some random appointed ex-state legislator no one has ever heard of, who has never won an election in her life, and who has repeatedly attacked Biden and compared him to feces.
This is important. My impression is that one key reason Black voters backed Biden is that bond with Obama — he was fiercely loyal and never tried to use his white privilege to steal the show from him.  It matters that he be able to pay forward that trust to his running mate.
Man, the Trump campaign is stupid. They should be trying to attack everyone *except* Bass to trick Biden into picking her, THEN go to town on her.
you deserve so much from America.   I'm hoping with the next election Biden finds a great job for you to serve in.  You are a hero! You are a Patriot! Thank you so much for your service.

Dems need all the time they can after the election to convince everyone with lies that Biden won.  "If you hear something long enough, you will believe it as truth"
Painfully obvious.. Joe Biden is suffering from limited brain activity .. 😳😳
I'm glad for Biden and all, but I'm not sure he's up to the shitshow he's left, or the very real possibility of a civil war.  But at least he knows some good people... I guess.
Thanks for the response. What if Biden said he promises to fight for UBI harder than any other policy, but he does not care about the funding method?Biden has been a waste of skin since he was first elected.

I'm really curious why people who are anti-Biden &amp; Trump aren't putting their energy backing Howie Hawkins, who is arguably the best, currently running candidate. And if you're a "he won't win anyways" type person, you just answered why the DNC keeps push out shit candidates.
Apparently the American electorate is so dumb, and American media sources are so inept and corrupt that this election will actually just come down to whether Russia or China has a better propaganda machine. We're all fucking doomed.
I agree , I think Trump maybe has about a 28% chance of winning. It's obvious Mr Biden is a visionary and inspires people with his powerful speeches. Oh, did I mention that Trump only had a 28% chance of defeating Hillary in 2016😂😂😂
As I expected, this was a good call by Biden.

Biden &amp; Pelosi accuse Trump of using the Bible as a prop. Maybe he does. But he does understand that nowhere in the Bible does God approve of Abortion, Homosexuality or lawlessness. They both believe that God does approve? What Bible they reading?
I hate Trump as much as the next but I would sooner die than vote for Biden
Breaking News U.S. Intelligence says Russia working to Disparage BIDEN..
Smart lady. But like BLM &amp; others, the cancel culture has turned 90% of America against them. Biden attacks Trump over Bible, but at least Trump knows that the Bible does not support Abortion, Homosexuality or lawlessness. But Pelosi and Biden believe God does?
But Biden will confiscate them all 😂😂😂😂
“I supported Bernie 100%,” but really, what’s not to criticize about Biden? I don’t know what the purpose is at this moment, but he’s pretty awful. I’ll grind my teeth and vote for him but to hell with anyone who tells me to act like he’s fine. He isn’t fine, but Trump is worse.
Says the man who feels protests with hundreds are okay. Or allows casinos and taverns to reopen but shuts down churches. If this was a Biden event he'd have said nothing. Can't stand one side saying "it's not a partisan issue" before making it one themselves. Can't stand this guy
Biden just did something that  never does as president. He apologized, when he was wrong .
I’m both Black and Hispanic. My thought per his statement the Hispanic has differences within culture. Hence, I am half Cuban. My traditions may include differences than my ex husband who is Dominican. From the Black perspective Biden statement encourages Blacks to work together.
And if it's Harris they'll have a field day with her time as a prosecutor. Look.. No matter whom Biden picks, the Republican chimps will fling their 💩 at her! I love Rice. Ditto Harris. Either way, I'm good!
Biden pick for VP?

I don't get it either and word is senator Johnson is helping Russia go after Biden. Trump has weakened our democracy and Republicans do nothing.
Russia is denigrating Biden to help Trump. And like Trump and the GOP,  Russia is also spreading misinformation about Covid-19 and vaccines. How is this not an attack on our country with the help of traitors in our government?   Explain it to me like I'm a five year old.
First and foremost, any person that thinks Biden will be the nomination is surely lost. Biden will be yanked in September for the candidate the deep state really wants! It is all a shit show to mislead the American public!!

China Biden is only 3 months away from fixing all of China's issues. And Russia knows that Trump will go after them like he is China. He is doing that right now by removing troops from Germany. Big tax money they will lose, but they are replacing it with Russian gas money.
My commitment to you is: I will never apologise for being racist. -Joe Biden
The difference is that China and Iran didn't prop up Biden years ago with funding to a bank that would write him blank checks to pretend he was a successful businessman enabling him to impress the public as a bossman reality TV star so he could make a successful bid for President

Some say that Biden may not debate at all. I'm starting to believe them. Forget about Politics, this guy is way gone. I don't believe he would be able to call a Bingo game much less run the country. I'm not even joking. How can you watch this and say, yeah he could be President.

Another Texas poll has Biden +10.
I don’t think anything short of Biden repeating the N word over and over is going to get either of those populations to vote for trump.

Somehow when Joe Biden declared his running mate would be a woman of color no one called him racist or sexist. Wonder if it would have been that way if Trump said he was doing the same?

Any vote not going to Biden is a vote for the most corrupt president in US history.

This bullshit about Biden’s comments are ridiculous. I’ve got friends who are Mexican, Texican, Californiacan, New Mexican, Puerto Rican, El Salvordoran, Ecuadorian, Brazilian, Spanish, Colombian, Honduran and Peruvian. They are diverse in ways Black people can’t even think abut.

They would not be in ICE custody if our Congress did their jobs and stop the "illegal" immigration into America. We have a great system and everybody wants it, but we need to control it. Democrats want votes &amp; a replacement for black voters. Biden proved that yesterday.
Bret let’s make a wager on this prediction.  You can have the field and I’ll have Biden to be the Democratic nominee. We’ll escrow to a reputable 3rd party.
Trump: Biden will 'hurt the Bible' and 'hurt God'
Yeah, Biden hates black for saying that, but Trump regularly calls black people N*****s and he is their savior? Only white people think black people like Trump. Diamond and Silk are starring in 'Get Out 2: Get Way Out'
His only goal here was to try to make it seem like Biden messes up the names of places, and Trump couldn’t even get that right. There are no palm trees in Indiana. What an absolute moron.
Well firstly IF he’s not: It’s Kanye’s business model for free press.  He’s not going to pull voters away from Biden. But may draw out undecided voters &amp; andnyounger conservative electorate. Trump &amp; Kanye west have been meeting privately long before this. They’re both savvy
NBC blaming this on Trump or going to give him credit for all the work that his administration has done that give this father the chance to live? And sorry but kids in America are not under anybody's control. This virus may be Trumps downfall, but America's downfall will be Biden
Biden is being protected by the DNC and the media they control. And his record supports what he said and you cannot destroy or bleach those records. Biden &amp; ObamaGate are failing daily. AG Barr will put the final nail in.

If Kamala is chosen, prosecutorial past to suppress votes. create an ad showing her attack Biden during the debates... turn off a number of voters.  Benghazi is nothing compared to the red meat Kamala will hand  them
A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for domestic terrorism.
This kind of stupidity is horrifying, since it is driving the worst policy decisions every made by any administration in the history of this country. Not sure that even the election of Biden and a Democratic Congress can fix this mess. We may be doomed.
I mean his own polling average has Biden +8 in Michigan but his map has it as a pure toss-up, so shouldn’t be surprised.
No one needs to paint Joe Biden he is psychedelic all by himself. Biden is a racist pedophile
Can someone retweet this to  ? She calls Biden a rapist, she says no credible evidence against trump rape allegations.
The report I saw on my local news this am reported what Biden said, played trump's response, then mentioned how trump has also had his issues w race.   So, just listening to the story, Biden's ill-worded comment is = to trump's racist actions and words. Equivalency rules the day!
Black voters see Trump as a ‘threat’ — and that’s partly why Biden isn’t hurt by gaffes: political scientist
Joe Biden's America...
Intelligence officials provide details on Russian disinformation campaign against Biden: report
Of course they are if he could pull votes from Biden
Trump falsely says Biden, a practicing Catholic, is "against God"  A Catholic who believes in killing pre-born and newly born babies ? WE don't think so !!!
Almost every Biden interview features  a very public cognitive decline.  Think Hillary is going to step in?
Like Nixon went to jail? Biden will pardon him, and then a year later, we'll see Trump and Obama and Bill Clinton sitting side by side, raising money for typhoon relief. Business as usual. The elite class protects its own, politics be damned.
Anyone wonder why conservatives post so many clips of Biden gaffes? This explains it
And not a word about What Biden said about you yesterday? Nice 👍🏾  😂😂
I vote for Biden is a vote for Trump.   Vote Howie Hawkins!  #VoteGreen
You spelled Jill  #Biden and  wrong.
"Screw Biden, I can't wait to vote for AOC!" "Dude, if Biden doesn't win, you'll never get a CHANCE to vote for AOC."
We all joke around about Trump derangement syndrome but it’s truly a thing!  I live up in Hernando County and Trump flags are everywhere. There are a few crazy Biden people but you really have to be crazy to vote for him! The guy is off his rocker.
Has Biden questioned the 64 civil rights bill? Trump has.  You are gonna lose on this. Considering Stephen Miller is in the white house
So, Biden and Trump both believe in fairy tales. This doesn't help Biden.
This doesn't help Biden, not for me at least.
Opinion articles from WSJ.para phrase “Biden’s wants the socialist agenda of has moved totally left and is looking for supporters Sanders.”Encrease all taxes in next 10 yrs by$10,000,000,000,000 how about us?
The entire Obama administration committed  fraud against this nation by hiring a British spy, selling uranium to Russians, spying on Americans, not accepting a Presidential election, lied under oath.  But yeah, golf. Where's the story on Hunter Biden and his China cash?
Joe Biden’s verbal gaffes are the proof of his true heart! He doesn’t care about black lives! He PANDERS to the black vote every election cycle! He Co-authored the 1994 Crime Bill. He locked up millions of young black men? He called them every name in the book. #JustSayNo
Let me break it down for you w/liberal "logic:"   is the white guy that  was essentially forced to pick, because he calculated that he'd never have won the election with a black VP pick.  So in a sense, Biden is a form of continued discrimination, they'd say.
I'ma vote for Biden he say off the wall shit but he's old with experience..I know the👸🏾 VP ain't gone let no fuck shit slide they never do..I hope she for the BLK man as well not no gay shit or no scorn agenda on BLK Man...If She 💯 the world will be a better place..Markmyworf
Good Morning and Happy Friday! I assume Joe Biden said something racist today. Can someone fill me in please?  #JoeBidenIsARacist
Covid-19 is better than  Biden-20
As a Hispanic nothing Biden said that was not true. Hispanics Cole from more diverse backgrounds than Blacks. That's just a fact.  It's funny how the same people who hate Blacks/Hispanics try to get on Biden
When they're paying Biden millions then, hey, they're not bad folks
At this point if Biden can’t deliver on a cage match with the Host of Hosts then I don’t know how you can ask anyone to vote for him.
Biden’s contempt for black people rivals his contempt for anti corruption laws.
We had better options but just like in 2016, the DNC wanted their candidate &amp; succeeded. We're in the middle of a pandemic with millions more unemployed &amp; without health insurance. And the subject of healthcare for all is MIA. You see the Biden fans talking about that? Nope.
Look no further than Hunter Biden to know what kind of man Joe is
How is he “reaching”? This is as overtly racist as it gets, yet you’re willing to give it a pass because of your manufactured hatred of Trump. If you really hated “racists” you would stand against what Biden says here, not defend it by pointing to Trump. Critical thinking is lost
How was I wrong? Communists have no faith except in Goverment. Which part of Biden’s faith tells him that laws do not need to be followed? Citizens are losing more of their rights. But if you’re happy with that, maybe you’ve just been well trained by the media to accept it.
So maybe they are worried Bernie can still go public and say Biden is a miskate.
It's cool guys, Joe Biden has a black friend.
"The keys predict that Donald Trump will lose the White House this year."
And he did ALL THIS while Clinton/Obama/FBI/DNC conspired to commit TREASON against him and the US.  Biden isn't showing affection. He's fondling and stroking and "grooming" the children. Professionals have observed his #JoeBidenIsAPedo behavior and they have the SAME reaction.
Bevelyn Beatty "Tell us how you really feel Joe Biden!" 😂🤣😂🤣
You really are ignorant. It's very well known that Biden is a teetotaler. But good luck with rehab, bro.
Come on Back to #NYC everything is just peachy!  #nycblackout  #Biden #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica #DemocratsTheEnemyWithin
Biden can win election in part bc DT is a narcissistic sociopath. What's so hard 2 understand? Obviously, debates will be important. Biden also has a track record of public service. I just worry he'll make a gaffe that he can't recover from &amp; we'll have a disaster of 4 more years
#BlackLivesMatter , but not to Biden....only interested in the votes; not the people.
Blloomberg didn't want Biden to be the man.
Biden WILL try to take our guns and it won't end well.

Personality matters. Harris is the best VP choice because she’s a fighter, naturally. Biden is more of a “calm” leader. Harris will even out the ticket.   Best of both worlds. #BidenHarris2020
There's no comparison. Biden is an obvious choice for  most people. But he continues to stay things that won't help him in November.
Jobs added and unemployment drops again and all those who hate Trump are putting a negative spin on it.   How about just rooting for the USA?  If Biden wins I'm still going to root for the USA. If Trump wins I'm still going to root for the USA.
Biden Campaign Cancels Trip Upstairs  via
Another comment Biden and his campaign were forced to clarify. If he keeps this up, his huge lead over the sociopath is going to dwindle. Folks will remember the headline and not the clarification.

Stop this manufacturing consent. stop it right now. Both Joe Biden and Donald Trump are right wing corporate supremacists who only care for the rich. Progressive will NOT vote for either of them and neither should you. But then you are not a genuine progressive.
I hope Biden let’s the VP pick announce herself before the campaign does.
Following Biden's mea culpa, #CNN, #MSNBC defend former VP after virtually ignoring latest gaffes. #FakeNews
I watched Biden last night and thought I was viewing aTom Shillue impersonation!
Please remember! First and foremost, any person that thinks Biden will be the nomination is surely lost. Biden will be yanked in September for the candidate the deep state really wants! It is all a shit show to mislead the American public!!

“ If Biden wins the presidency, we know Republicans will try to make the recovery as crushingly slow and miserable as possible. As Ryan Cooper notes, Republicans are showing us this right now”
And as I've said repeatedly, I have plenty of issues w/Biden that aren't limited to word gaffes. When he asked the reporter if he was a junkie, was that because he stutters? The list is long. He's lucky his opponent is abhorrent.
Over 300 DNC delegates, members urge Biden to pick Bass for VP  A stone cold "Castro " loving communist !! Fits the Democrat party today !!!
His account is a bot profile. He literally comments  on trump and Biden posts the exact millisecond they are posted. Everyone knows this account is run by a loser nobody
If the president wants to draw a distinction between his and Biden's relationships with God, then he should be prepared to show evidence of his claims.  Call. Him. On. It.
Think I'll take my chances, to me  Trump does care unlike Obama who made a sh*t ton of money off Americans,  and still does. He did give uplifting speaches tho. I'll take the pompous guy who stinks at public speaking, but gets the job done. (Biden Never ever! )thanks 4 relpy😊
I know Trump says some DUMB shit. But man, when's the last time Biden said anything that was immediately met with backlash?   We're so fucked in November.
This man doesn’t make any sense. We have to remember trump is a business man, he is one of the best in the world at selling his services/things to people all over the world. Every time he says something bad it gets people to talk about Trump rather then Biden.
The first of many Democrats who now see the handwriting on the wall. Keep everything shutdown and your city will die anyway. And people are not listening anyway. Americans are following Trumps lead, they get out and live life. Democrats/media want to destroy that. Biden hides.
God's super nervous about Biden destroying him, so I could see why it's important to bring these people together.
You doubted they were fake? Now they are PRE editing Biden's words to edit out all his stupid crap before they air him.
occasional mistakes are one thing (Obama said he didn't speak "Austrian" and pronounced the "p" repeatedly when referring to Navy corpsmen...) but systemic loss of memory, time and place is dementia. face it, Biden is incapable of holding office.
Well Joe Biden doesn’t have the power that trump does. Yet.... 😘

He actually goes to Church, Trump does not.   I bet you Biden can recite the Nicean creed, can Trump?
Funny then that Biden says nothing about keeping churches closed but at the same time supporting abortions. My, what a fine "Christian" to look up to...
Joe Biden, like all Democrats, believe African-Americans exist for their own benefit!
Great thread. Its tough to fathom voting Biden, but I simply cannot deal with the emboldened neonazis, fascists, kkk and this growing qanon cult...I just can't.
Donald Trump blatantly shows you how much of a quack he is, but Biden is MORE OF A QUACK &amp; MORE DANGEROUS BECAUSE HE KNOWS HOW TO HIDE IT FROM THE MAJORITY.
Congratulations to Bradshaw! The money difference in her race is stunning and raises hope for others.   (This further proves Biden did not win a legitimate primary)
He is just an idiot on so many levels, I didn't vote for Obama because he chose Biden. 😩 That is how strongly I feel about Joe, I've paid attention to him for years!
Oh man, i CANT WAIT for the trump v biden debates. it’s gonna be so good.
Now  is on to more harping on Biden and whether inarticulate comment mandates who his VP choice is. Can’t take another half hour
I am under the assumption that Biden is attempting to lose.  I dont believe he wants to br president.  He was only there to beat Bernie.  Democrat establishment WANT Trump.
But what will happen before the election is that ObamaGate &amp; crooked Biden will be exposed. Comey is going down, Yates and others are protecting themselves now. And CNN is still going to be the most inept propaganda machine on tv. How can you be so wrong about everything?
On the boxing/MMA show we debate Conor McGregor being ranked #20 in  women in boxing, Julio Cesar Chavez and save some ammo for Jason Whitlock latest column comparing BLM to the KKK and Kanye taking votes away from Biden (allegedly).
Biden: "I know I just said Black people all think the same, but what I really meant was that they didn't. Because I wanted to say whatever it was that didnt reveal my racism."
Russian bounties. $100,000 per US soldier and Trump is OK with that. Vote Biden &amp; get rid of Trump.

Joe Biden basically said, " All you niggers are the same" and y'all still wanna vote for him?? SMH
Coming from the guy who is fixated on Biden’s cock in his underwear? You touch yourself to old Joe? 😂😂😂
Compared to Trump, Biden is devout.  Do you go to Church, Jerry?
Biden is against God. Only a hateful deranged imbecile would say something as stupid, vile, and insulting like that.
Joe Biden Clarifies comments he made about comparing African Americans to Monkeys. In his statement he says he wasn't comparing them to those bad monkeys that fling poo but to the good monkeys that don't. This may not have happened but you had to think twice about it didn't you.
Its amazing how America media &amp; the DNC that controls them are doing everything they can to protect China and Iran these days. How much money is China putting in these peoples pockets? We know they own the VP Biden/Obama, NBA, CNN, MSNBC, NBC, CBS &amp; ABC. How many others?

👇The true story is...”Biden Insulted the Black Community”. Period !!! Nothing to with Trump. Leave Trump alone 👇
Biden meant (but poorly communicated) that the Latino community comes from many different countries, including Mexico, Cuba, Brazil, Guatemala, etc. Black Americans have been here for 100s of years. Trump has also been misrepresented, but more often he means exactly what he says.
Didn't even have to ask the caviar maker for dirt on Joe Biden 👍

History shows you are the worst person to talk! If your supporters don't care about grabbing women, credible rape allegations, tens of thousands of lies, Bible photo ops while tear gassing peaceful protests, cheating on 3 wives &amp; paying off a porn star, a Biden gaff means ZERO!
I can only hope that in the debates, Biden brings up something about the bible to which Trump will only be able to have his dumb look -- to prove he is not and never has cared anything about religion. Personally I'm an atheist but it would be funny.
So, Biden says something about the black community being monolithic...  ...and trump's response is that he is no longer worthy of "the Black Vote"   Do I have that right? Or should I have a 3rd cup of coffee?
What happened to Joe Biden?  Nothing.  He's just getting fucking old.  He's old af and he should be sitting on a rocking chair on his front porch.  In no way, shape or form should he be running for President of the United States.
Just talked to some friends about this. I personally can’t stomach voting for biden given his record is an indication of how he’ll govern. However, I completely understand you (and my friend’s) POV. Since I live in SC I’m voting green but also can’t be mad at those voting blue.
Actually, that's what Biden did.   "If you don't vote for me you ain't black"  Stop projecting.

Is #FoxNews and #CNN working together? I heard the Fox anchor mention #Biden was a "practicing #Catholic" when criticizing #Trump for saying Biden didn't believe in God. So I changed the channel to CNN and they said the same thing! Didn't Biden flip-flop of gov't paid #abortions?

Joe Biden calls out black Americans for not being diverse like Hispanics. Well that would be untrue only if black people would be offended &amp; not vote for this racist idiot. So far I am not seeing much outrage from black Democrats. Joe knows they will vote Democrat no matter what.
I wonder how Biden landed that whopper of an endorsement. (Free Golden Corral for life?)

If thats NOT racist, then what is?   has been called racist after his truthful statements were taken out of context, But Biden isn't a racist for this demeaning, self-serving lie that is completely in context?

I don’t understand anyone who would vote for Biden.  I was the same as you in 2016.  Absolutely could not vote for Hillary.
Yes I saw that. For the lady on the ad to blame trump for it to. Like we need to see Joe biden ads on fox. Don't think cnn or msnbc are showing any ads for trump on their channels. So sick of people blaming trump for everything. Fox needs to stop showing liber ads.
Doesn't Kanye have the right to run for President? He is just another choice for people. I tell people, if you don't like Trump and are concerned about Biden and his mental capacity - write in Kanye, even if he is not on your ballot.
Just saw a reprehensible political ad by Dems. First we had blaming Republicans for throwing Grandma off a cliff now we have one blaming Republicans for killing Grandma off with Covid. Sickening!
Why must I vote for Biden? So he can look bad due to Governors and Dem majors that are gay and weak. No Thank you but had enough of the dems already. Dena Titus will get my vote due to her staff, not her, if I dont get a call back about my PUA &amp; an US Army issue I had back in 198
Hey Biden tweet writer; You're trying too hard. At least make an attempt to make it sound like Joe. (fail)

I know a few "pox on both their houses" third party voters who could conceivably be convinced to vote Biden.  But I think time and effort is better spent driving turnout among Dems than trying to persuade the lunatic fringe to come back to reality.
"Great minds" think alike. Donald and Kanye thought up this half-baked plan to steal votes from Joe Biden. M orons A re G overning A merica
I would act like I really wanted a debate bad, then trump would refuse. Then when trump wants a debate say it’s too late. Trump does more self harm than Biden could ever inflict on him.
We know this isn’t u tweeting Mr. Biden, Ots clear as day and not sincere.
Republicans push Kanye 2020. But will it really hurt Biden?.  via
I know voting biden is going be a possum screaming on top of garbage. I hate this election and just American politics overall. I wish i felt like i had a better 3rd choice
so basically fuck joe biden
Now do Trump. Also, I agree both Biden and Trump have and can be racist at times. Takes a man to own up to it though.

God damn Joe Biden is a fuckin idoet!! I pray Joe Biden is just a babbling ole fool and not an inveterate racist!!  Stay in the hole Joe so we can get America back again!!
I am a combat veteran of the Vietnam War and an antiwar activist  Hillary Clinton and now Joe Biden voted for the Iraq war  Globalism entails control by multinational corporations and global banks  The Clintons, Obama and Biden are globalists!  I will not vote for Biden or Trump
Don’t think Biden can beat Trump over COVID-19 response cuz anyone can. All you need to do is just listen to Dr. Tony Fauci and you’ll win slowly and painfully.
Kanye is on my last nerve with his bullshit.
I am still voting for Joe Biden. He will be a great President. He will help bring our country back together again. He will let science dictate how to get this pandemic under control. He will govern us consistently and rationally, and he will rebuild our international alliances.
Biden is a Clinton puppet.
Don't listen to the experts or look at the polls. Vote on November 3rd like Joe Biden is way behind!
Trump is a liar.  The Trump Campaign will tell lies every day about Joe Biden.  Resist the lies! Vote for Joe on November 3rd!
Can't believe this!   Latino community is diverse, ‘unlike the African American community’  CC:
I would pay to watch trump debate Biden on pay per view would you ?
These people are sick yo. But vote for Biden 😂 they should let Trump send the feds in their and shoot all these people
Seriously? What an arrogant remark! –  Latino community is diverse, ‘unlike the African American community’
You mad cause he grabbed pussy ? How many women be grabbing dicks ? Women also have more sexual partners then men. What about trans women and men ? Trans women grab dick everyday ? You think Biden never grabbed pussy? I mean he fought corn pop he definitely grabbed some that day
Oh yeah, I remember when he stated that latinos are rapists and crimminals... Oh, that wasnt Biden 😬🤔
Appreciate that, but it’s all good.   I should have left Biden M4A alone. While I do feel  saying he “promised to veto any” is innaccurate, it is true that he has never supported it/it is not likely to pass with him as pres.   I need to get a better understanding of the $ part
Last paragraph say's "And West was eager to criticize Biden, and expressed comfort with the idea of doing damage to the former vice president’s White House chances. “I’m not denying it; I just told you.”
I agree. There’s no point in a debate. We know that Biden is the only choice. I’m not worried about losing, Joe would crush him. Donnie boy won’t answer any question straight up so what’s the point of a debate
What racist comment from  #Biden        #Trump2020Landslide #TrumpThreatensAmerica
Did this mf just say we all the same? Except for a few notable exceptions? Fuck u Joe Biden
Joe Biden will never stop fighting for people of color and never stop listening? 8 YEARS in office as V.P. to a black president and neither of these bozo's did anything of substance, during that time frame, to make substantial changes for the Black community. COME ON MAN!
ALL GLORY TO GOD for your strength and intelligence AND Biden’s STUPIDITY!!! Good will definitely prevail in November 🇺🇸
Are you trying counter Poor old Biden’s daily gaffes?
Maybe you aren’t reading the tweets, he made the joke, I just responded. I know you are blinded by your hate, but Trump is gonna lose. Forget my opinion. Biden is a 2/1 favorite on the largest betting xchange in the world. Better than my or your opinion.
Biden: Unlike African-Americans, Latinos Are 'Diverse'
Joe Biden will never debate President Trump! The libs are going to make every excuse in the book! Liberals are the biggest liars in America!
Who’s going to be Biden’s pick this week for president 😂😂😂
Tweet my on November 4th, I’ll be happy to admit I was wrong if Biden loses. Trump has lost so much support I do no believe Biden can lose.
I wasn’t trying to get him off the hook. You said he “Promised to Veto M4A”.  I assumed you had a source, I was wrong. It’s funny that you guys say we shouldn’t look for an actual quote after putting words in his mouth.   I know it’s hard for you to accept, but Biden wins easily.
We plan to do just that on November 3. Then we’ll have to fumigate the White House before a real president moves in.   We’ll get the limos, helos and air force one steam cleaned. Then President Biden can strat to rescind all the idiotic things you’ve done. Along with arresting u.
You're absolutely right, the things that Joe Biden says are inexcusable.
Well she's Latina no better race to recruit Latin voters. A lot of people have had a change of heart shows how despicable Trump is.  Symone Sanders former Bernie Sanders spokesperson is an advisor/spokesperson for Biden today. People change necessitated by new circumstances.
Well that’s the most ignorant thing I’ve ever heard. What if you don’t like his VP?  You going to vote for trump?  Who put the most unqualified person he could find in every important position in his administration!  Do us a favor. If you don’t vote for Biden, don’t vote at all!
I’m not a Dem. I’m not afraid of losing. I am quite confident Biden wins easy even though I’m not a huge supporter.   I do feel that HONEST debate is important. Biden never ran on M4A so no he’s not likely to pass it. Clearly Trump won’t either so suggesting he would is crazy.
No one saying they will leave if Biden wins tho 🤣
And if you don't vote for Biden you aint a non-diverse black person
So Sabrina says “Biden has Promised to Veto M4A” and then you suggest I am barking up the wrong tree when I ask fir prof of the promise. Lol.   Maybe, just maybe, if there aren’t clear and direct quotes we shouldn’t represent that a specific promise exists. Wasn’t my statement.
Biden has as many gaffs now as China does people!!!
Nicely said by Biden!!!
Both have a very sketchy history of being racist.
Susan Rice is the VP Biden needs (Opinion) - CNN
People are so tired of you #45 that, they don’t need a debate between you and VP Joe Biden, they just want to get rid of your ass!! They only one ready to cheat, lie and steal this Presidential race is you because that’s the only way you will win!!
Please, first of if you do not understand the complexities at age 77 when will you, second Biden has been fighting for racism over 40 years. They are both junk candidates out of time and during this critical time, we would need something better than this. The Arctic had 100 F 🙄
I just was put into twitter jail for calling Joe Biden a lying racist pedophile asshole!
Me? Stop pretending he did.   I supplied the EXACT QUOTE. It absolutely does NOT say that.   You can twist it as much as you want.   In fairness to Biden he didn’t run on M4A. The question itself is reduculous without more info like how it’s gonna be paid for.
You better vote for him. I already told you to stop being ridiculous. Biden has always made gaffes. Big deal.
Ok we get it by now. Biden is🗑️. Trump is💩. But all I see is criticism. Nobody ever mentions legit alternatives.  Howie Hawkins. Jo Jorgensen.  Duopoly won't just disappear. That convo needs to happen. I'd be at peace if I felt US voters voted based on confidence, not fear.
Do what you gotta do. Trump is awful. But don’t look me in the eye and act like Biden is even remotely a good person or candidate. Lets not kid ourselves.
Sir, the fact alone that you defend  that we even talk about this, is insane.  lies, that's it. Done.  So tmr when he claims the sun will never shine again if Biden is elected, do we need a commission and sientists and some research to prove him wrong??
Corn Pop made me say it!   Joe Biden clarifies comments comparing diversity in Latino and African American communities
I don’t think he is listening to his Black staffers. Although Biden has and continues to apologize, he still makes these “Archie Bunker” like racist comments.  He didn’t think he ever did anything wrong. He had Chris Dodd, Ed Rendell and Larry Summers as advisors. Says it all
WATCH: Biden Says Black People Are Not As Diverse As Hispanics. Trump Responds. -
Yeah.  I still cant stand Biden with Barbara Lee next to him.  Besides, if you are on the VP list, then you have already sold out behind the scenes.  If Lee was selected, that would be a stain on her.
Yeah but but but IT IS JUST NOT TRUE. Other than that it’s slll good.  Don’t vote for Biden if you don’t want to, but suggesting Trump is better for health care is pretty reduculous.
If he said it show me because I can’t find it.   What Biden says when asked was "I would veto anything that delays providing the security and the certainty of health care being available now," full quote below.
It wasn't Biden standing in front of a Church with the Bible Cross upside down. That gesture indicates Satan.
Instead of covering for Biden, we to get on his damn campaign to fix the candidate.  Biden is a disaster.
Well thats something made up! How is it? That he put African Americans to work, when Biden and Obama unemployed them for 2 terms, For illegals to work! And also left them homeless.
I dont hate Rice.  Dont know much about her other than she has Pelosi's support (which makes me wary).  I do despise Biden however.  He is my enemy and no VP is going to change that.
Mr. Biden (your trolls) don’t have the right to lecture WE THE PEOPLE on our VOTING RIGHTS! You (your trolls) are nothing but LIARS &amp; EVIL!
Lol so you brought up trump why? Fake news. Joe biden is a pedo
Still better than Biden in a way.  Cant veto #MedicareForAll
Biden is just the lesser of 2 evils. That is 21st century politics.
#BernieSanders calls on #JoeBiden to debate healthcare. Why does Biden think America cannot guarantee healthcare to all citizens? #BernieJoeDebate2020
I don't know much about Kanye West except that people in the comments say he has mental problems. So, it appears that one deranged mind is trying to help another. But anybody who votes for West is not taking the election process seriously. Everything is at stake Nov. 3! Biden 💪!
Biden raises eyebrows with remark contrasting African American, Latino diversity
To be honest, Im not voting for Biden if he selects Rice either.  I cant imagine any VP that would motivate me to vote for him because it wont change his values.
Biden faces backlash for comparing diversity in African American, Latino communities President Trump seized on the comments as "a very insulting statement."
Decided to stalk me huh? Can’t get enough.   Biden may say something racist “on accident”, but Trump will say something racist on purpose. Again. And his supporters will eat it up. Again.
If we don’t get Biden in by next January, this country will crash and burn.
Kanye West Admits Presidential Campaign Aims to Hurt Biden’s Prospects  via
Extraordinary!  Very, very well done.  VP Biden has handled this perfectly.
Lol like do you really think that we believe this is Joe Biden tweeting and not his intern? 😆
I absolutely agree, Biden's dementia will force him out of office before 2024 or the strain of the Presidency will force him out. Whoever is Vice President will rise to be the President before 2024, no doubt.Biden cannot form a sentence right now, and it's going to worse everyday
You are 100% correct.  Biden was terrible during the Democratic primary debates.  Every interview he made during the pandemic he’s a major offensive and it’s usually against the same Black people that saved his ass in South Carolina.
So for everyone being too negative about it: you're either voting for Biden or you're voting for Trump. And everything in between is a vote for Trump. I'm disheartened by the people who say they won't volunteer or donate if their VP pick isn't chosen. Grow up. 🤦‍♂️
It’s more people than Biden got at his rallies.
Just saw the Biden interview &amp; holy cringe, how did Bernie or Warren not beat this guy? 🤦🏼‍♂️
What gets me is this trends and #TwitterMob #Twits lose their minds but  saying African Americans are not as diverse as Hispanics is perfectly fine. 🙄🤦 #Hypocrisy #SocialismisaMentalDisorder #WalkAwayFromDemocrats
If Biden wins can we all come over to y'all's state? Please...
radical leftists do not support biden LMAO  the candidates in this race range from center-right to far-right
Once again Trump wrote his speech while looking in a mirror it is about him not Biden
Joe Biden confirms that African-Americans are NOT the Black Monolith from 2001: A Space Odyssey
FIRST YEAR TO VOTE AND I HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN TRUMP AND BIDEN WTF IS THIS BRUV
Tom Steyer. I hope Biden can sweet talk our enemies. He'd be  a good school master (uh..maybe not) but as a leader of thr Country you have to be able to deal with  eyes in the back of your head. I don't think all sweetness and love will cut it.
Hard to believe many would buy what Biden says!
So you're saying Fox and Friends is bad?    Would love to chat more, but I need to switch over to the 5G and discuss with Bill Gates, George Soros and Joe Biden how we're going to hurt God. Thoughts and prayers, my friend.
Thats because trump is refering to himself as god. And when Joe Biden wins that will hurt trump a.k.a god to his self and followers.
Biden wouldn’t ever be invited to the cookout; namely because he’d call it a barbeque.
I am voting for Biden and I don't care who the VP is.After seeing all three, i have to ask when Joe Biden became an eldritch horror?
China, Iran, if you’re listening ... US intelligence accuses Russia, China and Iran of election meddling – live
This is precisely what Biden, in his usual blundering Bidenistic way, was trying to say yesterday. Black Americans share much more of a common ancestry through the institution of slavery; Hispanic Americans emigrated under a bunch of different cultures and circumstances.
This is a good hire.  is certainly more conservative than I am, but Florida is full of conservative and centrist Latinos who fled Communist regimes. Her advice on how to reach these voters will be indispensable.
Right? Biden could end up winning this by hanging out in his basement.
Democrats will certainly lose seats in 2022 if Biden wins, but it's not going to be as bad as 2010 was. That majority was built mainly with rural seats trending away from Democrats; this one was built with suburban seats trending towards them.
How many underground basement levels does the White House have? Will Biden be able to change them daily and think he’s in a new White House each day?
I blocked this woman months ago. I hated how she bashed Bernie then thanked him for dropping out and falsely proclaimed unity with Biden. Can’t stand her fake bs
By Biden? lol. If that happens, then we know the left interfered with the election.
Biden 2020!! If you are still infatuated with sTUMP you must be on his payroll!! #GoJoe2020
Neither donald trump nor Joe Biden will provide the necessary leadership to push the United States in the right direction on this.  trump is actively working against it, calling climate change a hoax, and Biden is beholden to donors who will not allow necessary legislation.
Over 300 DNC delegates, members urge Biden to pick Bass for VP
If Biden believes what he says then let him go to China first but not allowed to return for 20 years
I would wait in an 8 hour line, underwater, with a scuba tank full of COVID coughs, to vote for Joe Biden.
While Biden might not be my first choice, Trump is definitely my last choice.
I'll be fine with either one, and I understand the appeal of Rice from Biden's perspective, but I still think Harris is a clearly better choice.
Ok. Do you believe tRump? I think it is now documented that he has lied to US (you know, the U.S.) over 20000 times, since he took office. Pretty classy move on sleepy Joe’s part; but tRump said god needs protecting from Biden?!? I’ll wait for your input...
You failed the American people in your actions toward this deadly virus. 160,000+ people are dead on your watch. We're done with you! November 3rd, you're fired!! America is voting for a REAL President. Joe Biden!!

Do you remember when you and the DEMS where hostile about the early actions of Trump including the travel ban. Biden called it xenophobic. I remember.
He'll also suddenly start caring about the Hatch Act because some low-level intern at Biden's White House says something vague that can be construed as critical of the Republican Party.
People that don’t travel or relates to Latinos won’t understand it but Latinos come from different countries with different accents and ways of thinking. Biden is right. ..Biden seeks to clarify comment that Latino community is diverse, 'unlike the African American community'
Spare us the false outrage with Biden.   Perhaps ‘Tiff’ can write a thesis on Trump’s entire life of racism, bigotry, and anti-Semitism. His entire orbit includes those sporting their “ok” sign language. Give us a break.
Exactly. Biden could be terrible. But Trump is a danger to the Republic. It's as Joe says....do you want FOUR MORE YEARS of THIS?!
A  Trump Tik Tok ban is a great way to recruit more young voters ... for Biden
Joe Biden and the liberal Democrats are going to try to cancel Christmas, they have for years, Trump brought the greatness of Christmas back, we have to protect Christmas and America, Re-elect President Donald J. Trump
It isn’t a binary choice though. Trump doesn’t have to be less racist, just to make Joe look racist enough to either suppress voter turnout like he and Russia did in 2016 or detour voters from Biden to Kanye as they did with Johnson and Stein in 2016.
If you show the proof that he owns it instead of "ive read it somewhere" then this things become factual. I reas its a US governemt property and James Biden owns a part of un developed land with nothing built on it.
Hiden Biden is against God, he's pro abortion, pro close churches down he wants to change the evangelical Christian lifestyle by shutting down through covid.
If I had my choice for  running mate it would be  But I honestly DGAF. Biden could choose the corpse of Fidel Castro and his campaign would still be less Kremliny and more patriotic than the Putin owned  and Saudi owned  ticket.
Joe Biden's either too dumb to think about his comments before saying them or he's a closet racist either way he is nowhere near fit to be leader of the free world!
Biden not worthy of Black vote Latino vote any vote!!! VIVA TRUMP!
After Joe Biden's stunning admission that all black people are basically the same and not diverse at all He's either a closet racist or he's too stupid to think before he speaks. And yet there will still be many people that will vote for him.
It's only one or the other,, either Joe Biden is a closet racist because he thinks all black people are the same or he's too damn dumb to articulate what he means and it comes out as his weird broken gibberish!
Joe Biden is still a racist.   Nancy Pelosi is a constant drunk.  Chuck Schumer is a whiny bitch.   Kamala Harris is still one of the worst AG's ever, and now plastic face.   Karen Bass, Elizabeth Warren, &amp; Bernie Sanders are communist.
This further illustrates that either Joe Biden is a racist and thinks all black people are alike or he has no damn idea what he says,, he just says the first thing that pops into his mind!
That's like the biggest mystery of the 20th century is how someone of sound mind can listen to Biden talk and say wow that's who I want to be the next leader of the free world lol

That's just a tip of the bucket.  Wait till Republicans see how much health care premiums are during this Dec at open enrollment.  The health care system will go broke nationwide. BIDEN can Stop the 100% increase in  costs on day one  by redeployment of Obamacare. Lame ass
I honestly believe that Bumbling Joe Biden could drop the N word on live TV and they'd not only make excuses for him, they'd probably praise him for it. Sickening.
Thank you. List also incl Pope F, QEII, "Black Nobility," Jesuit-built NWO &amp; Secret Society leaders, Congress, Clintons, Biden. They clothe themselves in "I love God" but build fears, blame, war, oppress for self-gain. Silencers of #Truth   JEW vs GENTILE

Can previous presidents be vice president??? If so, damn Biden for locking himself up to choosing a woman.
I wouldn't vote for Biden if his people paid me. I say Trump all the way. At least Trump knows what year it is and what country he is in.
I’ll help you out. Biden is racist and he made a racist statement. To him all African Americans are the same.
If Biden chose a piece of dung for VP I would vote for him still

Defund Joe Biden.
Biden will surrender to Putin.

Without mentioning a Trump tell me why Biden would be a good president.
im not a fan of trump, but i know he's there for a greater purpose. Do you want biden to succeed even though he is apart of the the occult/NWO and hangs on a lower vibrational frequency? I don't think Harris can even save him..
Biden could choose the cold dead corpse of Pol Pot himself and I would still vote for him
I tend to agree that I don't think Iowa is Biden+6. I do think it's close, and I totally believe that Biden CAN win it, he may even be up, but +6 seems as likely as Trump's approval being over 50% according to Rasmussen.
Biden is a lifelong Catholic. Trump can't name a single passage from the Bible and doesn't even know the difference between the Old and New Testaments.
"Black people are monolithic, but those spicy Latinos - whoo!  Un Pre Dict Able.   C'mon (Monterey) jack, let's make this a big Kwayso-dill-a and get those votes. If you don't votar a Biden, no estan uno Latino. Gracias moo-chose."

That's what trump wants you to believe. Biden's been making speeches for over a month now. And what of Trump's adventure to the White House bunker?
Biden dying? Maybe? A girl can dream anyway.
If Biden wins and accomplished nothing else than eradicating Trumpalo corruption from the Federal government and making our economy, foreign affairs, and the ACA functional again he will be a success. If he works with congress to prevent another Barr and Trump, he’ll be great.
And this is the same man that eulogized Robert Byrd, a registered member of the KKK. Biden hates blacks. Black Americans need to wake up. He's no friend of yours.
WHAT DO YOU THINK? The Biden campaign has launched a new national ad focused on Black Americans, urging them to stand up to President Trump the way their ancestors stood up to "violent racists of a generation ago."
Yep. And the topline definitely matters in this race. Biden is going to blow out this district. Plus, Dems lead +9 on GCB.  Garcia needs Collin Peterson levels of ticket splitting to make this work.
This is one of the worse cases of Elder abuse I have ever seen. Everyone of us should be calling Senior Services to go and check on Biden’s Care. We have a law that anyone who believes an elderly person is in danger has a duly to all the police and have them go out and check.
Biden is just fine .And even if he’s in a coma with an endotracheal tube in his mouth we’d still vote for him over trump .
We don’t need a debate, Donny. Mr. Biden will be soberly stating facts while you call names, bully, and spew lies.  He's won before they've begun. Your presidency is a governmental tragedy of operatic proportion. #VoteHimOut

Nothing,, and as a matter of fact, most political operatives that have ever worked with Biden has said that he has been on the wrong side of every decision for the last 40 years!
I don't understand why so many people can't simultaneously vote for Biden while admitting that he's mentally infirm. Like, Trump is a fascist, why are they playing defense?
No but people who vote for mentally impaired candidates would and are voting for Biden.
We must fight like Biden is 10 points down. When people say stuff like that people stay home
I mean, the mainstream media was complicit in creating the narratives that won Biden the 55+ voters who consume more legacy media than younger voters.
We need big, structural change. We will not get that with Biden or Harris.
Biden does not know where is except when there’s little girls hair to fondle.
“I just have trash memes because facts defending Biden don’t exist.”
Biden won’t leave his house you think he’ll go to DC? He’d probably say, “As I stand her before this, um, this er- Senator McKinley I ac, expe-, take on the- um, well I know that- we are all here to- umm.”
Bro, I didn't realize Biden is 77. His ass is gonna be 81 when he's out of the office? That mofo better not run for re-election. His mind will be mush. It's already semi-mush. Really says something when this lackluster dude is the better than the alternative.

Re: Joe Biden Choice Running Mate:  I'm AFRAID... WTH will We do if he picks HILLARY C. ?? (Biden will be "incompetent" -&gt; VP next up ??😱Agghhh!
I doubt it. There’s very few true Biden supporters. There’s mostly just people who hate Trump.
I don’t think Biden  handlers will let him announce a running mate as they are working over the whole ticket. Bye bye Joe.
Biden? Really? The old senile marxist can’t even tie his own shoes. MAGA
Hey Ronna:  Beijing Biden wants Open Borders.   The Socialists want millions more illegal aliens coming into our country.   And they want to give them Entitlements that will negatively Impact Social Security.  All should see this train coming.   MJ
Biden can’t make Trump look like a bigger fool than he already does but he runs the risk of making gaffs that give the media a reason to create a close horse race for better ratings. There is no upside for Biden to debate. He already looks and acts presidential. Trump is losing.
Lindsey Graham can't ruffle Yates 💪😇Yates says Obama, Biden didn’t influence Flynn investigation
I think Biden shouldn't even be put on a ballet for he stuttered so many words just saying mental fitness or mental health. He couldn't even say that with out stuttering or his sentence broken up. I say Biden should go in and get tested for dementia or whatever the doctors say.
She wouldn’t do Biden any favors either. She faced a lot of criticism due to her inept handling of the Atlanta riots. 10/1 days he’ll pick Susan Rice.
Funny thing. Biden hasn’t had his health records available since before he became VP. Biden had two brain aneurysms in 1988, the first of which almost killed him.
there is nothing anyone can do to make biden progressive

The Biden handlers and DEMS know that gun sales are way up this year. It is estimated that 80 million people bought a gun for the first time. Could it be that the violent protests and clashes with the police have reminded Americans how important the 2A is?

Hey we have a very important announcement from the White House today Joe Biden announced that he’s going to stage a coup on the oval office he had entered bathroom....never mind it’s a poo not a coup.
He brought...? He did nothing and, luckily that was wiser than doing something. I'll give you Bin Laden. Of course, Biden was dead set against it but you're going to vote for him anyway...right?
And 80% of Biden delegates felt disrespected by the socialist party. Both of them are greatly disrespected by republican delegates. The point, the issue has been decided. Had Sanders won I would have been pissed as hell. But I would have eventually gotten over it.
I cannot wait for a debate! Trump will bring is his charts and graphs, point to them, ramble about how great everything is, make false claims about voting by mail...and this will all happen before he's even introduced!  Biden just needs to wait out his stupidity.
The selection by location is done with strategery, is WI still in play, or are there polls on the QT that show a Trump win.  Are they repositioning resources, or is Biden that far downgraded?

I feel Biden should be given a test to see he has dementia or not and then release information to media tv and doctors and the CDC make it unedited all doctors notes no black out lines and once released Biden wife should be ask some questions in front of Congress
We're all used to the POS, ... but cannot wait for the tears of the Biden haters to flow the morning of Nov 4th !
Joe Biden is pushing back at Republican assertions that he should take a cognitive test to disprove President Donald Trump's claim that the Democrat isn't fit for the Oval Office.
If a person voted in person for Joe Biden, Trump would claim fraud. He's determined to stay President with any means available. Even suing states for mail in ballots which are perfectly safe and legal.
Then vote for Biden!!!

To clarify, Biden says "Are you a junkie" NOT to Barnett, but as comparing this to someone who is told to take a drug test even though the guy wouldn't even touch the stuff. And Biden KNOWS how to pronounce Yosemite.

All these polls touting Biden ahead of Trump are not considering the fact that so many  supporters will not vote for either, again splitting the vote and giving us Trump. Don’t get complacent! #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #VoteBlueNoMatterWho2020 #VoteBiden #Vote2020

I'm really curious why people who are anti-Biden &amp; Trump aren't putting their energy backing Howie Hawkins, who is arguably the best, currently running candidate. And if you're a "he won't win anyways" type person, you just answered why the DNC keeps push out shit candidates.
Apparently the American electorate is so dumb, and American media sources are so inept and corrupt that this election will actually just come down to whether Russia or China has a better propaganda machine. We're all fucking doomed.

Biden just did something that  never does as president. He apologized, when he was wrong .
I’m both Black and Hispanic. My thought per his statement the Hispanic has differences within culture. Hence, I am half Cuban. My traditions may include differences than my ex husband who is Dominican. From the Black perspective Biden statement encourages Blacks to work together.

Pretty scary when you realize the test is real and Biden hits all 8!

Biden Campaign Doubles Down: Black Reporter ‘Deserving’ of ‘Junkie’ Comment
Joe Biden is extremely excited to debate President Trump......  via  🤣🤣🤣
Which is ironic considering the President has been far more Critical on Russia than Biden’s foreign policy ever was.
They both have told lies but just quit pretending it's only one sided.  Biden has lied his entire career and let's keep in mind he has been in politics for five decades &amp; failed!  He has already run for pres &amp; failed twice dropping out once for plagiarism soon to be 3 time loser!
Somehow when Joe Biden declared his running mate would be a woman of color no one called him racist or sexist. Wonder if it would have been that way if Trump said he was doing the same?

Biden Campaign: Black Reporter 'Deserving' of 'Junkie' Comment
Perhaps because they have more people working for them. As Joe Biden would say, "come on man.." Math
It’s no surprise that this EPA/OSHA/ATD protection was passed in 2013, during the Obama/Biden term. VOTE FOR BIDEN!
NOT ONE...ONE... BLACK CELEB SAYING FUCK BIDEN...HE A RACIST TOO⚠️⚠️  Even fukin Lebron saying vote Biden   NIGGA REALLY!!! REALLY!!!  I’m done I no longer identify as BLACK THT SHIT A COLOR word to KDOT nigga
And no doubt  ignored the most racially devisive statement EVER made by a Presidential candidate when Biden claimed blacks had no diversity of thought. But CNN made sure their viewers got wall to wall coverage on  mispronouncing Thailand.
Biden isn't even qualified to be a Congressman !
It is Vladimir Putin's White House. Joe Biden will NEVER sell us out to a foreign country. VOTE!
If ya niggas vote for Biden  I sweatergod  U the cooniest of coons King Coon Coonificient Coontastic Coonerific  HOW TF U GONE LET A WHITE MAN TELL U (ON BILL GATES INTERNET) U ALL THINK THE SAME  &amp;  IF U DONT VOTE FOR HIM U NOT BLACK  HOWWW!!!
Somebody better check the origins of this law before the start claiming it's unjust. It may backfire if Joe Biden (Senator at the time) has his fingerprints on Federal legislation that opened the door to state laws. If so the MSM will do overtime to mix it.
Anyone else notice Biden is now being called the ‘presumptive Democratic nominee’? Is this a bait and switch?      #Trump2020

#Trump haters would vote for Satan over Trump, but y’all should realize that a vote for #JoeBiden isnt a vote for him. It’s a vote for Nancy/Chuck/AOC/Bernie policies. Biden can’t run a zoom meeting, much less a country.
The Biden campaign is planning an election program that includes volunteer lawyers who will focus on poll monitoring and watching for potential voter suppression, as well as substantial funding for election law specialists. #VoterFraudIsReal #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
Sounds like he needs to meet with Biden to get the difference between a lion and elephant and a lioness In order to not offend anyone..  Complete Tool!
I like Susan Rice better, but it's up to Biden. It will not make that much difference.
You are not voting for Biden. A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for this guy.
Biden is the product of the reinvented racism of his party stemming from Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society policies. Not as apparent but racist nonetheless.
It will devestate the Dems,less so the REPs. So many see any 3rd choice as a alternative to Biden while also keeping a attachment to the Dem party by not voting for Trump. The Dems know that. Black conservative and those helped by Trump's administration won't budge.

You and your husband need to be locked up for interfering in the election. I seriously hope the Democratic party and Joe Biden sue your skank azz. You DO NOT mess with a election! #CHEATERS #OrangePuffLover
Count me out. Antifa. Portland Riots. Higher taxes. Open Borders.  Gun Confiscation. First Amendment censorship. Socialism. Green New Boondoggle. Permanent Covid Lockdown. Radical anarchism.  All that comes if Biden is elected. Venezuela will look like paradise.
Cardi B Explains Why She Endorsed Joe Biden Alongside Bernie Sanders,
How many times does he have to disrespect the black community before people refuse to vote for him! Trump has done more for the black community in 3 years that Biden did in 40+ years!
Amazing how 2k people died yesterday of a virus that the president* is ignoring and over 160k+ and counting Americans have died from and the media is focusing on a Biden statement that was true.   So. Fucking. Predictable.   They are tired of the virus and are moving on now.
Any vote not going to Biden is a vote for the most corrupt president in US history.
So, basically more unnamed sources.  I have a source that told me Biden is a secret spy for the Swiss government trying to help them take over the world.  My source is just as valid as Axios.  🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
#CNN shhh wont see it there❗ Come on Man #joebiden answer is simple comparison to drug testing the anchor are you on crack❓ #Biden2020 #fridaymorning #biden
While Trump finds it funny to deregulate as much as possible, remember that there’s a reason for regulations.  VOTE FOR BIDEN!
Do you have any videos of Joe Biden actually penning this, or was it just his CareTaker whoo wrote it?
Yes I have a habit of asking people to show me when they make declarations. When I make declarations I am happy to do so.   Just like yesterday I supplied the EXACT quote of Biden. Not afraid of facts. I prefer them.   Progressives declare M4A saves $. Why be afraid to show it?
This bullshit about Biden’s comments are ridiculous. I’ve got friends who are Mexican, Texican, Californiacan, New Mexican, Puerto Rican, El Salvordoran, Ecuadorian, Brazilian, Spanish, Colombian, Honduran and Peruvian. They are diverse in ways Black people can’t even think abut.

My homework suggests the cost is more than the annual budget. Biden says the same.   Progressives want M4A, say the math is simple then blame us because we haven’t reached the same conclusion.   I’m sorry, but it don’t buy it. If it was that simple you would just show us.
I'm so excited to vote multiple times for Joe Biden this year!
America will not bail out your losers. And Biden will destroy what is left of the party. He is waking black voters up to your "illegal" immigration agenda.
Why does  Hate Our Lord Jesus Christ? He ain't Black.  #BidenRacist #Biden
They would not be in ICE custody if our Congress did their jobs and stop the "illegal" immigration into America. We have a great system and everybody wants it, but we need to control it. Democrats want votes &amp; a replacement for black voters. Biden proved that yesterday.
Do some research please usps been know to lost ballot plus usps supports biden
you're absolutely right,  does not Joe Biden's heart, but neither do YOU even though you just said you did. 🤔 #DailyBriefing
Bret let’s make a wager on this prediction.  You can have the field and I’ll have Biden to be the Democratic nominee. We’ll escrow to a reputable 3rd party.
Trump: Biden will 'hurt the Bible' and 'hurt God'
Yeah, Biden hates black for saying that, but Trump regularly calls black people N*****s and he is their savior? Only white people think black people like Trump. Diamond and Silk are starring in 'Get Out 2: Get Way Out'
His only goal here was to try to make it seem like Biden messes up the names of places, and Trump couldn’t even get that right. There are no palm trees in Indiana. What an absolute moron.
Well firstly IF he’s not: It’s Kanye’s business model for free press.  He’s not going to pull voters away from Biden. But may draw out undecided voters &amp; andnyounger conservative electorate. Trump &amp; Kanye west have been meeting privately long before this. They’re both savvy
NBC blaming this on Trump or going to give him credit for all the work that his administration has done that give this father the chance to live? And sorry but kids in America are not under anybody's control. This virus may be Trumps downfall, but America's downfall will be Biden
Biden is being protected by the DNC and the media they control. And his record supports what he said and you cannot destroy or bleach those records. Biden &amp; ObamaGate are failing daily. AG Barr will put the final nail in.

Joe Biden's family should put him in a home already
I have never seen that for Biden anywhere.

A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for domestic terrorism.
This kind of stupidity is horrifying, since it is driving the worst policy decisions every made by any administration in the history of this country. Not sure that even the election of Biden and a Democratic Congress can fix this mess. We may be doomed.
I mean his own polling average has Biden +8 in Michigan but his map has it as a pure toss-up, so shouldn’t be surprised.
No one needs to paint Joe Biden he is psychedelic all by himself. Biden is a racist pedophile
Can someone retweet this to  ? She calls Biden a rapist, she says no credible evidence against trump rape allegations.
The report I saw on my local news this am reported what Biden said, played trump's response, then mentioned how trump has also had his issues w race.   So, just listening to the story, Biden's ill-worded comment is = to trump's racist actions and words. Equivalency rules the day!

Trump falsely says Biden, a practicing Catholic, is "against God"  A Catholic who believes in killing pre-born and newly born babies ? WE don't think so !!!
Almost every Biden interview features  a very public cognitive decline.  Think Hillary is going to step in?
Like Nixon went to jail? Biden will pardon him, and then a year later, we'll see Trump and Obama and Bill Clinton sitting side by side, raising money for typhoon relief. Business as usual. The elite class protects its own, politics be damned.
Kind of like Obama campaigning for Biden during a funeral?  lives rent free in your brain.
Anyone wonder why conservatives post so many clips of Biden gaffes? This explains it

And not a word about What Biden said about you yesterday? Nice 👍🏾  😂😂
Your think science is behind it? Under normal circumstances I would agree, though November 3rd is quickly approaching that gives just under 4 months to clean this up and make Corona disappear. Then credit Biden for the cleanup. Then Democrats claim he's unfit and swear in his VP.

Can someone convince Biden's team to just keep him quiet? Let Trump keep being stupid, but don't let Biden give interviews because it will quickly become "well both sides don't speak well."
"Screw Biden, I can't wait to vote for AOC!" "Dude, if Biden doesn't win, you'll never get a CHANCE to vote for AOC."
We all joke around about Trump derangement syndrome but it’s truly a thing!  I live up in Hernando County and Trump flags are everywhere. There are a few crazy Biden people but you really have to be crazy to vote for him! The guy is off his rocker.
Has Biden questioned the 64 civil rights bill? Trump has.  You are gonna lose on this. Considering Stephen Miller is in the white house
So, Biden and Trump both believe in fairy tales. This doesn't help Biden.
This doesn't help Biden, not for me at least.

The entire Obama administration committed  fraud against this nation by hiring a British spy, selling uranium to Russians, spying on Americans, not accepting a Presidential election, lied under oath.  But yeah, golf. Where's the story on Hunter Biden and his China cash?
Joe Biden’s verbal gaffes are the proof of his true heart! He doesn’t care about black lives! He PANDERS to the black vote every election cycle! He Co-authored the 1994 Crime Bill. He locked up millions of young black men? He called them every name in the book. #JustSayNo
Let me break it down for you w/liberal "logic:"   is the white guy that  was essentially forced to pick, because he calculated that he'd never have won the election with a black VP pick.  So in a sense, Biden is a form of continued discrimination, they'd say.
I'ma vote for Biden he say off the wall shit but he's old with experience..I know the👸🏾 VP ain't gone let no fuck shit slide they never do..I hope she for the BLK man as well not no gay shit or no scorn agenda on BLK Man...If She 💯 the world will be a better place..Markmyworf
Good Morning and Happy Friday! I assume Joe Biden said something racist today. Can someone fill me in please?  #JoeBidenIsARacist
Covid-19 is better than  Biden-20
As a Hispanic nothing Biden said that was not true. Hispanics Cole from more diverse backgrounds than Blacks. That's just a fact.  It's funny how the same people who hate Blacks/Hispanics try to get on Biden
When they're paying Biden millions then, hey, they're not bad folks
At this point if Biden can’t deliver on a cage match with the Host of Hosts then I don’t know how you can ask anyone to vote for him.
Biden’s contempt for black people rivals his contempt for anti corruption laws.
We had better options but just like in 2016, the DNC wanted their candidate &amp; succeeded. We're in the middle of a pandemic with millions more unemployed &amp; without health insurance. And the subject of healthcare for all is MIA. You see the Biden fans talking about that? Nope.
Look no further than Hunter Biden to know what kind of man Joe is
How is he “reaching”? This is as overtly racist as it gets, yet you’re willing to give it a pass because of your manufactured hatred of Trump. If you really hated “racists” you would stand against what Biden says here, not defend it by pointing to Trump. Critical thinking is lost
How was I wrong? Communists have no faith except in Goverment. Which part of Biden’s faith tells him that laws do not need to be followed? Citizens are losing more of their rights. But if you’re happy with that, maybe you’ve just been well trained by the media to accept it.
So maybe they are worried Bernie can still go public and say Biden is a miskate.
It's cool guys, Joe Biden has a black friend.
"The keys predict that Donald Trump will lose the White House this year."
And he did ALL THIS while Clinton/Obama/FBI/DNC conspired to commit TREASON against him and the US.  Biden isn't showing affection. He's fondling and stroking and "grooming" the children. Professionals have observed his #JoeBidenIsAPedo behavior and they have the SAME reaction.

Biden can win election in part bc DT is a narcissistic sociopath. What's so hard 2 understand? Obviously, debates will be important. Biden also has a track record of public service. I just worry he'll make a gaffe that he can't recover from &amp; we'll have a disaster of 4 more years

There's no comparison. Biden is an obvious choice for  most people. But he continues to stay things that won't help him in November.
Jobs added and unemployment drops again and all those who hate Trump are putting a negative spin on it.   How about just rooting for the USA?  If Biden wins I'm still going to root for the USA. If Trump wins I'm still going to root for the USA.

Another comment Biden and his campaign were forced to clarify. If he keeps this up, his huge lead over the sociopath is going to dwindle. Folks will remember the headline and not the clarification.

Stop this manufacturing consent. stop it right now. Both Joe Biden and Donald Trump are right wing corporate supremacists who only care for the rich. Progressive will NOT vote for either of them and neither should you. But then you are not a genuine progressive.
I hope Biden let’s the VP pick announce herself before the campaign does.
Following Biden's mea culpa, #CNN, #MSNBC defend former VP after virtually ignoring latest gaffes. #FakeNews
I watched Biden last night and thought I was viewing aTom Shillue impersonation!

“ If Biden wins the presidency, we know Republicans will try to make the recovery as crushingly slow and miserable as possible. As Ryan Cooper notes, Republicans are showing us this right now”
And as I've said repeatedly, I have plenty of issues w/Biden that aren't limited to word gaffes. When he asked the reporter if he was a junkie, was that because he stutters? The list is long. He's lucky his opponent is abhorrent.
Over 300 DNC delegates, members urge Biden to pick Bass for VP  A stone cold "Castro " loving communist !! Fits the Democrat party today !!!
His account is a bot profile. He literally comments  on trump and Biden posts the exact millisecond they are posted. Everyone knows this account is run by a loser nobody
If the president wants to draw a distinction between his and Biden's relationships with God, then he should be prepared to show evidence of his claims.  Call. Him. On. It.
Think I'll take my chances, to me  Trump does care unlike Obama who made a sh*t ton of money off Americans,  and still does. He did give uplifting speaches tho. I'll take the pompous guy who stinks at public speaking, but gets the job done. (Biden Never ever! )thanks 4 relpy😊
No dog for me in the Trump vs Biden fight...just a student of life so I have a question.  If Trump said the exact same thing...would your reaction be different or would you see it the same way?
I know Trump says some DUMB shit. But man, when's the last time Biden said anything that was immediately met with backlash?   We're so fucked in November.
This man doesn’t make any sense. We have to remember trump is a business man, he is one of the best in the world at selling his services/things to people all over the world. Every time he says something bad it gets people to talk about Trump rather then Biden.
The first of many Democrats who now see the handwriting on the wall. Keep everything shutdown and your city will die anyway. And people are not listening anyway. Americans are following Trumps lead, they get out and live life. Democrats/media want to destroy that. Biden hides.
God's super nervous about Biden destroying him, so I could see why it's important to bring these people together.
You doubted they were fake? Now they are PRE editing Biden's words to edit out all his stupid crap before they air him.
occasional mistakes are one thing (Obama said he didn't speak "Austrian" and pronounced the "p" repeatedly when referring to Navy corpsmen...) but systemic loss of memory, time and place is dementia. face it, Biden is incapable of holding office.
Well Joe Biden doesn’t have the power that trump does. Yet.... 😘

Funny then that Biden says nothing about keeping churches closed but at the same time supporting abortions. My, what a fine "Christian" to look up to...

Great thread. Its tough to fathom voting Biden, but I simply cannot deal with the emboldened neonazis, fascists, kkk and this growing qanon cult...I just can't.
Donald Trump blatantly shows you how much of a quack he is, but Biden is MORE OF A QUACK &amp; MORE DANGEROUS BECAUSE HE KNOWS HOW TO HIDE IT FROM THE MAJORITY.
Congratulations to Bradshaw! The money difference in her race is stunning and raises hope for others.   (This further proves Biden did not win a legitimate primary)
He is just an idiot on so many levels, I didn't vote for Obama because he chose Biden. 😩 That is how strongly I feel about Joe, I've paid attention to him for years!
Oh man, i CANT WAIT for the trump v biden debates. it’s gonna be so good.
Now  is on to more harping on Biden and whether inarticulate comment mandates who his VP choice is. Can’t take another half hour
I am under the assumption that Biden is attempting to lose.  I dont believe he wants to br president.  He was only there to beat Bernie.  Democrat establishment WANT Trump.
But what will happen before the election is that ObamaGate &amp; crooked Biden will be exposed. Comey is going down, Yates and others are protecting themselves now. And CNN is still going to be the most inept propaganda machine on tv. How can you be so wrong about everything?
On the boxing/MMA show we debate Conor McGregor being ranked #20 in  women in boxing, Julio Cesar Chavez and save some ammo for Jason Whitlock latest column comparing BLM to the KKK and Kanye taking votes away from Biden (allegedly).

Joe Biden Clarifies comments he made about comparing African Americans to Monkeys. In his statement he says he wasn't comparing them to those bad monkeys that fling poo but to the good monkeys that don't. This may not have happened but you had to think twice about it didn't you.
Its amazing how America media &amp; the DNC that controls them are doing everything they can to protect China and Iran these days. How much money is China putting in these peoples pockets? We know they own the VP Biden/Obama, NBA, CNN, MSNBC, NBC, CBS &amp; ABC. How many others?

👇The true story is...”Biden Insulted the Black Community”. Period !!! Nothing to with Trump. Leave Trump alone 👇
Biden meant (but poorly communicated) that the Latino community comes from many different countries, including Mexico, Cuba, Brazil, Guatemala, etc. Black Americans have been here for 100s of years. Trump has also been misrepresented, but more often he means exactly what he says.
Didn't even have to ask the caviar maker for dirt on Joe Biden 👍

History shows you are the worst person to talk! If your supporters don't care about grabbing women, credible rape allegations, tens of thousands of lies, Bible photo ops while tear gassing peaceful protests, cheating on 3 wives &amp; paying off a porn star, a Biden gaff means ZERO!
I can only hope that in the debates, Biden brings up something about the bible to which Trump will only be able to have his dumb look -- to prove he is not and never has cared anything about religion. Personally I'm an atheist but it would be funny.
So, Biden says something about the black community being monolithic...  ...and trump's response is that he is no longer worthy of "the Black Vote"   Do I have that right? Or should I have a 3rd cup of coffee?
What happened to Joe Biden?  Nothing.  He's just getting fucking old.  He's old af and he should be sitting on a rocking chair on his front porch.  In no way, shape or form should he be running for President of the United States.
Just talked to some friends about this. I personally can’t stomach voting for biden given his record is an indication of how he’ll govern. However, I completely understand you (and my friend’s) POV. Since I live in SC I’m voting green but also can’t be mad at those voting blue.
Actually, that's what Biden did.   "If you don't vote for me you ain't black"  Stop projecting.
First and foremost, any person that thinks Biden will be the nomination is surely lost. Biden will be yanked in September for the candidate the deep state really wants! It is all a shit show to mislead the American public!!

Wow, there goes 20 votes to West. This will surely wreck Biden's bid for President.

CNA Staff, Aug 6, 2020 / 11:30 pm (CNA).- Vice President Joe Biden on Thursday spoke about his Catholic faith, in response to comments from President Donald Trump that a Biden presidency would “hurt God.” “Like  #CatholicChurch #NewsBriefs #US
Creepy Joe Biden promised he will try to take your Armalite rifles away. That should make you sick!  Hitler and Stalin disarmed their own people.   Your right to keep and bear arms is not for hunting. We all have the right to defend ourselves from a tyrannical government.
What Joe Biden thinks about Black Americans is 'offensive and gross,' says Iraq veteran
I'm confused, I thought Bernie Sanders LOST the Primary...so why is his platform coming out of Joe Biden's mouth?  Looks like the average Democratic Voter got screwed too.  They THOUGHT their vote matter but see, not to their democratic Leadership it didnt...
And whoever the VP might just be smarter than Biden and I'm ok with that. However, VP maybe smarter than Trump and Pence put together; and I'm damn 💯 ok with that!! Least whoever the VP is, they may end up running the country and I'm ok with that!
DARLING THE WORLD NEWS TONIGHT RETWEET YOU POSTED TRASHES YOU AT THE END OF THE CLIP!   ALSO BABY BEST NOT TO SAY BIDEN ISN'T WORTHY OF THE BLACK VOTE    JOE ALWAYS TELLS BLACKS HOW THEY SHOULD VOTE WHICH IS WRONG SO YOU SHOULDN'T EITHER JUST BE CAREFUL BABY
Is #FoxNews and #CNN working together? I heard the Fox anchor mention #Biden was a "practicing #Catholic" when criticizing #Trump for saying Biden didn't believe in God. So I changed the channel to CNN and they said the same thing! Didn't Biden flip-flop of gov't paid #abortions?
Someone told me Montana looks like Joe Biden sniffing Idaho and now I can’t unsee it! #JoeBiden #SleepyJoe #CreepyJoe #Trump2020

How do you extrapolate he's trying to spoil Biden's campaign from his statement "walking to win"?
Are we not supposed to notice that Biden’s “clarification” about what he said doesn’t actually include an explanation?
Joe Biden calls out black Americans for not being diverse like Hispanics. Well that would be untrue only if black people would be offended &amp; not vote for this racist idiot. So far I am not seeing much outrage from black Democrats. Joe knows they will vote Democrat no matter what.
Nice job leftist fascists. Hiden RIDEN Biden supporters remain quiet - eyes 👀 closed. Is that somehow plausible deniability 🤔
I wonder how Biden landed that whopper of an endorsement. (Free Golden Corral for life?)
This is rich coming from a lifelong racist who doesn’t know what day of the week it is,and can’t speak three words coherently. You don’t know how to be clear Mr. Biden -
Increasingly confused, Joe Biden continues to struggle.

#FoxNews just ran another campaign against #PresidentTrump, this time using #RonaldReagan and a video clip where Trump was mocking a reporter (perpetuating the lie that he was deliberately mocking a disabled person). Liar! Trump called #Biden Sleepy Joe; Joe called him a #racist.
You see that stupid Biden commercial about are we better off than we were 4 years ago when everybody knows it's the demon rats pushing and peach ment spreading the virus creating the virus are the reason we're not better off what a bunch of scum
Yeah right....most liberals don’t know how pathetic Biden is because CNN won’t air his gaffes....the debates will ruin Biden
If thats NOT racist, then what is?   has been called racist after his truthful statements were taken out of context, But Biden isn't a racist for this demeaning, self-serving lie that is completely in context?
Biden will NOT be a President, Sir! Trump LANDSLIDE Vote it is! #TRUMPTRAIN2020  #REDLINEUP  #MAGA ❤🙏😇🇵🇭🇺🇸🎆🗽
I guess you're one of the "notable exceptions" that Biden was talking about. Lol
Trump-loving media’s attacks on Joe Biden have all been epic flops so far: data
Trump aides frustrated by his ‘nonsensical’ Biden attacks in Ohio: AP reporter
I don’t understand anyone who would vote for Biden.  I was the same as you in 2016.  Absolutely could not vote for Hillary.
Yes I saw that. For the lady on the ad to blame trump for it to. Like we need to see Joe biden ads on fox. Don't think cnn or msnbc are showing any ads for trump on their channels. So sick of people blaming trump for everything. Fox needs to stop showing liber ads.
If you want  SMART President-it wont be Joe Biden.  Everyone knows he has dementia -every time he talks it's so oblivious he is getting worse!! The Dems know it-wont admit it. Joe Biden's handlers will find a way to get him out of debating President Trump,
Doesn't Kanye have the right to run for President? He is just another choice for people. I tell people, if you don't like Trump and are concerned about Biden and his mental capacity - write in Kanye, even if he is not on your ballot.
Just saw a reprehensible political ad by Dems. First we had blaming Republicans for throwing Grandma off a cliff now we have one blaming Republicans for killing Grandma off with Covid. Sickening!
Why must I vote for Biden? So he can look bad due to Governors and Dem majors that are gay and weak. No Thank you but had enough of the dems already. Dena Titus will get my vote due to her staff, not her, if I dont get a call back about my PUA &amp; an US Army issue I had back in 198
Hey Biden tweet writer; You're trying too hard. At least make an attempt to make it sound like Joe. (fail)
Downside: nothing ever ends  Upside: reminds me that the republican party must be utterly vanquished and the ground of its ideology salted no matter what precise things are wrong with Joe Biden's brain

That young girl who was very anti Trump until that fake Biden story about him sexually harrassment. She went nuts and now has joined the Anti Anti Trump mafia. She is has become a hero to them
I can understand Biden's comment.  The Latino community is very diverse.  The black community is also diverse but not as much as the Latino community because the black community is united by one goal:  to rid the country of white supremacy and black people's shackles.
SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH JOE BIDEN. His cognitive abilities are nonexistent!

Biden fires back at ‘insecure bully’ Trump after president says he ‘hurt God’ -
I agree at this stage of his dementia its not his fault.  My mother had dementia-they have angry outburst, cant remember, talk about things that never happened etc.  Its obvious Joe Biden is getting worse.
IS ANYONE AS OUTRAGED AS I AM THAT 45 IS GOING ON A 4 DAY GOLFING VACATION?? HE REALLY IS JUST THROWING IT IN AMERICA'S FACE THAT HE DOESN'T GIVE A FUCK IF WE DIE, STARVE, ARE UNEMPLOYED OR HOMELESS.. ANYONE WHO DOESN'T SUPPORT BIDEN NEEDS THEIR HEAD EXAMINED... VOTE OUT DJT. 😩
No way! Biden will never be President if he’s the last person alive ! Trump 2020 and beyond!
Real fact: Biden doesn't know where he is half the time. Does the DNC really think regular folks are gonna vote for him?
Biden is not even fit to serve his VP pick is irrelevant!
joe biden will not push to amend the constitution when we just make restrictions. ban certain weapons. See how that works. So ya it’s absurd he would push for an amendment change.
I know a few "pox on both their houses" third party voters who could conceivably be convinced to vote Biden.  But I think time and effort is better spent driving turnout among Dems than trying to persuade the lunatic fringe to come back to reality.
"Great minds" think alike. Donald and Kanye thought up this half-baked plan to steal votes from Joe Biden. M orons A re G overning A merica
I would act like I really wanted a debate bad, then trump would refuse. Then when trump wants a debate say it’s too late. Trump does more self harm than Biden could ever inflict on him.
We know this isn’t u tweeting Mr. Biden, Ots clear as day and not sincere.
Republicans push Kanye 2020. But will it really hurt Biden?.  via
I know voting biden is going be a possum screaming on top of garbage. I hate this election and just American politics overall. I wish i felt like i had a better 3rd choice
so basically fuck joe biden
Now do Trump. Also, I agree both Biden and Trump have and can be racist at times. Takes a man to own up to it though.

I am a combat veteran of the Vietnam War and an antiwar activist  Hillary Clinton and now Joe Biden voted for the Iraq war  Globalism entails control by multinational corporations and global banks  The Clintons, Obama and Biden are globalists!  I will not vote for Biden or Trump
Don’t think Biden can beat Trump over COVID-19 response cuz anyone can. All you need to do is just listen to Dr. Tony Fauci and you’ll win slowly and painfully.
Kanye is on my last nerve with his bullshit.
I am still voting for Joe Biden. He will be a great President. He will help bring our country back together again. He will let science dictate how to get this pandemic under control. He will govern us consistently and rationally, and he will rebuild our international alliances.
Biden is a Clinton puppet.
Don't listen to the experts or look at the polls. Vote on November 3rd like Joe Biden is way behind!
Text TRUMP to 88022! I stand with
Trump is a liar.  The Trump Campaign will tell lies every day about Joe Biden.  Resist the lies! Vote for Joe on November 3rd!
Text TRUMP to 88022! I stand with   #biden clearly does not understand guns
Text TRUMP to 88022! I stand with    There needs to be an earlier debate than Sept 29 because 16 states have early voting prior to then.
Can't believe this!   Latino community is diverse, ‘unlike the African American community’  CC:
I would pay to watch trump debate Biden on pay per view would you ?
These people are sick yo. But vote for Biden 😂 they should let Trump send the feds in their and shoot all these people
Seriously? What an arrogant remark! –  Latino community is diverse, ‘unlike the African American community’
You mad cause he grabbed pussy ? How many women be grabbing dicks ? Women also have more sexual partners then men. What about trans women and men ? Trans women grab dick everyday ? You think Biden never grabbed pussy? I mean he fought corn pop he definitely grabbed some that day
Oh yeah, I remember when he stated that latinos are rapists and crimminals... Oh, that wasnt Biden 😬🤔
I don’t care how much you tried to push Biden , “EMPATHY” or “HEART” on  that doesn’t feed my family or pay my mortgage !!
Appreciate that, but it’s all good.   I should have left Biden M4A alone. While I do feel  saying he “promised to veto any” is innaccurate, it is true that he has never supported it/it is not likely to pass with him as pres.   I need to get a better understanding of the $ part
Last paragraph say's "And West was eager to criticize Biden, and expressed comfort with the idea of doing damage to the former vice president’s White House chances. “I’m not denying it; I just told you.”
I agree. There’s no point in a debate. We know that Biden is the only choice. I’m not worried about losing, Joe would crush him. Donnie boy won’t answer any question straight up so what’s the point of a debate
What racist comment from  #Biden        #Trump2020Landslide #TrumpThreatensAmerica
Did this mf just say we all the same? Except for a few notable exceptions? Fuck u Joe Biden
Joe Biden will never stop fighting for people of color and never stop listening? 8 YEARS in office as V.P. to a black president and neither of these bozo's did anything of substance, during that time frame, to make substantial changes for the Black community. COME ON MAN!
ALL GLORY TO GOD for your strength and intelligence AND Biden’s STUPIDITY!!! Good will definitely prevail in November 🇺🇸
Are you trying counter Poor old Biden’s daily gaffes?
Maybe you aren’t reading the tweets, he made the joke, I just responded. I know you are blinded by your hate, but Trump is gonna lose. Forget my opinion. Biden is a 2/1 favorite on the largest betting xchange in the world. Better than my or your opinion.
Biden has a plan because he isnt an unqualified bafoon.
Biden: Unlike African-Americans, Latinos Are 'Diverse'
Joe Biden will never debate President Trump! The libs are going to make every excuse in the book! Liberals are the biggest liars in America!
"What you all know but most people don't know, unlike the African American community with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things"-    Gentleman, Joe fucking Biden for you.
Who’s going to be Biden’s pick this week for president 😂😂😂
Tweet my on November 4th, I’ll be happy to admit I was wrong if Biden loses. Trump has lost so much support I do no believe Biden can lose.
I wasn’t trying to get him off the hook. You said he “Promised to Veto M4A”.  I assumed you had a source, I was wrong. It’s funny that you guys say we shouldn’t look for an actual quote after putting words in his mouth.   I know it’s hard for you to accept, but Biden wins easily.
We plan to do just that on November 3. Then we’ll have to fumigate the White House before a real president moves in.   We’ll get the limos, helos and air force one steam cleaned. Then President Biden can strat to rescind all the idiotic things you’ve done. Along with arresting u.
You're absolutely right, the things that Joe Biden says are inexcusable.
Well she's Latina no better race to recruit Latin voters. A lot of people have had a change of heart shows how despicable Trump is.  Symone Sanders former Bernie Sanders spokesperson is an advisor/spokesperson for Biden today. People change necessitated by new circumstances.
Well that’s the most ignorant thing I’ve ever heard. What if you don’t like his VP?  You going to vote for trump?  Who put the most unqualified person he could find in every important position in his administration!  Do us a favor. If you don’t vote for Biden, don’t vote at all!
I’m not a Dem. I’m not afraid of losing. I am quite confident Biden wins easy even though I’m not a huge supporter.   I do feel that HONEST debate is important. Biden never ran on M4A so no he’s not likely to pass it. Clearly Trump won’t either so suggesting he would is crazy.
No one saying they will leave if Biden wins tho 🤣
And if you don't vote for Biden you aint a non-diverse black person
So Sabrina says “Biden has Promised to Veto M4A” and then you suggest I am barking up the wrong tree when I ask fir prof of the promise. Lol.   Maybe, just maybe, if there aren’t clear and direct quotes we shouldn’t represent that a specific promise exists. Wasn’t my statement.
Biden has as many gaffs now as China does people!!!
Nicely said by Biden!!!
Both have a very sketchy history of being racist.

Please, first of if you do not understand the complexities at age 77 when will you, second Biden has been fighting for racism over 40 years. They are both junk candidates out of time and during this critical time, we would need something better than this. The Arctic had 100 F 🙄
Biden sucks
I just was put into twitter jail for calling Joe Biden a lying racist pedophile asshole!
Me? Stop pretending he did.   I supplied the EXACT QUOTE. It absolutely does NOT say that.   You can twist it as much as you want.   In fairness to Biden he didn’t run on M4A. The question itself is reduculous without more info like how it’s gonna be paid for.
You better vote for him. I already told you to stop being ridiculous. Biden has always made gaffes. Big deal.
Ok we get it by now. Biden is🗑️. Trump is💩. But all I see is criticism. Nobody ever mentions legit alternatives.  Howie Hawkins. Jo Jorgensen.  Duopoly won't just disappear. That convo needs to happen. I'd be at peace if I felt US voters voted based on confidence, not fear.
Do what you gotta do. Trump is awful. But don’t look me in the eye and act like Biden is even remotely a good person or candidate. Lets not kid ourselves.
Sir, the fact alone that you defend  that we even talk about this, is insane.  lies, that's it. Done.  So tmr when he claims the sun will never shine again if Biden is elected, do we need a commission and sientists and some research to prove him wrong??
Corn Pop made me say it!   Joe Biden clarifies comments comparing diversity in Latino and African American communities
I don’t think he is listening to his Black staffers. Although Biden has and continues to apologize, he still makes these “Archie Bunker” like racist comments.  He didn’t think he ever did anything wrong. He had Chris Dodd, Ed Rendell and Larry Summers as advisors. Says it all
WATCH: Biden Says Black People Are Not As Diverse As Hispanics. Trump Responds. -
Yeah.  I still cant stand Biden with Barbara Lee next to him.  Besides, if you are on the VP list, then you have already sold out behind the scenes.  If Lee was selected, that would be a stain on her.
Yeah but but but IT IS JUST NOT TRUE. Other than that it’s slll good.  Don’t vote for Biden if you don’t want to, but suggesting Trump is better for health care is pretty reduculous.
If he said it show me because I can’t find it.   What Biden says when asked was "I would veto anything that delays providing the security and the certainty of health care being available now," full quote below.
It wasn't Biden standing in front of a Church with the Bible Cross upside down. That gesture indicates Satan.
Instead of covering for Biden, we to get on his damn campaign to fix the candidate.  Biden is a disaster.
Well thats something made up! How is it? That he put African Americans to work, when Biden and Obama unemployed them for 2 terms, For illegals to work! And also left them homeless.
I dont hate Rice.  Dont know much about her other than she has Pelosi's support (which makes me wary).  I do despise Biden however.  He is my enemy and no VP is going to change that.
Mr. Biden (your trolls) don’t have the right to lecture WE THE PEOPLE on our VOTING RIGHTS! You (your trolls) are nothing but LIARS &amp; EVIL!
Lol so you brought up trump why? Fake news. Joe biden is a pedo
Still better than Biden in a way.  Cant veto #MedicareForAll
Biden is just the lesser of 2 evils. That is 21st century politics.
#BernieSanders calls on #JoeBiden to debate healthcare. Why does Biden think America cannot guarantee healthcare to all citizens? #BernieJoeDebate2020
I don't know much about Kanye West except that people in the comments say he has mental problems. So, it appears that one deranged mind is trying to help another. But anybody who votes for West is not taking the election process seriously. Everything is at stake Nov. 3! Biden 💪!
Biden raises eyebrows with remark contrasting African American, Latino diversity
To be honest, Im not voting for Biden if he selects Rice either.  I cant imagine any VP that would motivate me to vote for him because it wont change his values.
Biden faces backlash for comparing diversity in African American, Latino communities President Trump seized on the comments as "a very insulting statement."
Decided to stalk me huh? Can’t get enough.   Biden may say something racist “on accident”, but Trump will say something racist on purpose. Again. And his supporters will eat it up. Again.

For all my new followers, if you like telling people that they have to vote for Biden because of trump, you're not going to have a good time here. Might want to see yourself out.
You are 100% correct.  Biden was terrible during the Democratic primary debates.  Every interview he made during the pandemic he’s a major offensive and it’s usually against the same Black people that saved his ass in South Carolina.
So for everyone being too negative about it: you're either voting for Biden or you're voting for Trump. And everything in between is a vote for Trump. I'm disheartened by the people who say they won't volunteer or donate if their VP pick isn't chosen. Grow up. 🤦‍♂️
It’s more people than Biden got at his rallies.
Just saw the Biden interview &amp; holy cringe, how did Bernie or Warren not beat this guy? 🤦🏼‍♂️
What gets me is this trends and #TwitterMob #Twits lose their minds but  saying African Americans are not as diverse as Hispanics is perfectly fine. 🙄🤦 #Hypocrisy #SocialismisaMentalDisorder #WalkAwayFromDemocrats

Trump is stupid. Talking badly of Biden is not going to work at all. This country knows Biden very well. Trump is also harping on religion. Biden is a religious man as far as I know. Trump never goes to church. He doesn't want to miss a minute of golf
What person with half a brain would vote for Joe Biden? ...49 years... accomplished zilch.
Biden Fortnite event?  Let's fucking do this.
When Republicans call Kamala Harris a “cop”, mention that Joe Biden once called gang thugs “predators”, and talks about Obama &amp; Rice droning terrorists, I’m not sure what they’re trying to accomplish.
If mumbling incoherent Biden got a pass, you wouldn't be calling him that.
Trump is despicable! Biden is a known as a man faith! Republicans should admonish Trump for this smear!
You’ll do anything to cheat on this election. Biden will never be President
Biden didn’t apologize, he forgot what he said 10 seconds later
I need to see a video of Joe Biden typing this
Of course they have because the Biden folks haven’t been able to keep from running their mouths about the Veepstakes from jump.
you wanna jump on this Biden phonebank with me on Sunday? It only takes an hour. You do it from home.
Wait, what? Quick five minute research or even YouTube search, there’s a plethora of bad prejudice, if not fully racist clips and quotes from DT.   Not excusing Biden, but please don’t say that one is, and one isn’t - that just not truthful. They both have warts, here.
CatholicVote Calls on Joe Biden to Condemn Attacks on Sacred Symbols   Joe Biden doesn't control anything. He is an empty suit. The people controlling Joe will never condemn it.
It would be funny if it happened.
He apologized, something trump never does. Biden has always been clumsy w/his words but he's not a racist.
Wow you really swayed me. I'm gonna change my vote to  Biden now
yall worried about Kanye mental health look no futher than Biden 🤣
Stop telling us that we're not allowed to criticize Kanye because mental illness. "West [...] expressed comfort with the idea of doing damage to the former vice president’s White House chances. 'I’m not denying it; I just told you.'"
After Biden does a little interview does he spend the rest of the day getting his foot out of his mouth?
The enthusiasm for Joe Biden in Michigan is high. He won 73 of the 125 delegate votes with 52.9% of the votes. Bernie got 36.4% &amp; others got 10.7%.   Meanwhile, Trump won 93.7% of the Republican vote.
Don’t think I’d want a President that was afraid to go anywhere. They say COVID could be around for many more months would Biden move the Oval Office to the basement?
Progressives have already convinced themselves that Biden is the devil and they're not voting for him. He's been working w/Bernie on very progressive policies but it's never enough for them.
I'm sorry but "Biden has a stutter" doesn't cut it for all the problems he has. I'll vote for him but I'm not going to pretend that he's some great candidate because he's just not. If he wins, it's because Trump is just that horrible. We had better options but Ds wanted JB, so...
I had a really emotional phonebank today.  First, someone screams at me that Biden wants the country to be run by Moo-slems and "Democrats are taking away the First Amendment," and then I get someone who tells us that she has no food and her rural food bank is out of food.
A fact checker, Jonathan Swan as the moderator and the ability to turn off Trump's mic while Biden is answering a question.
Biden is above the law.  #HidenBiden #DemocratsAreCorrupt  Joe Biden's family racks up arrests for drugs, drunk driving — but no jail time  via
Huge difference when Trump gives hours long speeches and messes up a word or two. Biden can’t complete a sentence without stumbling. He’s clearly deteriorating
Just got off the phone with an ex co-worker in LA TV days back in 80’s. He’s now in DC Politics. He says Biden is like silly putty. DNC are twisting him in any direction they see fit. But he still has the mental acuity of a PET ROCK!
Since when does the VP lead the country? Pence is not in charge. Trump is! Wtf? smh #TrumpIsLosing  and you should chose the right side of history. #Biden and whomever he picks should be the next to lead.
.....  and there are several other things that could be said. Greed and division and corruption brought our country to the brink of being destroyed by God DIDNT Biden have 8 years to stop it ? I’m a supporter of America and whoever our leader is, and now it is Trump and I dont
Trump is scared silly of Biden. Why is he bringing God into the picture? What kind of believers are those, who think God can be destroyed by one man?
Democrats need to re-erect Sleepy Joe Biden before he can be elected !
My issues with Biden go deeper than this. But we're stuck with him so I hope for the best.
You. Are. Being. Exploited. Get yourself out of this mess, apologize and endorse Joe Biden, and you *may* salvage some of your personal dignity.
Because Biden will. To be the nominee
I will never forgive the democratic establishment for ramming Joe Biden down our throats when absolutely nobody wanted him
LMAO - biden has nothing to worry about
Really?  You’d not vote for Biden if you don’t like his VP pick?  Well, then you’re obviously voting for Trump.  To not vote is a vote for Trump. Please put your country ahead of your personal feelings.  This democracy will not survive another 4 years of Trump!
If Joe Biden (or any Democrat of note, really) had made this mistake, Dinesh would be among the first to make fun of them for it.

Joe Biden really is an old school racist. His history bears it out. Now that he has dementia, his mental filters are gone, and what he really thinks just blurts out.
I would love for Trump banning TikTok by executive order to be the first question of the first debate with Biden.  Just imagine.
Joe Biden said he could take God. It’s on.
Bill is on Biden levels of color commentary these days
Biden will have to debate three times...assuming his dementia allows it...I was trying to stay out of politics today, but Biden is such an entitled never had a real job in the private sector idiot...the good news, his "apology" is getting ratioed to hell on Twitter...👍✌
Joe Biden would never in his life have said the things Trump said about him. The man belongs in the White House. Trump belongs in the jailhouse.
No chemistry between Biden and Harris,  Rice, Whitmer or Warren would be better picks.
Um you're too late on that one Biden.
Biden is a moderate Republican.  You own the Democratic Party.
Democrats have many organizations inside and outside the country.  Specifically communist organizations around the world.  The radical left across the world is backing Biden right now.  I didn't mean to say that Biden is radical, but his party is hijacked by radicals.
Trump said Two Corinthians. I think it is hilarious that anyone would try to paint Biden as less Christian than Trump 😂
This is what I get for repeating Biden’s plans back to someone lol Hi Putin?
Biden apologized. Trump openly supports the confederacy and is trying to take away my right to vote. Biden 2020.
Nigga Obama was a shit president. Yeah we had healthcare but no one had jobs or money. He had weapons and soldiers in places they didn’t need to be. Biden is senile and just going to be lead by Obama. Both choices are awful might as well watch Kayne fuck it up 💁🏽‍♂️
Biden "lives by the Bible." Bible-lovin' Biden. What next from Democrats?
Either Biden will show a significant cognitive decline or he won’t. Either way, this election’s debate(s) will effect the election more than in the past.
Looking for a reason NOT to vote for Biden?
Tell me Democrats, did you nominate Biden because of his dementia or the fact he is racist...just wondering... #DementiaJoe #JoeBidenIsARacist #JoeBiden #Democrats #JoeBidenForPresident2020 #JoeBidenRacist #JoeBiden2020 #DemocraticParty
This - word for word - should be a Biden ad
I think if Biden does do the tweet they should sign the tweet. It’s almost like fake news, we are not actually hearing from Biden. And many people believe that Biden is up at 3am tweeting and putting g together a coupe of sentences! Trump I would believe!!
Yeahhhh that’s Biden’s plan. $15 by 2026. Hes 100% not overturning death penalty, overturning citizens united, eliminating private prisons. He made it possible to not be able to file bankruptcy for student loans. He’s against weed legalization in 2020. LOL FOH
Not sure what there is to debate, Trump is liable for some percentage of 160K dead Americans (the only thing debatable is the exact percentage) Biden is not, Trumps platform is “only I can fix it” yeah, how did that work out....  Biden gaffes, literally that’s his only issue
If Trump said anything close to what Biden said CNN and Other fake news would hold one hour breaking news special. Nancy and Chuckie would impeach him!
Practicing Catholics in good standing violate doctrine all day long and never face any consequences or questions. Biden is an easy target.  I hear pedophilia is against Catholic Doctrine as well, maybe the Church should clean up its own house.

My first choice for VP has always been Elizabeth Warren. Biden is a moderate, and Warren is a progressive. I think though that Biden is being advised to select a black woman such as Kamala Harris or Karen Bass. No matter who the VP is though, I'm for Joe.
Trump will now slander Joe Biden every day, all day. Ignore him, and vote for Joe on November 3rd.
Does anyone with an IQ above 12, believe the “walk back” tweet from  where he said blacks had “no diversity of thought” was actually authored by Biden? He wouldn’t even be able to read that walk back without stumbling, so he certainly couldn’t have written it.
Fuck Biden and FUCK TRUMP. I said what I said. Now checkout the Queen Jo Jorgensen!!!

Lol, not even close, Delusional Biden doesn’t stand a chance. But keep thinking that, as long as it helps you feel alittle better for the next 3 months! 👍
People like Mikey don't want to face the fact that Democrats have a long, sordid history of racism. From the Confederacy to the KKK, from Jim Crow to being against the Civil Rights Act. He also ignores that "kids in cages" is well documented from the Obama-Biden administration.

Biden could say the most racist thing ever, then later go, "guys I misspoke. Pretend I don't really think the things I told you."
Biden apologized today. Trump openly supports the confederacy.
Guess what I don't understand, how someone who claims to be anti corrupt and anti racism could vote for Biden. You really should look in to Biden. He's the one who supported segregation not Trump. He made racist comments just this morning.
Joe Biden is not fit to be President.. Although I am now a Trump supporter-I voted twice for Obama. President Obama was mentally fit to be President, He was not a terribly President. He had magic, President Trump has magic!! President Clinton had magic. Joe Biden has no magic.

Why don’t you comment on what Biden said today,or at least what he tried to say.He was being both a jerk and racist and you don’t seem to want to talk about it.He can only spew a couple words at a time and they’re always racist or mean, if you can even understand him..

About what an awesome POTUS  IS and abt all the criminal investigations &amp; charges/indictments coming from our new AG's office! And abt how cool it was to watch Biden sign all those exec. orders, restoring the Obama ones &amp; about his NEW SCOTUS picks. Stuff like that!🥰👍
Biden just needs to stay out of the public eye. With quotes like this they might not vote at all.   “Unlike the African-American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community"
Right but that now Joe Biden is brain dead we have no idea what he agreed to and what he did not agree to?   We are all just praying his brain transplant works after the recent lobotomy did not yield results!
Biden about a month ago said he gets tested "all the time," and now says he is never tested. Glad we cleared that up.
Don't worry if Biden is elected there will be Medicare or Medicaid for all and then the Government Death Panels will offer you a permanent solution to your disability and it won't cost you or any of us anything!   Yay Liberal Democrats!!!!

Exactly right! And any apostate like Biden being refused the sacraments is a frAud. But then that gives him street cred with the Marxist Democrats

People keep posting negative things about Biden and trump like they actually vote in the first place. Stop posting about politics if you don’t vote! If you want to start to plan to learn a little more before being influenced by these tactics you keep posting.
Yes are talking about black people in American and not what you see on TV. Actual black americans are  a diverse community and  people who are not intellectually neutered know this. Those who depend on the media for their information agree with nit witted Biden.

Ok. Find me one, just one time EVER, Trump has correctly quoted A Bible verse. I’m sure it exists but I can’t find it. Lol.   Biden was easy tho:   Trump is playing Christians like a fiddle, and it’s sad.
Regardless a voter is not going to be mobilized via derision. It won't demobilize a potential Trump voter or mobilize a potential Biden voter.  I cannot stand being coerced to vote for Biden and yet I have heard compelling framing to do so. This isn't it, my dude!
This is the closest I ever came to Joe Biden. 😁  After asking if the man next to me, in a Tom Steyer shirt, and I were "together", I laughed and said "No, but we're all in it together right?"  He pointed at my Pete flair and said "That's a good guy" and smiled.  My Joe Story ❤
Just think, IF Biden wins, Dems will finally have that Racist in the Whitehouse they've been talking about.  Joe Biden remarked in interview released Thurs “unlike the African American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community."An incumbent  at 41% approval who can’t campaign on their own accomplishments is probably not going to get re-elected. Maybe it’s time for Rudy to accuse Hunter Biden of some more crimes?
Russia again? No one needs help denigrating Biden.  He does it entirely on his own.  Try looking at China instead...
So you wanna share your opinion on why Biden saying the Black vote is a monolith is a problem and differs from what you just said there sport?
The best part is Biden can’t stop saying stuff like this daily!!
Biden is NOTHING but a straight up racist, ALWAYS was, ALWAYS will be. ANY "news" entity covering for him ARE closet racists. ANY Black Americans promoting/ voting for him IS making money for THEMSELVES and does NOT care one bit to do ANYTHING for poor Black Communities. HELLO?
IANAL but still least this makes it easier for Biden’s people to challenge his name on the ballot.
Subjects Trump wants to talk about: confederate flags, NFL kneeling, water pressure, Biden hates God  Subjects Trump DOESN’T want to talk about: 160,000 deaths, 15% unemployment

Damn the Biden ads write themselves.  Biden does not have to do anything but let the idiot speak and remind us the #GOP is allowing our country to be in ruins.
Biden bad! Hurt God! Me smart, yeah me smart. Biden bad, hurt God.  I didn't hear it but I'm paraphrasing.
Weird that the human embodiment of the Seven Deadly Sins would be so concerned about Biden's faith.
Biden could choose a concussed, rabid squirrel as a running mate and he'd be a better choice than Trump.  Why would anyone take advice from someone who can't recognize the existential threat that 4 more years of Trump poses to this country - and the world?
Biden has plenty of time. Hillary announced Tim Kaine on August 20, 2016.
Framing Hunter Biden won’t work because the US economy shrunk by 32% in the last quarter, unemployment is at 15%, and 160,000 Americans died because the incumbent President is unfit for office
These dumb allegations are getting increasingly more pathetic. Trump will soon be reduced to accusing Joe Biden’s father of murdering JFK

A couple decades ago, Trump used to be a competent grifter capable of executing a good con  These days he’s reduced to trying to convince voters that Joe Biden will fire every police officer in America, burn all the Bibles, and ban suburbia. These lies are completely unpersuasive
Additionally, Joe Biden has stated he can't wait to debate trump!
is doing everything he can to keep Trump from being re-elected. Even if it just means keeping happy Conservatives off his platform so they are frustrated, it helps him push Braindead Biden

This is so true. I’m seeing so many strong Democratic African American females in politics. I’m personally hoping Kamala Harris will be selected as Vice President to Joe Biden.
Hunter Biden isn’t on the ballot. I don’t spend much time thinking about Hunter Biden. I spend a LOT of time thinking about the pandemic, though.

I don't get the logic. You'd have to be out of your mind to vote for Kanye. And that's Trump's demographic, not Biden's.
In their mind, Biden is the lesser evil. I'm not so sure about that tbh, he might be even more dangerous than Trump, given the ease to manipulate his cognitive mental state,
Telling you. Do not be deceived by Establishment Democrats. Over half of the Bernie platform incorporated into the DNC platform will never see the light of day if Biden wins.
3 points that shape my thinking on this election:  Point 1: Donald Trump is a dangerous sociopath who is unfit for office &amp; needs to be removed immediately.  Point 2: It’s *possible* that Joe Biden is getting senile.  Point 3: Point 1 is far more important than Point 2.
Isn't it  racist and sexist for Joe Biden to say he's going to pick a black female for his VP? Could you imagine the backlash if President Trump said he was picking a white old man for his VP? Whatever happened to the most qualified person.🤔
Taxes are not going up by 4 trillion under President Biden! But, the wealthy will finally be paying their fair share of taxes instead of being given all the tax cuts by the current idiot in the WH!

Does Joe Biden know who or where Joe Biden is?
What? Do you think they're stupid? They know this is all crap! And they're voting for Biden! You have zero chance of changing that now!
My first thoughts are Liz Warren for Treasury and Cory Booker for AG. Booker has a mixed record but he focused on reforming criminal justice in his campaign.  There might be better options out there but considering it’s Biden those would be decent choices.
For 50 years, Joe Biden has destroyed lives through his racist, elitist ideology.  And you now you want to reward him with the Presidency?   Trump is not a racist, but most Dems in DC are pedophiles.  #MAGA #KAG #WWG1WWGA
Here’s the thing. Presidents do not simply make decisions by themselves. They are surrounded by some of the top experts in every field. Not only will Biden have the same access to those voices, he will listen. Also a direct phone line to  is priceless.  #YesWeCanAgain
Despite Michelle Obama’s repeat denials that she’ll one day run for office, Jason Chaffetz remains confident that she will be Joe Biden’s VP pick.

He knows he's going to lose. The more he bitches, the more desperate he is. But, he's also vengeful..if he's getting the boot, he's going to leave as big a mess behind as he can just to spite us, but especially to spite Joe Biden.
When we watch YOUR Fake Ads, we think, "President Joe Biden is going to be such a welcomed change! #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica
I agree! Somehow they will keep Biden out of the debates.
To  Say it with me: President Joe Biden President Joe Biden President Joe Biden President Joe Biden President Joe Biden President Joe Biden President Joe Biden President Joe Biden You need to start getting used to that.
...cluttered than it was 4 yrs. ago. THE MOST RECENT CO. TO GET THE AD IN MY HOME? ALL THINGS AMAZON! That multi million dollar boost Amazon JUST GAVE to the ANTI AMERICAN BIDEN CAMPAIGN WAS THE LAST STRAW! I would NEVER call for others to boycott as that is what the PETTY LEFT..
Lord help you if this guy wins.  Forget everything bad i ever said about Ben McAdams (and Joe Biden) the alternatives are SO much worse.
JOE - as in Biden
Regardless, it is still President Trump. Biden wins the polls and the popular vote and Trump wins the Electoral College, you happy with that?
If he is losing to Biden and the polls are correct, then why are the Dems going nuts trying to establish national mail in ballots, why are they panicking about the ability of the USPS to handle the mail in ballots.  Trump is going to win.
Trump spoke to members of the City of New York Police Benevolent Association, the union representing some 24,000 rank-and-file officers as he steps up his attacks on Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris.
You Do realize Joe Biden is trying to say he and obama deserve most of the credit for this deal?
Let's just remember that because if Biden will win then the idea is probably also appealing to him right along with slashing Social Security.
Ah, our country is collapsing NOW!  Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris will be a refreshing change.
Wonder if the $48M Biden/Harris received in 48 hours was funneled thru BLM?
Basement Biden and Dems are so dead. They just don’t know it yet. No one is voting FOR riots, looting &amp; burning, or low income housing in suburbs. No one.
Women are not given chances to redeem themselves like men. Kanye is working the GOP to sabotage Biden, wore Confederate flags, supports Trump, ect yet he still receives a lot of support. Meanwhile Azealia banks was blacklisted for antics. I will continue to support Doja Cat 1/2

They will continue to Hide Biden from mics and cameras questions and debates as much as possible to keep his obvious dementia and racism down to a minimum. Extremely weak ticket. Just going through the motions.
Only those who do not NOT know how to read, research and figure out the truth will vote for Biden.  Wake up!  🤯 #Trump2020
What’s at stake: fixing America (Biden) or revolution (Trump). Republicans should announce at the convention that you Mikey are the nominee. You would be a way better choice than Traitor Bloody Donny.
Mass exodus if Biden elected ? Belize get ready for some money !!
So by that logic, you’d better not be voting for Joe Biden and Kampala Harris...🤔

I feel like my high school class president did a better job campaigning than Joe Biden did.
Trump will go to prison after he loses to Biden!

Apparently Twitter is now censoring calling Biden s e n i l e. But... he obviously is, so... 🤷🏼‍♀️
This pandemic has killed Vegas! Biden will sell out to China
No one is pointing out what the spiced together words it has Biden saying. Did you hear the part about children? It’s sick
I will probably vote for  for ballot access, and because she is the closest to my values. I will also vote against ballot initiatives that spend money, or outlaw a noncrime... But, if Nevada goes for Biden, and he invades Syria, I'll feel guilty 🤷
Mostly state not federal issues but I wouldn't expect Biden to know that. Renters rights already exist in most states. Check out how the federal sexual assault survivors bill of rights was passed. As usual, had very little to do with the president at the time (Trump).
What’s worse is the words spliced together to make Biden say something dirty about children.
Biden and Harris thanks you for all of the donations
322 times in 60 days??? So he was going to his basement 5 times a day...  I have been out my house 4 times since beginning of march....  I probably walk through my house 100 times a day...   I don't get their point   I hear Biden every day: TV, twitter, emails, text, zoom, etc
He’s cut taxes so we get more money on paychecks. He’s built the wall like he said. He’s dropped prices of medical supplies. Created more jobs. Unemployment at an all time low until COVID. Biden has been in politics 40 years and done nothing.
I'm very curious what some, possible Biden voters think about this...        If Biden invades Syria, in 2021, and nothing else changes... You were conned by the greater evil, right?
I mean..   ... Do you actually believe this insanely optimistic estimate?  Trump went 4 years without starting a new immoral war of choice as president... Obama didn't with Biden as Veep. Did Biden ever complain?  I'm pretty sure Biden still gets me 20k Syrians dead+
I'll wait while you find the quote from Biden 'hollering' about closing flights to China.  The racist calling started when he extended the ban to some African countries for no reason (they still have nowhere near as many cases as us) a couple of weeks later, because it was racist

The USPS Workers Union has endorsed Biden. Conflict of interest wouldn’t you say?
Soooo what you’re saying is you’d rather vote AGAINST Trump rather than FOR Biden? And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how a republic dies a slow death. Biden is doing as little as possible and thinks it will be enough to earn the highest office in the world. I don’t think so.
On betonline Biden is -135, Trump is +1.05. They have odds on each state too. FL -1.55 Dem, AZ -145 Dem, etc. Based on state odds, here is how EC map looks. Biden easy winner.
FWIW, betonline has odds:  -135 Biden, +105 Trump. Was -180 Biden last week. Doesn't make sense as they have odds for each state. Biden in -155 FL, -145 AZ, etc. Based on state odds, here is EC map. Biden wins easy.

I personally don’t dislike him, he has debated some right winger and completely smashed them, but when debating other leftists, well, it’s a lot messier. Rn I think he’s getting a lot of flak because of his support for Biden and using Marxist theory uphold his position
Truthfully - he has spent his entire life dividing this great country of ours - and adding you to the ticket, will only further that divide!  BTW:  you were so certain about your low opinion in Biden, what changed your mind?  🤔

Except FedEx is aloud to open any package they want meaning they can open voting mail if it went through them and just throw out ones for Biden to skew the votes. USPS is not aloud to open private mail
22 emails from Biden's campaign today with 6+ hours still to go.
He signed to executive orders to force the Democratic leader back to negotiate a fair bill for America. He is a great negotiator, unlike Biden he can spell it!
CCP and the Kuomintang hated each other but came together to fight Japanese Imperialism, once they won that conflict they got back to vying on who was going to run the country. So are you so disillusion that you think 4 more years of Trump will make your life than with Biden/Harr

Shove your statue. I want universal health care, pro-choice, a fucking functional USPS, expanded unemployment benefits, increased CV19 testing, a coherent CV19 plan based on SCIENCE, protection of SS and Medicare, no more nepotism, and Biden as Pres.
You have to prove Biden is harm reduction. From historical analysis we can say that’s definitely not a thing to accept as a given.
As usual you are awesome Rose💙💙💙💙
The double standard the media has for Biden and trump is astonishing.  Biden has to be perfect; trump, no.
Biden/Harris is closer to my values then Trump. Not a 100% which nothing ever is. Obama wasn't but definitely more than Romney and McCain could ever be. Revolutions invariable have counter revolutions but 2 parties come together to fight an enemy despised by both. 1/2
Neoliberal actions such as trying to get us to vote for fucking Biden in place of organizing actual direct action is what made you my enemy, dummy.

Best voter database, Catalist, shows non-whites were 24% of 2016 turnout. So to get Biden up by 11, they had to oversample minorities by 13 pts.  Pollsters rig by undersampling whites, oversampling young, oversampling women, oversampling college grad+, usually a combo.
Shooting straight won’t do a lot of good when Biden takes away your guns while setting the Bible on fire on his way to hurt God.  Isn’t funny how scared these tough guys are?

Wow just basically got told to shut up about politics because I'm an immigrant by an ex Bernie campaign staffer (who I referred to the campaign) because I won't support Joe Biden. Damn she is a confused mess. LOL
According to Catalist, which studies have shown is most accurate on voter data, non-whites were 24% of 2016 turnout.  Every pollster showing Biden with a lead is undersampling whites by 7 pts or more.
You can hypothesize all you want but Biden’s actions directly gave the police authority to kill PoC indiscriminately, you don’t get to use utility as a bargaining chip. You have to admit you are using arbitrary ideas to select one equivalent evil over another. It means nothing.
Is that why rapist Biden takes and answers so many questions?
I think everyone appointed by Trump should go to jail when Biden crushes him
I'm being honest - I'm not thrilled with these options, I'm more left than Biden or Harris.  Im literally just asking what makes the most tactical sense? And what will help the most people RIGHT NOW?

why don’t you just call them Mr Biden, and Miss Harris. Try this instead of just insulting those running against you and actually discuss policies. Wait I understand you don’t have any policy other than cutting taxes for the Ultra Rich. That and erasing Pr.Obama.
It's as crowded as a Joe Biden rally. 😀
Biden is the candidate because nobody was willing to step away so Pete could finish Bernie, starting with NH which the press somehow made a 3 way race with Amy. I don’t know anything anymore after this fucking primary.

I literally just saw a quote from Biden taking partial credit for this. Ridiculous!
Are you talking about the same usps that officially endorsed biden? The same usps that biden is telling President Trump is out to destroy? The primary ballots I received, (6 for a house w/2 registered voters) had party affiliation on the envelope. Nope!
Obama, Biden as well.
He probably shouldn't unless his internal polling show it a reasonably close race.  If he does make a play, it will scare the shit out of the Biden campaign, force them to spend money there, and spread Joe and Kamala....ahem...thin.
I’m also not a fan of Biden, but hasn’t tRump done enough damage already? He had his shot, he drove our nation to the ground. He’s done. Why is that so hard to understand?
We have built a criminal legal system specifically designed to oppress people of color???  You’re 100% right, both you and Biden have been in the politics for like 40 years! So give yourself a pat on the back for your racist policies! 😂🤣😂 freakin 🤡
Joe Biden: "We are better than this moment than we are in."
Okay so you are voted for racist Joe Biden in good concise. Make that one make sense?
Our kids have been in cages since Biden wrote the crime bill bitch, what have you done to stop that?
Yes. This is what leftists mean when they say “voting Biden is harm reduction” It’s not “vote Biden then stop everything we’re doing” It’s “vote Biden so less people die while we keep pushing, even harder.”
Someone telling you that you are wrong is not cyber bullying Jacqueline
In the NV primary I received 6 ballots with only 2 registered voters in the house. They also had a checkbox on the outside of the envelope for party affiliation. The USPS union has endorsed biden and all the leftists are screeching that potus is trying to destroy the USPS. 🤔
I know y’all don’t like Fox News I can get you a different source 👀 or 👁👄👁
Reuters/Ipsos poll sample is 50% Democrat-leaning, only 37% GOP leaning, to get Biden to +7.  Biden is down bigly, not just a couple of points.
In 2012 I was working out of state and had to prove to NV that I was by sending a pay stub from my employer in UT to get a ballot. What they want to do is send ballots out like those landscaping service flyers you get every day in your mailbox. USPS endorsed biden. It’s a scam.

If Trump can have his acceptance speech in the White House then the DNC should request that Biden should be able to have his in the White House. He is a former Vice President after all. Equal time.
You’re correct, and he has broken the law so many times no one could keep track.  There’s nothing Biden &amp; Harris could do to come close.  I don’t want to hear complaints from magats.  I can play “what about,” too.
I’m serious, I just can’t take black folks voting for Biden serious, when his track record is well known. Voting for him is literally the definition insanity.

It is good to know that  mail carriers who endorsed Joe Biden for president will be handling my mail in ballot. I'm sure they will be honest.
So excited for Biden-Harris!
Biden should be nervous, we now know he was involved in FBI LYING to get a warrant. Biden and Comey hopefully will see for prison time. More coming soon!!

I believe the specific words he said was "In certain cases" which is way different than the blanket bill Biden wrote.
Yes he did.  At that time, he explained his vote (women domestic abuse provisions, if I remember), trashed the part resulting in mass incarceration, and SPENT HIS LIFE TRYING TO FIX.  Biden/Harris still embrace that bill to this day.
Hell, they're already calling Joe Biden a commie, and he's about as conservative as the Dems come  What makes anyone think the black lady cop who once endorsed M4A is going to attract people who think Joe Biden was pals with Joe Stalin

No.  I blaming her for supporting, endorsing, and exectuting Biden's crime bill, which is RACIST.  I dont care if you blame Biden for it instead of her.  In the end, voting for them as a team is supporting that same racism.  It makes you complicit.

Joe Biden Picks Kamala Harris As Running Mate #BidenHarris2020
Mr President Pervy Joe Biden just tweeted this. People are losing their homes. Millions have already lost their paychecks. Our country is in crisis. The virus isn’t taking a break — Republicans shouldn’t either. The House did their job. President Trump, bring the Senate back.Done
How many followers does Biden have ?
I don’t get political in my tweets but I would prefer  as #POUS over Biden/Harris or Trump/Pence I am not thrilled at all with our choices for November #elections
UNBELIEVABLE!  And it's true. Check it out.
Oh boy.  I love these polls that exclude the Green party.  Our goal is to get them to 10%.  Which would make it:  Trump: 45% Biden: 43% Green: 10%  What a shame.  #WeWarnedYou
Biden campaign will host virtual watch parties to engage supporters as Democratic National Convention goes almost entirely virtual
Hate Trump all you want because he isnt political correctness in your eyes but this business man took over White House and get a lot of things done for the Americans. Now look what Biden and Kamalas have done together ??? Name one successful policy they helped Americans
Bottom line.   I will do whatever to vote for Biden/Harris in November.
you guys are all fucking stupid if you think joe biden and kamala are winning this next election lmfaoo
Actually, Biden informed the public of what the medical community has suggested. He’s requesting all Governor’s to listen to the exerts, who’ve stated “A 3 month mask mandate, will save the lives of 40k people” ✌🏻💙🇺🇸
The Biden campaign says thank you.
And Biden will propose giving them more money
To those claiming Biden “has no policy...”  STOP IT  He has made it clear that as president he will be the former vice president.
Trump ‘oozes a lack of confidence’ since Biden picked Harris as his running mate: columnist

Hi Don, i enjoy the show.  I have a different idea for a debate that would be good for the election.  I would like to see Kamala debate Trump and Biden debate Pence.   What do you think?  Can this happen?

The Biden campaign really has zero shame in blatantly lying to the American people.   Trump is not going to defund Social Security.   Listen here:
We caught them. The Obama Administration (INCLUDING JOE BIDEN) illegally spied on Trump! If you vote for the these corrupt Democrats, you deserve the evil they will force upon you!
Ok - fair point. But that has little to do with the actual election. I know that the Constitution is very clear about Trump's term ending at 12:01pm on Jan 20. Biden said he'd have him dragged out if necessary.
GO VOTE! But, to be honest, even if Biden wins by a convincing margin, Trump is going to whine like the baby he is.
Wish you were right but MA and CA and NY for starters will have 125% voter participation for Biden  .........................
Holy cow. The blatant lies just keep on coming from the Biden campaign.   They have zero shame in lying to the American people.

Joe Biden dodges every question and you have been pushing a bogus conspiracy theory since January 2017.  Go fk yourself.
I don't like it. But I'm not going to advocate not voting at all. I don't even see it as voting for Biden/Harris. I see it as vote for taking Senate, letting RBG fucking retire, prosecuting Trump, saving DACA/ACA/LGBT rights, protecting courts, COVID action, removing DeVos/Miller
Yeah...I can definitely see a lot of queer and non-white people not voting this year because of the Biden/Harris ticket and at this point can you blame them? It’s four more years of stagnation either way and we don’t have a lot of the privileges to fall back upon.
You are making the incorrect moral choice as you are predicating your argument on a assumption that Biden is any better than trump which you have failed to provide evidence for.
Hard to believe Biden/Harris has officially been a ticket to run for the President and VP for 48 hours and neither candidate has taken a single question from a journalist. That’s got to be a first.
Because  1) the thread is about not voting Biden and 2) the what about you just used to try to refocus the conversation on trump can absolutely be said about Biden- He’s very into cutting social programs and would do so immediately once in.   Direct action is what fixes it.
I have a hard time with that because Biden won the primaries with many states having record turnout, especially among southern black voters. I wasn't happy about it either, but that's how shit went. So now it's time to let the fascist roll over everybody?
Trump's events in Mankato, Minnesota, and Oshkosh, Wisconsin, are being billed as remarks on Biden's “failures on Jobs and the Economy.”
Biden announced he is going to expand Medicare coverage and drop the eligibility age to 60. Also that he is going to look at forgiving student loan debt to ppl making less than $125k per year. He has made moves more to the left Also, if Biden doesn't win the Supreme Court is lost
Honestly I think all these polls showing Biden’s lead are all skewed. Unless we can seriously bring out the vote in the swing states, I think Trump will surprise everyone again in November

One heck of a quote here: “I’m dealing with this brutal stuff, dog-eat-dog in school, and then I would come home and we would all stand by the toilet and wave bye to a piece of shit,” Harris recalled in 2018. “It will put this place in perspective.”

The DNC knows Biden wouldn't make it a full year if elected. They know that the liberals wouldn't vote for a black(?) woman to be POTUS. (they wouldn't in the Primary). So stick her in as a placeholder VP and shoot for the vagina/black sympathizer vote. Pray for a win by default.

I was going more to “Biden chose a slut that blew her way up the political chain”- but that AJ comment is pretty good...
Biden’s consistent and recent language only demonstrates his deep seated polarization of minorities calling them not diverse thinkers or not a very diverse group. “Ain’t black” isn’t exactly Progressive, it’s Regressive.
Don't forget that Biden is practically brain dead!

Get a clue! If Biden was in charge there would have been millions of people killed. He denigrated Trump’s closing of travel with China/Europe. Biden never would have closed borders or the economy and millions more would have died. Just like Cuomo killed thousand in NY rest homes.

I just love this imagery from the Biden/Harris campaign. Joe said all along that he wanted a partner rather than an underling and the campaign has really presented Kamala as an equal during the roll out and she has the natural gravitas to pull it off.
Biden will be destroyed...that’s whats to know
Obama and Biden Little League
The real numbers for the election are coming in. And it’s not good for Biden/harris. Expect this on the daily
$hillary wants to be close to her pupil Harri$, so she can show her the best way to stab Biden in the back!
But when $hillary decided in those last two weeks not to visit WI, MI, OH, and PA, three if which she’d NEVER stepped foot in during the General campaign, THAT’S what doomed her! People DON’T vote for those who don’t court them!  Biden WON’T make that mistake!
and NOW crooked Hillary is begging 'ol Joe for a job.  Folks if you DON'T #VOTEGOP and Biden gets elected, you're not getting JUST Sleepy Joe, you would be getting a coalition of nightmares that will DESTROY AMERICA!  #leadright #battlebornred
China attacked us with a bioweapon.  It's appropriate to identify that bioweapon by the country that attacked us.  Asian Americans are diverse and they not responsible for China's crimes.  You probably thought they were monolithic--same way Biden sees blacks.
did you ask Ms, Gordon if she would come back when Biden wins?
Conspiracy theory... you mean like the Russiagate conspiracy theory you peddled for four years?  Or the Ukrainegate conspiracy theory you peddled to impeach Trump while Biden conspired with Porochenko to steal $40 billion?  Like that?
HOORAY!!!  I'm with Fightin' Biden and Nasty! Make Democracy and the Rule of Law Great Again!
The Senate is our number 1 priority.  Without the Senate, Trump doesn't get free a free pass to do whatever he wants. He can be truly investigated, and impeached (with a real trial).  I will vote for Biden, and I will donate to down-ballot Dems.  This country is worth it.
HAR!!!  I'm with Fightin' Biden and Nasty! Make Democracy and the Rule of Law Great Again!
Do not overlook that it was  that gave the conspiracy theory its footing.  My print subscription is up in Sept. I've already stopped the automatic renewal.  Without a full, unbridled apology, I'll simply walk away from the once-responsible magazine.  #Biden chose well.
CURIOUS:  Do you think Biden having a woman as VP will increase the number of women who will vote democratic?
Ignoring policy, Biden sounds like a normal human being who cares about others while Trump sounds like a psychotic idiot who only cares about himself. So why would anyone vote for him? RACISM. They’re willing to forgive/forget everything else including democracy.
Biden did build jobs like crazy in China 🇨🇳 it is a pandemic with a closed nation u did not want because it was racist to shut borders down remember come down to China 🇨🇳 town genius we just had a million plus jobs added to the economy in a pandemic with a closed border
Biden expands lead over Trump to double digits: poll
Why do  &amp; crew never question the eligibility of white candidates? Why haven't they asked to see Biden's birth certificate? #Republicans will question every single non-white, non-Republican candidate's citizenship from now on, thanks to Trump, and racism.
Biden supporters against Trump are very enthusiastic.

Why does Nancy Pelosi spit and drool. Why does Joe Biden forget everything and say racist things to black interviewers?
No. Bought and paid for by Soros and the DNC and apparently Joe Biden since his website comes straight from the Antifa site.
1. Biden is more in the center than the State of Kansas.  That's *after* shifting left.  2. Good, we need higher taxes on those earning over $1mil/yr.  3. They're not going to enact universal healthcare, the corporate sponsors of the DNC would never allow it.

I surely hope your polls are more accurate. I honestly NC an not fathom anyone voting FOR Biden. These people are just voting against trump.

Right-wing news sites appear to sync racist messaging with the Trump campaign in attack against Biden -

Joe Biden says America needs a national face mask mandate "starting immediately."  via
(RNS) — Kamala Harris filled two criteria that Joe Biden wanted in a running mate: She is a woman and she is Black, two critical Democratic constituencies ahead of the November elections.But
WASHINGTON (CNS) — Joe Biden’s choice of Sen. Kamala Harris, D-California, as his vice presidential running mate elicited broad smiles from key black Catholics. Others, though, started criticizing her record nearly as soon as the pick was publicized Aug.
NCR recently profiled two prominent Catholic politicians, Attorney General William Barr and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee and former vice president Joe Biden. Following are letters to the editor responding to the profiles.  #NewsBriefs
In case you hadn’t heard, last week President Donald Trump attacked his presumptive Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, on religious grounds. “No religion,” declared Trump. “No anything. Hurt the Bible. Hurt God. He’s against God.”It’s
It is too late in the day to express shock at anything that drips from Donald Trump's lips.  #NewsBriefs
Now Joe Biden has selected Kamala Harris as his running mate, we must double down on our efforts to boost Democratic Voter Turnout in November. Because to defeat Trump, every Democrat, Independent, and anti-Trump Republican will need to vote for Biden &amp;Harris. #VoteBidenHarris
I get it. Not exactly a huge fan of Biden. Had my eye on others, including Kamala. Cuz y'all not a fan of the ticket, doesn't mean not voting. CAN'T EVEN be an option. Unless you want 4 more years of...🤡  Teaming up with Harris...mic drop Let's go! #vote
We’re not voting for Joe “you ain’t black” Biden... He’s a true racist with His voting record and racist history to prove it and you still refuse to believe it! When will you guys wake up and Stop covering for him.
As you know, Obama/Biden were behind the passage of UN Resolution 2334–not cool , especially for a lame duck president with 2 weeks left in his term.
The glib in the presentation of ka mala and Biden is the first step to failure
But I’m no dog faced pony soldier either man. On November 30330, 1987 I’m gonna do the thing, come on. Trumps a hack, clearly he doesn’t work for you, neither does the other biden! God bless kamala heiress
It’s the beginning of lie after lie after lie...Trump promotes another birther lie, this time about Kamala Harris
And I knew if Biden became the nominee he would pick Harris as VP it looks like my premonition was correct fortunately but unfortunately kinda depressing this election cycle
Never President Biden  His name is running not Joe.  Others are in charge,  Next President a woman with a plan to bring mrs Obama in   Hillarie’s course of action to manipulate the election
I would say governing isn’t about red or blue.. it’s purple.. no politician is the perfect match and for the system to work it is about compromise (purple). Biden can accomplish what we need accomplished.There is only one scenario worse than a Biden / Harris Presidency. It is the nightmare of Harris, Pelosi, Hillary, and AOC working together!
Are you ready to have your taxes go up by 70 -80% everybody well vote for Biden then!
I like your message and I followed you! Biden Harris 2020!
Trump you and Biden both get on stage and have the audience ask one question at a time and then you both answer the question. I only say this so no one gets the questions ahead of time
If you want to be taxed to death, to pay for healthcare for all including illegals vote for Biden / Harris! That is just the beginning.
Professor predicts 2020 election winner - CBS News
I can’t believe people are still battling over Bernie and Biden. The truth is a third-party or write in vote helps Trump. If Biden wins progressives live to fight another day if Trump wins you’re living in La La Land if you think you will ever have another opportunity to vote.
Joe Biden wants to implement sharia law at all nascar events. Still not scared? This means not hot dog 🤬
Fucking hell, Biden sucks ass. I kind of keep myself from paying too much attention to the news mainly because it usually makes me sad. But even in these small doses the amount of pessimism I feel is immense. Why the fuck did Bernie have to throw in the towel early. -_-
JC, Biden sounds like Otis from the Andy Griffith show staggering into one of the cells to sleep it off.

She's REALLY good at this government stuff.  I hope she has a REALLY big role in the Biden admin.
Trouble with that is ... Biden has to be actually coherent in order to be "extreme". Biden rarely even knows where the Hell he is, much less be able to think on any kind of "extreme" scale.   This election is about Trump verses the Deep State push for a One World Order.

why haven't we talked at all about biden winning stepping down, harris being president and Pelosi being vice president... we've all talked about biden saying he's a transition president.. but we've not talked about what that means..
Hey Laura:  Obama knows Biden best.  He has watched Biden deteriorate which is why he told Biden not to run. Now the hope is just get him elected so he can step aside.  That is the plan.  MJ
Hey Hill:  This guilty FBI Deep State Swamp Lizard is the tip of the Obama iceberg. This spying corruption leads all the way to Obama Biden.  Comey, McCabe, Clapper, Brennan, Rice, lots of others should be in jail for their treasonous crimes to bring down Trump. Disgraceful!  MJ
Police Unions endorse Trump. Biden is for lawless and disorder.
Kamala Harris is already bringing energy, dollars and more to Joe Biden's presidential campaign.
u really think joe biden is capable of fixing enough problems to keep the increasingly agitated middle class complacent? i dont
Can’t believe that you’re asking such a ridiculous question. If somebody needs to encourage you to vote for Biden then you’re probably still leaning towards Trump.
if trump gets re elected, all the libs will think the problems in this country are because of him. if biden wins, and none of the huge issues we face gets fixed, they will see that the problem lies deeper in the roots.
A major union representing U.S. postal workers has endorsed Joe Biden for president.

Sounds like something Biden would say too
That’s an extremely bad faith reading of this writing.  Biden’s grades and his IQ comments expose how he understands himself and how DC people understand Biden (or don’t).  It’s an extremely relevant background to the Obama-Biden relationship. It is not an attack on Biden.
💙❤️Nevada born &amp; raised(proud American)&amp;family lived in Nevada for (41) forty-one years.💙❤️Vote for BIDEN/HARRIS whether you’re a Democrat or Republican. As a TRUE Nevadan,please vote for Biden(A genuinely good person&amp;very well-educated).Spread kidness!
Hey James:  WOW.  Beijing Joe was right years ago when he described the predators on our streets murdering people everyday.  He called it right then.  Now Biden refuses to say we need to crack down on these killers.  So we see the murders in many big cities.  MJ
I see only a few low level staffers getting indictments. 2-tiered CJ system and the big ones like, Comey, Clapper, Rice, Biden, Brennan, will only get the title - “UN-indicted co-conspirators”. This will be a wash for the American citizens.
Cynical move for alt-left and alt-right votes. It’s also another tell that his divide and conquer plans are failing because Bernie and most of his crew are backing Biden pretty forcefully. And there is no real third party challenge yet outside the Kanye fraud.
Hey Beijing Biden: Respect strong, smart women.   Have worked with many.  Kamela Harris showed us during various hearings that she is not likeable and a real Bitch.  She called you a racist and a sexual predator during debates. KH did not resonate with Socialist voters. MJ
I would eat cat poop before I voted for Biden👍
Joe Biden did all those things though....
Biden’s friend!
So Joe Biden is Super Liberal #coronavirus now? Your tweet is SO backwards
Just remember, you are not just a representative of Calif, you are representing women of color around the US. Black, Latino, Asian,  and Native American women are looking to you with hope. Praying that you and Joe Biden prove that we are making the right choice!
Biden will accept the nomination then step down, allowing the Dems to select a new candidate. He has to get the nomination first.
But Russia is involved.  Ypu can't fraud a mail in vote, but you can hack a electronic vote machine if you know what to do. That's my thoughts about it and I'm sticking to it. I'm voting for Biden/Harris by mail-in.
Lowbrow —— ( not quite humor, not quite satire, not informative, less interesting. How many rape cases have been filed against T——? How many settlements have been made to rape claimants on and off the record, how many shots of Biden with Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell? I’ll wait...
Fucken criminal.  I'm voting by mail just to spite and to  defy him "just because"  I refuse to stand in a Republican virus so reading line . Puke ass punk Trumpy.  What the Fuck is wrong with him.  I've had enough of his bullshit by his shithole administration.  I'm voting Biden
If you view this and you come away with the notion "I want to vote for Biden" then you get everything you deserve if he becomes president
There's going to come a time with the media where they're going to get so pissed off, even the left-wing media, with them not answering questions that they'll have to start attacking Kamala Harris and her puppet Joe Biden!
Of course no questions for Biden and Harris because it's a scripted event and they don't want to show what a blathering idiot Joe Biden is too soon! As if people don't already know already!
This totally makes sense for Nancy Pelosi's little slip of the tongue a while ago about being second in line for the presidency! Leftist liberal Democrats might want to rethink their choice of Joe Biden in November!
That's the thing about these idiots today voting for Biden and Harris! They could care less about those two and what they stand for and what they don't stand for! They just don't like Trump and that is not a qualification to vote anyone into the highest office in the land!!
Kamala Harris doesn't know what nationality or ethnicity Kamala Harris is,, she'll be whatever you want her to be as long as it gets her to be the president! She has no interest in the vice presidency she's just biding her time to deem Biden unfit if he wins!
I don’t care for trump but anybody “settling” for Biden is just showing the Democrats that they’re able to have anybody as a candidate which is the lowest standard, if you plan on being better than the Republican Party at least vote somebody in who is actually better
#PresidentTrump did this... Biden didn't.

Hey Bishop: Communist US Catholic Conference of Bishops missing in action.  Should come out against Biden Harris because they support unrestricted abortion. Pure evil! Since They Support Open Borders, the Green New Deal and now idiotic defunding Of police, they remain silent.  MJ
no you WONT be getting a Nobel Prize, you cannot compete with President Obama, and you cannot steal his Nobel Prize, you’ll never be a tenth of the man that President Obama is,  oh I’m sure President Biden will receive a Nobel Prize, &amp; Dr Fauci also, but not you
Hey Bishop:Waiting for the US Conference of Bishops to come out against the evil Biden Harris ticket. The Bishops are missing in action because they support Open Borders, the Green New Deal and now idiotic defunding of the police. What about unrestricted abortion infanticide!  MJ
Hey Bishop:  Why aren’t we hearing from the US Conference of Bishops.  Biden, who pretends to be Catholic and Harris support abortion right up until birth and even after.  Pure evil.  Deny Biden Communion.  Faith without action allows evil to prevail.  👿’s work.  MJ
Australia today - USA on Jan 20, 2021 if Harris/Biden elected.
Remember Biden made the statement, he was running for a senate seat. I don’t believe he knows he is running for President. Therefore we now have Kamala .
Can’t wait for the debates between Biden and President Trump!!!!
Biden plagiarizes all the time, he has done it for years. He never has decent thoughts of his own maybe that is a good thing.

I know that in general, more information is "always good." However, this information is meaningless.  If Biden wins, then the list is Biden 99.9%, All Others 0.01%. Why are we even bothering to talk about a presidential election that has no context?
I’m sorry. Maybe I’m not a true progressive thinker but wishing death on people like kamala and joe biden ain’t my cup of tea. That’s disgusting and just not my style.
This is what a Biden / Harris presidency will look like, A DICTATORSHIP FOR ALL. HE'S MAKING DEMANDS ALREADY AND HE'S NOT EVEN PRESIDENT YET!
i am participating in the election TO DISRUPT. i dont want the DEMOCRATS to win,i want the LITERAL FASCIST out of one of the most powerful offices on the planet. unfortunately, that means a vote for biden at the time being. im not planning on letting the dems sit pretty jfc
aaaaaand we are back to the false choice thing you did at the beginning. i am going to vote for biden AND THEN BULLY AND ADVOCATE AND PROTEST FOR THE COMPLETE ABOLITION OF THE POLICE its not that complicated of a position to understand
Well, great! We only get to decide between two men accused of rape! And we have a rapist on the Supreme Court! But I think the world will be made worse with Trump, so I will vote for Biden and hope Harris will replace him...although I prefer Warren.
Lol. I would say the Dems are so desperate they would run a wooden dummy for president and and as it turns out they are, and they know it. Again want their way- hiding  Biden’s mental defects behind a wall of opacity.
If their going to blantly lie why stop at something this meaningless?  Why not say if they win, Kamala and Biden will put all the people who don't support BLM in concentration camps.  Fuck it if your gonna lie go big
IMO, the defining question (and presumptive lesson learned) that this election reprises is, “Will this prove to be a best foot forward?”
did you read my whole tweet or did u literally stop at "marx would advocate voting for biden" its really weird it seems like you only are responding to this tiny piece of my whole argument whats that called again?
marx would advocate for voting biden and continue doing social and leftist work outside of that. he disagreed with political accelerationism, because it doesnt really tend to work. he favored economic accelerationism, things like general strikes. maybe you need to read up

Thank you for your service sir! You were so inspiring and touched my heart. Thank you also for voting for Biden!!
if you really think the material conditions of marginalized groups arent far worse off under trump than biden i dont even know where to start.
Thank you for your service Steve! Also, thanks for being a patriot and voting for Joe Biden
LIAR LIAR ON FIRE! No commie dem tells the TRUTH!  You know that Trump brought the economy back from the disaster that was Obama/Biden admin!  To the best economy in 70 years!  What a joke you are!I’m hearing you aren’t eligible to be a VP!  Imagine that. HEELS UP HARRIS!
you guys keep framing this as a choice, like if i vote i have to stop going to protests and shit. I CAN VOT FOR BIDEN TO SAVE SOME LIVES AAAAAANNNNDDDDD STILL ORGANIZE THATS THE WHOLE POINT
Thank you for your service and thank you for voting for Biden!
You are my only viewer. Also, who did Joe Biden rape? Feel free to talk about his crime.
these "Never Biden" people wouldnt piss me off so much if they werent so bad faith all the time. anyone participating in society in any way is a fucking liberal to these people.   "oh you pay taxes? LIB!!"
Trump calls out Biden for 'politicizing the pandemic': 'Appalling lack of respect for American people'
like i dont disagree with anything you said. its still better for the literal survival rate of trans/lgbt BIPOC with biden in office
do you really believe that the material conditions for marginalized people will be identical under either biden or trump?
and i advocate for both. but it is much easier for us to do real work under a milktoast liberal instead of an actual FASCIST. voting for biden is a utilitarian act to stop some bleeding in marginalized communities. i dont have any delusion of it being a radical move

any actual leftists voting for biden are keenly aware he isnt progressive at all. the endless strawmanning is getting exhaustinggggg
Biden and Kamala represent the Dem. party very well.
Biden/Harris like our lives depend on it, because they do.

I couldn’t agree more!!  I don’t have time to listen to a bunch of negative crap about Biden and Harris. Anyone I see that says they better do this, I’m sitting this one out or they’re voting third-party I will immediately block. I’m done with the negativity.
In fact, I'd argue that Biden's plan should go a step further and abolish all homeowner's associations, because seriously, fuck those things.
Five thirty eight has given Biden the same exact odds of winning that they gave Hillary. Down to the exact number. And they’re supposed to get these things right?

I mean, both can be true. Biden and Harris are running as very liberal candidates, but Trump is far more extreme than they are.

Because it rhymes with Biden.
Biden does NOT has a misconduct case 😡 against him
No, I just exaggerate. But there is pushback on Biden from Arab-Americans because they want him to take a stand for Palestine. Which he obviously cannot do and expect to become president, of this country at least.
Biden/Harris: a ticket every real American can vote for: good-bye fascism  #Biden #Harris #2020Election #Democracy #Trump #Fascism
I don’t know how DEM supporters can pretend to be excited about the Biden Harris ticket. Neither stand out as leaders, or visionaries. They have no ideas of their own. They will take their orders from the unseen powers.
Neither Biden or Harris will lead. They will take orders from their overlords.
Hey Beijing Biden:  Trump is cleaning up the messes you left behind.  Lousy Trade Deal.  Energy Independence.  ISIS and Terrorists.  Afghanistan.  NATO.  Russia, China, Iran, North Korea.  Growing our economy.  You would take us backwards.  No thanks.  MJ
Isn’t this how Biden selected his list of VP candidates? 😂 Georgia clothing store called 'racist' for appointment fee policy | Fox News
Maybe he really wants to see Biden/Harris in the WH? 🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
I have a crazy theory, the other democrats were beating her up worse than expected, so biden told her to drop out, now that he's made her the VP nominee he'll drop out she'll pick coumo as VP
won't endorse Biden until he says we gotta push Israel into the sea
I have no talent for drawing comics but I’m realizing how much potential fame and fortune awaits anyone who can can weave the needle of “Ben Garrison, but for Biden”
Biden is the president for the working man, as is shown here.   Terrible Ad!
If AniFa were white supremacists - which they are not, they’re Biden voters - you would be right.
Trump should demand to see Biden’s medical records .. 👍
This election is t about Joe Biden &amp; Trump. It’s Nationalism vs Globalism Socialism
This will come back and bite her and Joe Biden because they're counting on that millennial vote! Well this just destroyed it lol!
“Stip criticizing our very easily criticizable candidates for the highest title in the world, ya know the one with the power to deploy about 3 million troops worldwide? The one that’s funding concentration camps along our border? The shit that Biden won’t stop! Ohkaithxbai”
Only thing they were missing was one stuttering fool who can't compose two coherent sentences but wait a minute Joe Biden was there lol!
I agree I just don't want to waste my time with DHD, People's Party because its going to take them a while to think logically about this.  I rather focus on the people who are unhappy about voting Biden but will vote for him and grow from there.
We're on the same page as far as persuasion.  I want to influence Democratic voters and I think the way to do it is by being part of their circle not outside as DHD, People's Party. That means supporting Biden/Harris for now and pitching in Yang immediately after the election.
That's exactly my point. The people who are voting for Biden/Harris have a close relationship with the Democratic party and each other. It's its own bubble. And it's easier to influence if we're inside that circle.  We won't be able to do it as outsiders.
Biden/Harris...somehow, I feel like I’ll finally be able to get a full nights sleep after they take out the trash on January 20th. 😉
This is the kind of control we do not want a BIDEN/HARRIS TICKET WILL RESULT IN ALL OF OUR FREEDOMS BEING TAKEN AWAY! THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING.
This poll is gross. How could anyone vote Biden/Kamala? They must be blind and deaf!
Watching news media publish Biden/Trump poll numbers is honestly laughable but also annoying. I don’t have a short memory and 2016 is too fresh. I don’t see much trust in these polls.
I live In a rural area.  I'm voting for Biden.  Call me a cowboy, call me whatever.. it's that Wild West thing that drives me for Biden and Harris.   Not Trumpy's Regime of violence.   I'm on a self serving lockdown at our homestead from the Republican virus.  I'll live to vote.
Thank god for Biden. I feel so warm and comfortable again. It's amazing. I see the promise land coming. .  I don't see Mexico paying for a wall, or health care in his first 100 days or a "rock head" on Mt Rushmore
I'll take Biden/Harris over the fascist GOP any day!
Kamala Harris could get up there and stutter and spew gibberish just like Joe Biden and they would say it is all gold! This media has no shame!
Just saw ad saying Biden/Harris will lead us out of the covid-19 pandemic. I wonder how they can do that!!! Are they going to breathe in all the germs so that the rest of us no longer have to worry????
I give it 10 years and Iraq will be carved up like a Thanksgiving turkey, unless Biden gets elected and decides to restart us interventionism.
HEY!! Everyone settle down. Joe Biden just called her CARMELLA. 😎🇺🇸
Joe Biden just pronounced it CARMELA. What? No reply?
I'm now over 60% convinced Biden will not be the nominee, Cuomo the executioner will end up being kamel toes VP
You're exactly right and we're not only fucked because of Biden possibly winning but the fact that Kamala Harris will take over as president shortly thereafter!
I hope America wakes up before November because if not Biden and Harris will destroy this country!
CNN and MSNBC will cover Biden and Harris up until the point to where questions need to be answered then they'll cut away to something else!
I have noticed that both Biden and Harris now will not take any questions at all or if they do take some they'll all be softball questions?? They will continue to hide from the media until November if they're allowed to!
That's exactly right, Kamala Harris will do and say anything to become president even having to denigrate herself and work under Joe Biden until she deems him unfit and is president herself!
Rest assured Kamala Harris is in this to be President she could give a shit less about being vice president she will be there to deem Joe Biden unfit less than a year in office!
Nothing; and I mean nothing scares me more than Biden and Harris winning the election.
Biden’s not a rapist, Harris isn’t transphobic; vote for the one who will do less harm to the marginalized.
You don’t care because it doesn’t fit your narrative. Obama was eager for Hillary and more than reluctant for Biden.
it’s depressing you let the perfect become the enemy of the good. Don’t back the orange turd, remember all the appointments Biden would make #SaveThePostOffice
Everyone will sleep better tonight knowing that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have got this. #BidenHarris2020
Great speech by ⁦⁦ ⁦ video of ⁦ presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee, formally introduced Sen Harris
Both parties are far right and serve corporate donors. They’re literally the same party. As far as the candidates go this time around, they’re both senile warmongering racist rapists so there’s not a lot of difference there either. Biden just rapes less.
And I just cried off my night cream.  Thank you for making the calls and sharing it with us. Heart wrenching and inspiring. Joining my Biden Harris phone banking training tomorrow afternoon!
doing this cool thing where i don't listen to or watch Biden/Harris say literally anything just so i can hopefully stomach voting for them. also..  GUT THE
Can’t wait to see  “wipe the floor with you” debating and YES America’s choice ‘could not be clearer, Biden-Harris 2020! Pence tells 'Hannity' he 'can't wait' to debate Kamala Harris, says voters' choice 'could not be clearer'  #FoxNews
My husband, my grandsons, their friends and I have her back, I’m thankful to be part of their first presidential election as they cast their vote for Biden/Harris2020, it’s so exciting, I’m a proud gramma🙏❤️🇺🇸❤️🙏
You need background. Biden will support and enhance Obamacare. A US version of UK’s NHS? Great idea, but will never survive a Republican filibuster. We’re talking about a country that can’t even agree to wear masks in a pandemic. Trump wants to eliminate Obamacare. Biden doesn’t.
The possible trap I can see is if Biden wins, the left hammers down harder with their ideology and socio-pressures.  If Trump wins, then they hammer down with the riots and violent socio-pressures.
Biden-Harris so excited long live the Democratic Party.Get out and vote this November🥰

No. Really? 'Antifa' website cited in conservative media attack on Biden is linked to — wait for it — Russia
what's great is I predicted all of these replies in  my 2nd tweet.  It buys us time. Biden and Harris buy us time. trump keeps the clock ticking against us.
Notice Joe says, "If," not "when." And KAMALA is "ready to lead on day one." Your vote is for a far left VP who will take over quickly, bc they won't have a minute to lose. Biden's. Own. Words.
I remember Black groups harping on the fact that Kamala locked them up in record fashion...so did Biden for that matter.
I'm sorry but if you think Kamala Harris is a good pick for VP then you're actually a fucking idiot. She called Biden a racist that is guilty of his sexual harassment cases, imprisons a ton of small offenders, lengthed sentences for prison labor and jailed/fined parents.
To all at Fox Lies, your lame ass attacks on Biden &amp; Harris are totally, damn ignorant &amp; just plain moronic! America knows you are paid whores &amp; prostitutes for Ruppie Murdoch!  You will  burn in HELL! 11/3/2020 is Defeat Day for Drumpf!🇺🇸✌️
Joe Biden already destroyed lives of minority groups with mandatory minimums crime bill. What is there to be scared of ?
My hands are waving in the air, #Biden/Harris2020🙏❤️🇺🇸❤️🙏
Seriously? Trump is 30-50 minutes late to every presser he's ever held, the media hasn't complained once. Biden is delayed once due to a power outage and suddenly the knives come out.

Question:  If Warren had been a POC, do you think Biden would have picked her?
You're very confused as usual Mr. Biden, HE SAID I QUOTE THERE ARE GOOD PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ISSUE, THE ISSUE BEING WHETHER TO TAKE DOWN THE STATUE OR NOT IN QUESTION.
With Joe Biden's very toxic VP pick  can't really support the Biden/GoldDigger ticket with a straight face. The two will make for "The Greatest Show on Earth" until #November3rd when it all ends. Glad to see Trump will get 4 more years now. #DemsElectionFraud
Trump holds press conference after Biden, Harris deliver remarks  via
It’s a lousy ticket. But Democrats will vote for Biden. Republicans will vote for Trump. And the election will be decided in the “battleground states” by Independent voters who will vote against the candidate they hate more. Presidential elections are that simple.
for you saying you didn’t watch Biden &amp; Harris speech, you sure comment on every single subject, on everything thing said, you are sure a pathetic loser, I can’t wait for the day you’re escorted (in handcuffs) off the people’s property, Americans property🙏🇺🇸🙏
Looking forward to her Biden administration replacement, who will be capable and ethical.
Harris is a phoney. Biden just lost his bid for president by hand-picking a gold digger whose been handed everything including every job she ever held. Her prosecutorial record of putting away innocent black men in California ended her nomination. Buh bye.

Biden and Harris will look great in the room!!!
Trump draws ridicule for press conference after Biden/Harris event: ‘Did someone give him a Valium?’
Breaking News:   endorses Biden/Harris.
Joe Biden could shoot me in the middle of 5th Avenue &amp; I would apologize to him for using up one of his bullets and then I would crawl on my hands &amp; knees thru infected COVID grass to the polling place to vote for him on Nov. 3
(2)I've said it before: Biden and the DNC are holding us hostage. trump is the gun. But if you give me the choice, I'll choose the hostage taker over the gun any day, because with the hostage taker, I at least have a chance at survival.  The gun has to fucking go.
You're preaching to the choir. I have a lot of trouble voting for Joe Biden. He's awful. AWFUL. He's responsible for some of the worst legislation in US history.  I 100% maintain he is 𝘭𝘦𝘴𝘴 𝘣𝘢𝘥 than trump, however, and that with Biden, we'll at least have a chance to live.
Trump doubles down after being confronted with his claim Biden wants an ‘invasion’ of suburbs
well its ridiculous because its a mischaracterization of my position. im not voting for biden to shake up the system. im voting for biden to save lives while we shake up the system. a vote will 0bviously never change systemic issues. its a utilitarian action to reduce harm
well you are right about 1 thing, next year WILL be better because YOU WONT BE IN OFFICE, President Biden &amp; Vice President Harris will make it better, they put themselves aside &amp; work for the American people
Donald Trump is a liar liar liar, you’re evil, you are DONE, hey Diaper Don, you’re a LOSER! bye bye Donny Done! Stop you’re lying, EVERYONE knows you’re lying, so many, SO MANY Republicans are swearing to vote for Biden, so many say “I’m an ex-republican because of trump”
I see you’re as handsy as Biden.

Biggest corrupt candidate team this side of Obama Biden. Democrats have been taken over by Marxist progressive thugs. #Trump2020Landslide
She checked all of Biden's boxes. Unfortunately.
this take is dumb and i dont have enough characters in a tweet to debunk it but basically, not a single lefty on earth is voting for biden and expecting systemic change from it. lefties are voting biden to save marginalized lives. organizing happens outside electoral politics.
Joe Biden/Kamala Harris is a conservative ticket. Paleo Republican if you will...
Who is trump?  After listening to Biden and Harris today I feel hope again. Why listen to donny downer?
Biden and Harris going after Trump is exactly what they need to do, bully the bully, its the thing Hilary didnt do enough of, go after him and make him lose his shit and prove how incapable his is to lead
OUTSTANDING🙏❤️🇺🇸❤️🙏ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING! Biden/Harris2020 give me hope for our country, hope for the world, I know our allies watched and they too now have hope, &amp; our enemies &amp; djt &amp; co are running scared now, praise God, #Biden/Harris2020
Biden and Harris enter the stage with this:  Curtis Mayfield - Move On Up  via
Joe: Biden: Kamala Harris' story is "America's story."  It is AN American story, a little words' meaning being critically important to understanding America, it rules and exceptions to its rules.
I love that  and  are going old school with Harris attacking the orange cur in the  That leaves Biden free to talk big picture, unity, vision stuff. It also sets up Harris for a future presidential run from day 1.  This team is smart and exciting
Kamala Harris has been critical of Biden and he still chose her as VP which shows he doesnt mind being challenged and wants to have a different point of view.  Trump has surrounded himself with yes men and fired anyone and fires everyone who dare disagreed with him.
Hey FN:  We listened to Beijing Biden and Phony Kamela Today spewing nothing but lies.   These two Socialists would turn America into Venezuela.  Poverty, misery and the murder we are seeing on our streets.  Riots, looting and arson all over our country.  This is the choice.  MJ
Everybody knows Biden is unfit to be president. If he won,(LOL), within 2 months,  he would step down and Harris would become president! Think about that, folks!!!!
U.S. Army General Barry McCaffrey agrees with that assessment: “The Biden-Harris ticket is a powerful return to leadership competence and integrity and the rule of law. Sen Harris very experienced. Tough. Extremely intelligent. Also fully qualified to serve as President.
I can’t wait for Biden to sniff her hair
I think it is great news for the Trump campaign. Also I am not sure the Biden camp listened to Harris say that Uncle Touchy is a pedo and a racist.
CNN seems to think Biden will step aside for Harris shortly.

Correct. Now, do Biden quotes from 28 years ago.
It’s all good I get it. And yeah specifically on war corporate dems like Biden would likely be as bad or worse.
It seems that you’re correct. I had in mind if they chose a white woman like whitmer. Harris is a great choice and it has generated a lot of excitement. I was originally for her for president though I think that Biden could have chosen her for DOJ once again if white were chosen.
Yes, my point is just don’t downplay trump’s horrible foreign policy to make Biden seem worse. Trump tried to start a war with Iran, praises dictators, sent more troops to the Middle East before pulling some out to get it back around the number when he took office, etc
I more worried about younger people’s obsession with the kardasians. That will get him votes for sure. But I will not vote for Kanye, biden, or trump. They are all horrible people.
I still don't understand how someone can think Biden and Kamala ARENT centrist-right leaning.... But then I remember...
I agree with Laura on the international reputation point. That being said I think a Biden presidency would be equally as bad for foreign policy. They’re both senile warmongerers. I don’t trust either to not embarrass the US on the global stage, or to start/perpetuate war.
Biden has no chance to win.
Biden did not pick her she was picked for him it was planned and biden can not debatentrump he will lose .  And kamala is not african american she has a jamanican dad and indian mom
President Biden ain't into gold kitsch.
A Biden win will Kill the Market . Huge sell-off .I cant believe those that have enjoyed the the Great Trump economy and improved trade deals would B dumb enough to vote for this new Radical left agenda😱
I think we are close. Don't know if it will happen, but there are people that are trying to force a lot of things they shouldn't be.  It's almost feels like a trap whether Trump or Biden wins.
Biden, not my first choice. Harris, again, not my first choice. But they have experience, can put 3 words together and make a comprehensible sentence. They can also put together a team, which makes them a whole lot better than orange and wall paper paste.
That is the start of Season 46, followed by the "who's Biden this season" contest between Sudeikis and Woody Harrelson

BBC News - Why Kamala Harris is a historic VP pick for Joe Biden
Biden doesn't lie. If he misspeaks he immediately corrects himself.  Biden would take down an incorrect remark, before Twitter cld, &amp; immediately apologize. But mostly, Biden wld have done his research, conferred with the scientists &amp; make official announcements, not a  tweet

It’s remarkable that he is so unaware of his own propensity to project that he projected his personal value system onto Biden’s choice process without question and then justified it with hyper-local demographic specific wishful thinking.
Why would you vote for Biden?
"Percieved in Frisco"? Among WHO? Pelosis' followers? Maybe it's street scum, numbered in the hundreds, who don't know how to vote, much less how to change their drawers.  The "Biden/Harris Ticket" ain't nothing!  Ballot harvesting and fake mail-in ballots is the REAL problem.
Biden's not the only one with early dementia.
If Biden wants to lose, sure
I agree with you about Biden, Klobuchar, and Harris.
You are clearly unfamiliar with Biden/Harris ticket's deep ties to the prison industrial complex
No more bailouts for these criminals this is absurd anyone with common sense should understand, except for these extreme leftist communists. I want reality back! Look at what has occurred in the last 6 months can you imagine what would happen if Biden wins!!!
No. I am, however, disgusted that he chose a California cop with a shameful record of exploiting young black males to feed the disgusting &amp; bloated  prison industrial complex in California. Biden is responsible for entry of the same nationwide. What a terrible ticket
What bothers me about Biden is not exactly his sponsorship of the 1994 crime bill--I think the social conditions and realpolitik of 1994 complicate some of the after-the-fact criticisms--but how he reveled in its most brutal implications, like new death penalty cases.
Now there's a black woman involved, yeah, I think you can pretty much bank on trump's attention being less focused on Biden.

Republicans File Emergency Request With Supreme Court Over Vote-By-Mail Ruling
A short time after Joe Biden's announcement yesterday, Pres. Trump was asked about Senator Kamala Harris as a vice presidential pick. He said, "...we’ll see how she works out. She did very, very poorly in the primaries..." and that he was "a little surprised that he picked her."
But she wants those people to vote in her favor.  Voting for Biden would be one of those "really bad decisions"
If Biden is really losing his mental sharpness I call he steps down somewhere between Year one and two, Kamala takes over and gets re-elected for a 2nd term.
Surely, now that Harris and Biden are together on one super strog, magnificent, golden ticket to heaven, their supporters will reach out an olive branch of peace to Sanders' suppprters, seeking our allyship and cooperation because they care deeply about policy and party unity.
Trump would never hire a woman who had been critical of him. Therefore he assumed Biden would not choose Harris. Wrong again!  He sees everything through the prism of his own narcissism.
T*ump, Biden, and Harris agree on I*rael. If you bring up the embassy relocation under t*ump, you're oversimplifying the situation. I do not have a fuck to give anymore. I am once again outside of the political realm and my ppl's humanity removed from public discourse.
Now that the Veep pick is in and is (unsurprisingly) also a Zionist, telling me to vote for Biden is literally telling me to choose your comfort over mine. For those of us whose lives are heavily affected by decisions around Palestine, the threat of worse does not exist.
Hey James:  If Biden wins, the day after Fake News and Other Socialists will begin pointing out his dementia.  Choosing a half Black woman will insure his demise.  They will not wait 4 years to get rid of him,  voting for Biden is really voting for Harris.  MJ
The Trump campaigns paid surrogates posing as  caricature of the “radical left” are not doing #SleepDon any favors portraying  as a cop. The memes Trump and his illegal  Russian ad agency trolls are flooding the info space with boosts Biden/Harris LE cred.
Do you think she was choosen based on her level of corruption &amp; willingness to be (potentially) compromised? It’s obvious to me. Kamala Harris is the obvious choice. I’m a former democrat, that’s just my option. I left the party when Bernie conceded to Biden. All I see is decept.
Hey Bill:  Biden’s VP choice is a critical issue given his dementia. If he wins, Kamela Harris will be President in the first year.  They will use the 25th Amendment to push him out, or he will just Resign.  So those voting Biden are really voting Harris.  Scary.  MJ
We're you shooting up.dope during the debates? Warren and Sanders absolutely mulverized Biden multiple times
Watch out people!!  Biden and kamala  are on a : " TRUMP ATTACK! ".  Fully loaded with A big gun;  The American Constitution!🇺🇸  Trump better go hide in his bunker!  And build a higher-useless wall around our White House!  You need to understand Trump: Our constitution lives on!
Agree, I’ve been referring to them as President Biden and Vice President Harris for months, looking forward to the next 4yrs, then for the following 8yrs of Madam President Harris, Amen, Amen, Amen🙏
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT: Yesterday afternoon, Joe Biden announced that his running mate in this year’s presidential election will be California Senator Kamala Harris. What do you think of the choice?
Text Biden if you want a hood ..
Biden picks a literal slave driver that doesn't care about black lives. The Dems have given a huge🖕to the progressives. Calls for defunding the police met with an AG a terrible history of keeping POC in prison for cheap labor...
I can't imagine listening to them together  or separately giving any kind of campaign speech! Especially compared to Trump, no passion, no message that appeals to real Americans, in 15 minutes it'll all fizzle out and then BIDEN will ask "Where am I"?
Suffering from the same long term illness that owns Romney.. Sore Loser TDS. A vote for Biden is a hard vote for socialism communism
Mr. President, the democrats will have Harris bully you because Biden doesn’t have it all together. Please ignore her, just keep after Biden. No matter what she states, just keep your statements and tweets on Biden.
Joe Biden has no problem with a woman by his side. trump is petty and vindictive. Joe is man enough to listen to the POV of women. trump is too insecure and sexist to see a woman as his equal.  And then there's Pence...1st of all he wld have to ask for mother's permission.
Does Joe Biden know who Joe Biden picked for VP running mate?
Why did team Biden choose to exclude diversity from the stage? Especially following your endorsement. Lame
Biden will win only with extreme VOTER FRAUD IN PLACE..
Example ballot:  Progressive - 1 Biden - 0 Trump - 0  Please explain how this equals a vote for Trump. I'll spare your brain the agony: it doesn't
Everyone you must vote this is a very critical time good vs evil,  whatever you think of Trump, if you vote for Biden you will be reimagining your world literally!
They will both share different basements however she will be a little bit more out in the public as she's not a gibbering idiot like Joe Biden is
Joe Biden doesn't even know what he had for breakfast let alone who he actually picked to be his vice presidential nominee. Someone did it for him and he's just playing along!
Kamala Harris is neither a moderate nor is she pragmatic,, she is a fake politician that will say anything and do anything to obtain power! She will deem Biden as unfit if he wins the presidency and she's looking to be president make no mistake!
If these questions do not get answered in the next two to three months rest assured they will never get answered if Biden and Harris win!
I know right! Everyone knows a couple of months into the Biden presidency, if he does win, she will deem him unfit and she will be the president!
Of course he and all the other liberal Democrats know that Joe Biden will say a bunch of batshit crazy things in a debate with Donald Trump so this is one of their arguments to stop that!
The DNC Monster needs to be abolished. They're only good at picking the worst possible candidates POTUS anymore. You should totally be speaking after going to the mat for Biden. Sad
Make no mistake, Kamala Harris believes she is going to be President of the United States not Vice President! I guarantee you one thing, 6 months to a year into Biden's presidency and she will deem him unfit!
I'm Riden with Biden Harris Ticket, you need to stop spreading Conspiracy Theories, you are the Problem.
The ones she locked up for pot or the innocent ones she sent away by denying exculpatory evidence? She is a favorite of the prison industrial complex!  With Harris pick, Biden reaches out to young Black Americans

Kids in school already in Florida and elderly homes have gone up 130% in cases of virus in the last 4 weeks. Are they better off in low income? No Vote Biden/Harris for a better future. Wear a mask. It only will continue if you dont. We are watching this extremely close in NV
Eh it’s honestly more like -98% Biden, -100% Trump. They are both extremely opposed to my values and beliefs, with the negatives greatly outweighing the positives. The truth is, I wouldn’t be able to sleep at night if I voted for either of them.
Hey Smarter:  96% of Republicans are for Trump.  50% of Catholics.  90% of Evangelicals.  Predict Trump EC victory between 353 - 362.  Socialists. Biden - Harris will Be rejected.  MJ
Hey David:  Biden - Harris are nowhere near the middle.  They are evil Socialists so far left that they would turn our country into Venezuela.  Read the Socialist manifesto Biden had adopted.  They are Bernie/AOC.  MJ
Hey Matt:  No real Conservstive could possibly vote for evil Socialists Biden - Harris.  They support everything Conservatives oppose.  They would destroy our country!  MJ
They only picked her because they know Biden is not able and legally she is not able to be president if Biden has to step down, which means Pelosi is next in line. God help us. #Trump2020
There was never any bait. Biden was just the placeholder.
Biden picks Kamala Harris or Virgin Mary Republicans would find a million flaws.
They don’t even pretend that Biden abdicating to a female running mate wasn’t the plan from the start. They know that no one on the left will care anyway.
I love how the Biden supporter talks about abuse. Takes one...
Biden could pick Virgin Mary as a running mate and Republicans would find her not so full of grace.
Imagine thinking the country would somehow survive a Biden presidency. Like yes, the senile warmongering racist rapist who wants people to die due to lack of medical care and wants to lock up black people totally won’t also cause a revolution. This country is doomed either way.
Biden’s strength is tha he knows how the Executive branch of 🇺🇸 works, he know what being head of a state and commander in chief is about. He knows what can lead to mistakes or disasters. And most importantly, he isn’t looking to glorify himself because there will be a lot to fix
Don’t waste my time. You have a choice you can either vote for Biden or you’re voting for Trump there is no in between. I’m done with you.
Listen. I'm not a fan of Biden and Harris. Not even remotely. But we are once again in a position of choosing the lesser of two evils where one evil, if re-elected, will actively contribute to the deaths of minorities, LGBTQ+, POC, etc. So you cannot sit this one out.
Agreed. It’s like Illinois: you could win every county except Cook, but if your opponent wins Cook by a lot you’re toast. And I’m sure Biden takes Delaware.
Progressives, most, are learning to tolerate Biden (oops). This one, me, I'm so glad to see someone so fucking smart and articulate running for office. She scares the right people with good reason.
Without mentioning Trump give me three good reasons I should vote FOR Biden and Harris.
Oh lord. Mystery Science Theater meets  presser with Biden and Harris providing satirical commentary and laughing at him? He’d never leave his room again.
You make a stupid statement and then try to follow it up with a hit piece. I have every intention of supporting Biden and Kamala. I really try not to waste my time with Trump supporters.
I feel like Biden saw Maya Rudolph in SNL singing, “you could have had a bad bitch” and told himself he’d never be as stupid as the American people. #theclencher
I love Amy!  Love her. She was my 'want' as President and VP. She will be a positive and fierce advocate for the Biden/Harris ticket. 💙
I don’t know that  would’ve been comfortable in a Biden administration.  She’s cut from a different cloth.
Hey James:  If Biden was Elected, Fake News and the Socialists will do him in within the first 6 months to get the first half Black Woman President.   All of a sudden, Biden’s Dementia will be obvious.  Just wait.  MJ
Hey Alarreid:  Hiden Biden is no Catholic.  Beijing Biden supports abortion right up until birth and even after.  Biden must be denied communion.  Really should Never attend a Catholic mass.  MJ
CONGRATS ON KAMALA HARRIS BEING NAMED BIDEN'S VP. I HOPE BIDEN FINDS A PLACE FOR SEN, ELIZABETH WARREN ON HIS CABINET.
Biden’s would be DORY
I’m voting for Biden/Harris and so excited about it, I can’t stop smiling
Honestly Biden would likely put conservatives on the bench to appease the right anyway. And even if they were dems, they’d align with him politically so they’d be republican light.
No matter which one Biden picked Obama would say it was a perfect choice.  Not touching the nailed it comment at all.
Not to diminish Biden, but I am way more excited about Kamala.
Couldn’t care less there Biden Jr.
I need a crafty person or a campaign team to make me a Biden/Harris rainbow sequin tote bag. I don’t think it’s too much to ask.   Anyway here’s a picture of clouds.
Okay!  In this case, I will yield to identity politics. This tandem gives you a perfect illustration for the true meaning of 'Uncle Tom.'  There is no ‘do no harm’ VP pick
Hey dumbass, third party voters have been polled on this. If they had to vote for Biden or trump, the vast majority would just stay home, with small percentages going to Biden and trump. So no, those third party votes wouldn’t swing the election. We aren’t Trump supporters.
According to exit polls bernie should have won. Unfortunately there was a margin of error in the double digits all favoring Biden... and according to the UN, exit poll discrepancies greater than 4% signal election fraud.
Trump/pence will take us to out in the middle of the desert and leave us with nothing, Biden/Harris will take us out in the middle of the desert and leave us with nothing but thoughts and prayers. It’s the same fucking location. He’s already said nothing will change.
At the height of civil unrest between minorities and cops, Joe Biden chose to run with a cop that intentionally blocked evidence that could free wrongly imprisoned minorities from prison/death row. Have fun on Election Day, folks
Voting for howie Hawkins, who is much closer than Biden or even bernie to my positions. Biden would be slightly better than 4 more years of trump, but he’s still a senile warmongering racist rapist who’s extremely right wing on policy and I can’t vote for that.
To end my rant, I’ll say that Kamala is extremely ambitious and that is extremely awesome.  She will see that a 2024 run is easier when she puts points on the board. Makes Biden look good too.  Ambitious politicians are good. Trump has very little ambition outside of reality TV.
When you think about it, it is kind of incredible that Biden kept a major decision like this under wraps until exactly the right moment, when Trump's office experiences leaks every time he so much yells at an underling.
Pretty sure Biden didn’t sniff , I mean pick K Harris #CopKamala
Oh no!  Not the one-finger peace sign to the Dems' base?  Bernie supporters, progressives trash Biden-Harris ticket: A 'middle finger' to the base  #FoxNews
Joe Biden is actually my seventh cousin and our common ancestor was a Robinette, so this trivia is actually fascinating to me.
Have you ever seen this kind of enthusiasm for any BIDEN?!?!?!?!
Yeah first of all she got about 2% of the Presidential endorsement so now maybe 1%. As with Obama everything  that comes out of her mouth is a lie! People will see right through her and with BIDEN BY HER SIDE HE WILL SEAL THE DEAL!
Hey remember that time on the debate stage one Kamala Harris call Joe Biden a racist and a do-nothing Democrat... yeah I guess they forgot
She will and, hopefully, she will do a lot of talking for the administration. Powerful mind, powerfully articulate. Will scare the shit out of many. Not a Biden fan, nor 100% with KH, but I am glad for the choice.
That Bishop has no reason to publicly discussing Biden’s communion. It’s outside of his jurisdiction. It undermines the authority of Biden’s own Bishop and the pastoral care of his priests. It’s uncharitable, unbecoming, and bad politics to boot. He should confess and repent.
I'll vote for Biden/Harris, but I'm going to focus on flipping the Senate.

Bernie Sanders: My Message To My Supporters Is To Vote Early And Vote For Biden.
I really wish that Biden could’ve at least picked a VP we could FULLY embrace not just symbolically lmao. This ticket is just very disappointing yet still better than trump I hate it here.
That, and he didn’t have a script. Biden literally gets a script, and still messes up.
I look at what Trump has accomplished. I like him.  Unfortunately he is at war with his own people every day how he gets up in the morning and deals with these negative forces is beyond me. To be clear I will be voting for him not Biden!!
I don't get your tweets back to me I think we're on the same side to be honest with you. I plan on voting for Trump absolutely not for Biden does that clear things up for you.

I’m with your mom, I can’t wait to vote for Biden/Harris
I’m lovin it, thank you President Biden and thank you Vice President Harris, God bless your journey, our journey, America’s journey, God bless America🙏❤️🇺🇸❤️🙏
Bishop falsely claims Joe Biden is not a Catholic — and it doesn’t go well for him
Okay but did anybody get the text from Biden about Kamala being his VP (it's of a surprise to literally no one and anyone with sense and have eyes that can see could see that shit coming) or was that a desperate ploy to get the suckers?
Well Donald Dud, Diaper Don, Don the Con’s....&amp; his crooked cronies are already pulling out all the stops to try to vilify Biden/Harris, they can’t win on their own merits so they make up lies about honest people, they spew their venom &amp; their cult drink it up
I love seeing Trump ads that show Biden being anti-cop and he had to double down despite already saying he won't defund the police to hiring a cop as his VP. Gotta keep to your Republican roots.
As much as I think most people have made up their minds, not holding a debate would basically just confirm Biden's mental decline.
Thank you, Senator! Looking forward to helping you and Biden get elected and with the hard work to follow! 🐝💛🍦😎

Trump isn’t liked by most of America, that is a fact.  Biden could have chose a pack of bacon and will still win.
The people that were telling you they wanted a Biden/Harris ticket are probably thinking about those “on the fence” Republicans. They’ll vote for Joe, but would they choose Harris over tRump? I know we shouldn’t worry about that, but if we can get both side of the aisle? Huge
Currently debating ordering a Biden/Harris mask...
Dear  if by cop you mean the Biden-Harris ticket is going to police up the corruption and wreckage of the Trump administration then hell yes. That team is cop all the way. What’s #FakeNews is the idea that a mafioso  has anything to do with law and order.
Biden couldn’t wait to announce that she was his VP🤣 remember you ain’t Black if you ain’t voting for him
Thank you, Joe Biden, for not forgetting the ladies!!!
Me, coming home from getting my haircut, which I thought would be the biggest news of the day: That was surprisingly easy and... TLJ: Biden picked a running mate. Me: *holds breath*  TLJ: Kamala Harris. Me: ohthankallgodseverywhere
Obama and Biden are jokes.  I don't support BLM, because all lives matter. And I highly back law enforcement! Trump supports everyone. As he says, we are all American
I can definitely get behind this.
Her history of tough prosecution for possession is a start. That said, people need to be able to learn and grow. She now wants decriminalization, but so does Biden. It needs to be full on legal, but at a minimum, removed from schedule 1 list. Weed is not herion.
This is the real world, and what has Trump done to inspire those votes? And who do you think Biden should have picked? Who is the knight in shining armor that unites the democratic base and undecided conservatives?
Think you’re confused. Biden was pee you folks in his basement. Trump was hiding from the people in the bunker.
Funny how the Nickelback story broke the same time as Joe Biden's VP pick going public... 🤔
And you're talking about the one small set of non base conservatives like thats the only thing that wins Biden the election when its not. Getting a large portion of the 50 million democrats that didn't vote last time is.
Hillary won her primary but didn't inspire anyone outside her base, I love Bernie as a person but his views are simply too radical to win an election, Biden is liked by more people outside the base then Hilary and Harris brings in a more people
Herr Drumpf, you have been the nastiest, most corrupt, most phony, low morals, non-religious president ever to occupy the WH.  That ends on 11/3/2020!  You, your family and enablers will be defeated by Biden-Harris 2020!🇺🇸✌️
I'm thrilled to welcome Kamala Harris to a historic Democratic ticket. She's already proven herself to be an incredible public servant and leader. And I know she’ll be a strong partner to Joe Biden. Please join me in having her back and getting her elected.- Hilary Clinton.

Right now I think I like the former mayor of SF, Willie Brown, as POTUS. He did a great job for SF when I lived there. He’s a little old but likely a lot sharper mentally than Biden.
So she will be the president if TRUMP 2020 DOESN'T GET ELECTED, CAUSE BIDEN CAN'T EVEN TALK CLEARLY
🗳️she was my choice in the primaries, Biden was a distant 5th
Yep - for Biden the Atlanta mayor or Warren would have been the better pick
Except Hilary didn't play well with a lot of people that Biden and Harris will, and you want to talk about un-inspiring VP picks Tim Kaine is the definition of that. He brought nothing. Biden is already more popular then Hilary and Harris brings in a new section of voters
Stacie is right.  This isn’t one of her jokes.  This is not a normal election. 2014 was a normal election. This is about getting our country back. Don’t like Biden? Vote for him anyway. You can vote Republican in 2024.
Congratulations puppet masters of  DNC and MSM for getting Kamilla Harris on the ticket. For over a over a year that has been the goal. Now when the failing Biden is scrubbed off the ticket everyone who supports Trump can be called both a misogynist and racist.
Obama picked Biden to secure racist votes who wouldn’t have voted for him other wise...
Biden can not win without China's help. Trump 2020
There is no reason to move the campaign. This election is about coronavirus, safety nets, and character.  She will speak about changes in drug policy when they come. If Biden talks about this, he will confuse pot w/CBD + Corn Pop will be in the story bc Biden hasn’t “been woked.”
It could have been Biden with a rabid, zombified parrot and I'd have voted for him.
Joe Biden Picks Kamala Harris as His Running Mate: 'a Fearless Fighter'  Wonderful. America is screwed if these two win.
Y'all it could have been Joe Biden/Pathway Pebble and I still would've voted for Biden.
Oh yeah, I hate Mnuchin, too. So if you don’t want to see him as Sec Treas for another 4 years, voting Biden is your best bet.
She's the worst running mate Biden could pick
The best part about this Tweet is it invents some mythical magnanimous Biden out of whole cloth, after Harris went on Colbert and doubled down on how that “gut punch” was all just rhetorical flair
Congratulations to Trump. Biden chose his favorite VP candidate.
You and Biden are going to LOSE! and then you both can go home crying to your mommies.
Joe Biden selects the first Black woman to be a vice presidential running mate. She is an AMERICAN of Jamaican and Indian descent. This is America. Anything is possible. I’m excited at the momentum that can now build…

Trump, Barr, Russia, the Saudis, Russian affiliated Ukrainian oligarchs, and lord knows who else are going to be drumming up all kinds of dark evil stuff about Biden/Harris. Be ready for any and all of it because it will be ugly. Trump will try to take us into his sewage world.
Biden lost my vote with this choice...a California cop? That should play well nationally. Snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. The DNC is such a sham!
Joe Biden's running mate:
Obama praises selection of Harris as running mate: ‘Biden nailed this decision’Regardless, it is still President Trump. Biden wins the polls and the popular vote and Trump wins the Electoral College, you happy with that?
If he is losing to Biden and the polls are correct, then why are the Dems going nuts trying to establish national mail in ballots, why are they panicking about the ability of the USPS to handle the mail in ballots.  Trump is going to win.
Trump spoke to members of the City of New York Police Benevolent Association, the union representing some 24,000 rank-and-file officers as he steps up his attacks on Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris.
You Do realize Joe Biden is trying to say he and obama deserve most of the credit for this deal?
Let's just remember that because if Biden will win then the idea is probably also appealing to him right along with slashing Social Security.
Ah, our country is collapsing NOW!  Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris will be a refreshing change.
Wonder if the $48M Biden/Harris received in 48 hours was funneled thru BLM?
Basement Biden and Dems are so dead. They just don’t know it yet. No one is voting FOR riots, looting &amp; burning, or low income housing in suburbs. No one.

This pandemic has killed Vegas! Biden will sell out to China
No one is pointing out what the spiced together words it has Biden saying. Did you hear the part about children? It’s sick
I will probably vote for  for ballot access, and because she is the closest to my values. I will also vote against ballot initiatives that spend money, or outlaw a noncrime... But, if Nevada goes for Biden, and he invades Syria, I'll feel guilty 🤷
Mostly state not federal issues but I wouldn't expect Biden to know that. Renters rights already exist in most states. Check out how the federal sexual assault survivors bill of rights was passed. As usual, had very little to do with the president at the time (Trump).
What’s worse is the words spliced together to make Biden say something dirty about children.
Biden and Harris thanks you for all of the donations
322 times in 60 days??? So he was going to his basement 5 times a day...  I have been out my house 4 times since beginning of march....  I probably walk through my house 100 times a day...   I don't get their point   I hear Biden every day: TV, twitter, emails, text, zoom, etc
He’s cut taxes so we get more money on paychecks. He’s built the wall like he said. He’s dropped prices of medical supplies. Created more jobs. Unemployment at an all time low until COVID. Biden has been in politics 40 years and done nothing.
has pissed me off. Biden has a new on YouTube. It's a fvcking joke. My camera is not here. Filed 2 complaints on sellers. Trying to get money back. Nothing working today.
I'm very curious what some, possible Biden voters think about this...        If Biden invades Syria, in 2021, and nothing else changes... You were conned by the greater evil, right?
I mean..   ... Do you actually believe this insanely optimistic estimate?  Trump went 4 years without starting a new immoral war of choice as president... Obama didn't with Biden as Veep. Did Biden ever complain?  I'm pretty sure Biden still gets me 20k Syrians dead+
I'll wait while you find the quote from Biden 'hollering' about closing flights to China.  The racist calling started when he extended the ban to some African countries for no reason (they still have nowhere near as many cases as us) a couple of weeks later, because it was racist

The USPS Workers Union has endorsed Biden. Conflict of interest wouldn’t you say?
Soooo what you’re saying is you’d rather vote AGAINST Trump rather than FOR Biden? And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how a republic dies a slow death. Biden is doing as little as possible and thinks it will be enough to earn the highest office in the world. I don’t think so.
On betonline Biden is -135, Trump is +1.05. They have odds on each state too. FL -1.55 Dem, AZ -145 Dem, etc. Based on state odds, here is how EC map looks. Biden easy winner.
FWIW, betonline has odds:  -135 Biden, +105 Trump. Was -180 Biden last week. Doesn't make sense as they have odds for each state. Biden in -155 FL, -145 AZ, etc. Based on state odds, here is EC map. Biden wins easy.

How do you feel about the postal workers union endorsing Biden? If NYPD is the enforcement arms of the state, then what does the mail in voting arms of the state represent? 🤔.
This should show every American how little respect Biden has for we the people. He thinks if he lies to you your stupid enought to believe him. Pelosi said in hot mic Americans are the stupidest people in the world. Dem are LYING
Except FedEx is aloud to open any package they want meaning they can open voting mail if it went through them and just throw out ones for Biden to skew the votes. USPS is not aloud to open private mail

You have to prove Biden is harm reduction. From historical analysis we can say that’s definitely not a thing to accept as a given.
As usual you are awesome Rose💙💙💙💙
The double standard the media has for Biden and trump is astonishing.  Biden has to be perfect; trump, no.
Biden/Harris is closer to my values then Trump. Not a 100% which nothing ever is. Obama wasn't but definitely more than Romney and McCain could ever be. Revolutions invariable have counter revolutions but 2 parties come together to fight an enemy despised by both. 1/2
Neoliberal actions such as trying to get us to vote for fucking Biden in place of organizing actual direct action is what made you my enemy, dummy.

Biden and Harris raised $48 million in 48 hours after the announcement.
Biden Will Be A ‘Constructive Player’ On #Marijuana Reform, Congressman Predicts #MarijuanaNews  via
Best voter database, Catalist, shows non-whites were 24% of 2016 turnout. So to get Biden up by 11, they had to oversample minorities by 13 pts.  Pollsters rig by undersampling whites, oversampling young, oversampling women, oversampling college grad+, usually a combo.
I want a presidential Debate  Biden  vs Trump so we can just this election #Trump2020Landslide
According to Catalist, which studies have shown is most accurate on voter data, non-whites were 24% of 2016 turnout.  Every pollster showing Biden with a lead is undersampling whites by 7 pts or more.
You can hypothesize all you want but Biden’s actions directly gave the police authority to kill PoC indiscriminately, you don’t get to use utility as a bargaining chip. You have to admit you are using arbitrary ideas to select one equivalent evil over another. It means nothing.
Is that why rapist Biden takes and answers so many questions?
I think everyone appointed by Trump should go to jail when Biden crushes him
I'm being honest - I'm not thrilled with these options, I'm more left than Biden or Harris.  Im literally just asking what makes the most tactical sense? And what will help the most people RIGHT NOW?

Me:   Mail carriers endorsed Biden today. They are the ones who will handle our ballots. I think this election might be rigged.  My leftist bro: Why the fk would you think that!!!???!!!  Me:  Let me come pick up your ballot and turn it in for you.  My leftist bro:
It's as crowded as a Joe Biden rally. 😀
Biden is the candidate because nobody was willing to step away so Pete could finish Bernie, starting with NH which the press somehow made a 3 way race with Amy. I don’t know anything anymore after this fucking primary.
Laughing and crying (figuratively speaking) because there are democrats who are actually going to vote for two failed candidates for the Presidency! This Biden Harris ticket is a gift to the GOP! Don't fuck it up GOP!
Gawd, I hope so! It looks like they're doing more than the democrats in washington. Seems like the dems are out maneuvered by the RUSSIAN REPUBLICAN POLITICIANS and The Party "leader".  I'm with Fightin' Biden and Nasty! Make Democracy and the Rule of Law Great Again!
Are you talking about the same usps that officially endorsed biden? The same usps that biden is telling President Trump is out to destroy? The primary ballots I received, (6 for a house w/2 registered voters) had party affiliation on the envelope. Nope!
Obama, Biden as well.
He probably shouldn't unless his internal polling show it a reasonably close race.  If he does make a play, it will scare the shit out of the Biden campaign, force them to spend money there, and spread Joe and Kamala....ahem...thin.
I’m also not a fan of Biden, but hasn’t tRump done enough damage already? He had his shot, he drove our nation to the ground. He’s done. Why is that so hard to understand?
You still not back on? The last thing I posted, I think, is that Kamala Harris is Biden’s VP. I was neither overly joyous nor distraught in that post either.
Joe Biden: "We are better than this moment than we are in."
Okay so you are voted for racist Joe Biden in good concise. Make that one make sense?
Our kids have been in cages since Biden wrote the crime bill bitch, what have you done to stop that?
Yes. This is what leftists mean when they say “voting Biden is harm reduction” It’s not “vote Biden then stop everything we’re doing” It’s “vote Biden so less people die while we keep pushing, even harder.”
Someone telling you that you are wrong is not cyber bullying Jacqueline
In the NV primary I received 6 ballots with only 2 registered voters in the house. They also had a checkbox on the outside of the envelope for party affiliation. The USPS union has endorsed biden and all the leftists are screeching that potus is trying to destroy the USPS. 🤔
I know y’all don’t like Fox News I can get you a different source 👀 or 👁👄👁
Reuters/Ipsos poll sample is 50% Democrat-leaning, only 37% GOP leaning, to get Biden to +7.  Biden is down bigly, not just a couple of points.
In 2012 I was working out of state and had to prove to NV that I was by sending a pay stub from my employer in UT to get a ballot. What they want to do is send ballots out like those landscaping service flyers you get every day in your mailbox. USPS endorsed biden. It’s a scam.
well ok

THE REAL REASON WHY JOE BIDEN PICKED KAMALA HARRIS FOR HIS RUNNING MATE  via
If Trump can have his acceptance speech in the White House then the DNC should request that Biden should be able to have his in the White House. He is a former Vice President after all. Equal time.
You’re correct, and he has broken the law so many times no one could keep track.  There’s nothing Biden &amp; Harris could do to come close.  I don’t want to hear complaints from magats.  I can play “what about,” too.
I’m serious, I just can’t take black folks voting for Biden serious, when his track record is well known. Voting for him is literally the definition insanity.
Nick Adams  · 2h Mail-in voting is not safe or secure.   Joe Biden will say anything to steal the election from  !
I only criticize her because she's going to make Biden lose.
It is good to know that  mail carriers who endorsed Joe Biden for president will be handling my mail in ballot. I'm sure they will be honest.
So excited for Biden-Harris!
The USPS union endorsed Biden.  Conflict of interest?
A deranged imbecile criminal and traitor is what we have now. Biden and Harris are going to change that.
Biden didn't pick Harris as his VP, he thought he was DTF and likes the smell of her hair. 😉
Democratic controlled cities are turning lawless. Got to vote them out or recall them. Biden/Harris ticket &amp; dowballot are a national tragedy waiting to happen.

There's a much more nihilistic twinkle to Billie's eyes which I think is more demonstrative of a Democratic Party that is running a Biden/Harris ticket.
Go to confession! Voting for Biden is not about being “crazy for him” it’s about love of country! Now, good and sin no more! 😀
is anyone voting independent??? or is it just down to biden and trump 😐

Lol  You are racist against your own skin color if you think you black people are a monolith that thinks just like you.  You take away their agency to think differently than you.  Explains your support for Biden considering his #YouAintBlack stance.
Delegate votes don't amplify division. Why so panicked though? I thought Joe was the most "electable"...anyway...  This is just a formality. Biden has more delegates. You can relax now.
if you think biden or Kamala are communist then I feel so deeply sorry for you
Im not.  Im trying to burn the system down.  Including Biden, Kamala and the rest of the GOP enablers.  We fucking warned you.  Bad #sheeple.  No brunch.
I better get my Biden Harris sticker this time 😒
I believe the specific words he said was "In certain cases" which is way different than the blanket bill Biden wrote.
Yes he did.  At that time, he explained his vote (women domestic abuse provisions, if I remember), trashed the part resulting in mass incarceration, and SPENT HIS LIFE TRYING TO FIX.  Biden/Harris still embrace that bill to this day.
Hell, they're already calling Joe Biden a commie, and he's about as conservative as the Dems come  What makes anyone think the black lady cop who once endorsed M4A is going to attract people who think Joe Biden was pals with Joe Stalin
Biden &amp; Harris, I don't care how you do it, but get on the air after everytime Trump uses the White House podium as a rally point and fact check him because some of our media refuses to. Playtime is over kids, get out there and do your jobs.

Joe Biden Picks Kamala Harris As Running Mate #BidenHarris2020
Mr President Pervy Joe Biden just tweeted this. People are losing their homes. Millions have already lost their paychecks. Our country is in crisis. The virus isn’t taking a break — Republicans shouldn’t either. The House did their job. President Trump, bring the Senate back.Done
How many followers does Biden have ?
I don’t get political in my tweets but I would prefer  as #POUS over Biden/Harris or Trump/Pence I am not thrilled at all with our choices for November #elections
UNBELIEVABLE!  And it's true. Check it out.
Oh boy.  I love these polls that exclude the Green party.  Our goal is to get them to 10%.  Which would make it:  Trump: 45% Biden: 43% Green: 10%  What a shame.  #WeWarnedYou
Biden campaign will host virtual watch parties to engage supporters as Democratic National Convention goes almost entirely virtual
Hate Trump all you want because he isnt political correctness in your eyes but this business man took over White House and get a lot of things done for the Americans. Now look what Biden and Kamalas have done together ??? Name one successful policy they helped Americans
Bottom line.   I will do whatever to vote for Biden/Harris in November.
you guys are all fucking stupid if you think joe biden and kamala are winning this next election lmfaoo
Actually, Biden informed the public of what the medical community has suggested. He’s requesting all Governor’s to listen to the exerts, who’ve stated “A 3 month mask mandate, will save the lives of 40k people” ✌🏻💙🇺🇸
The Biden campaign says thank you.
And Biden will propose giving them more money

We caught them. The Obama Administration (INCLUDING JOE BIDEN) illegally spied on Trump! If you vote for the these corrupt Democrats, you deserve the evil they will force upon you!
Ok - fair point. But that has little to do with the actual election. I know that the Constitution is very clear about Trump's term ending at 12:01pm on Jan 20. Biden said he'd have him dragged out if necessary.
GO VOTE! But, to be honest, even if Biden wins by a convincing margin, Trump is going to whine like the baby he is.

Joe Biden dodges every question and you have been pushing a bogus conspiracy theory since January 2017.  Go fk yourself.
I don't like it. But I'm not going to advocate not voting at all. I don't even see it as voting for Biden/Harris. I see it as vote for taking Senate, letting RBG fucking retire, prosecuting Trump, saving DACA/ACA/LGBT rights, protecting courts, COVID action, removing DeVos/Miller
Yeah...I can definitely see a lot of queer and non-white people not voting this year because of the Biden/Harris ticket and at this point can you blame them? It’s four more years of stagnation either way and we don’t have a lot of the privileges to fall back upon.
You are making the incorrect moral choice as you are predicating your argument on a assumption that Biden is any better than trump which you have failed to provide evidence for.
Because  1) the thread is about not voting Biden and 2) the what about you just used to try to refocus the conversation on trump can absolutely be said about Biden- He’s very into cutting social programs and would do so immediately once in.   Direct action is what fixes it.
I have a hard time with that because Biden won the primaries with many states having record turnout, especially among southern black voters. I wasn't happy about it either, but that's how shit went. So now it's time to let the fascist roll over everybody?
Trump's events in Mankato, Minnesota, and Oshkosh, Wisconsin, are being billed as remarks on Biden's “failures on Jobs and the Economy.”
Biden announced he is going to expand Medicare coverage and drop the eligibility age to 60. Also that he is going to look at forgiving student loan debt to ppl making less than $125k per year. He has made moves more to the left Also, if Biden doesn't win the Supreme Court is lost
Honestly I think all these polls showing Biden’s lead are all skewed. Unless we can seriously bring out the vote in the swing states, I think Trump will surprise everyone again in November
Tellingly, neither will vote for Trump.  At least one will vote for Biden.

And the right to remain silent ! Joe Biden’s right will be revoked at the first debate with Donald Trump. Can’t wait to see what kind of excuse he has to remain in hiding? Smoke him out and he will destroy himself.
Biden takes credit for the deal lol Let’s hear about Obama and the Democratic support for the #MuslimBrotherhood, especially in #Egypt. The whole world still remembers his infamous speech in Cairo. This is a new era and the Ikhwan should and will be designated as a ... 1/2
Campaign Ad: Biden Calls For More Decisive Action Against COVID-19
Biden’s one and ONLY true statement 👇  “The choice we make this November will decide the future of America.”
We’ve been over this before but systemic  racism only exists in people’s head like his. In just the last few weeks calling African Americans not diverse in culture or thought, Biden has a shrinking lead with minorities and his language reminds us why
- "In addition to my #MaskMandate I will also mandate Americans change their underwear once a week" #NannyBiden #Biden #BernieBros #BidenIsARacist  #AnchorBaby
Biden wanted to do the same thing though.
And they think BIDEN knows something? Idiots
The DNC knows Biden wouldn't make it a full year if elected. They know that the liberals wouldn't vote for a black(?) woman to be POTUS. (they wouldn't in the Primary). So stick her in as a placeholder VP and shoot for the vagina/black sympathizer vote. Pray for a win by default.
Biden/Harris 2020!! To be honest, like a lot of others the Biden ticket wasn’t my top choice (miss ya Bernie!) but I am joining my top choices in supporting them and they are definitely my top choice over our other…
Trump called an URGENT press conference from the White House yesterday, during a time of unprecedented unrest, and all he did was lie about Biden.  It hardly made a bleep.  This is now normal.
Mueller did not follow U. S. policy, If you mean Biden, policy was not to extort allies.
Bring on the debates.  Pence v Harris, Trump v Biden All questions will be answered.
Biden… Gathering a nationwide audience of bigoted supporters that  “Ain’t black” 🤦🏻‍♂️
In Kamala Harris, Biden chose the perfect prosecutor to go after ‘predator’ Donald Trump: columnist
Brace yourself for one of the most tumultuous and stressful transitions in America history if Biden defeats Trump
If Biden is leading Trump,  why do Trump signs, flags,  stickers outnumber Joe's  a kabillion to zero?!  Yeh, I'm not buying that Joe is leading anything, especially in regards to the election.  🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲   IFBTS 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
What dose Never President Biden and Heels 👠 up Harris know  About $ finance of business let alone a whole Country  Would love to see that interview!  Just saying!
Imagine Biden wins... then resigns because early onset dementia😐  It’s gone be a REAL bad look on “BLACK PPL” when the country go to shit shit under a “BLACK” female president   Smh 🤦🏾‍♂️  Some ya niggas still don’t see ya playing checkers in this bitch
Great. Love it. But reality is, it's between Biden and a Sociopath who has done his best to get people killed and is currently trying to undermine our elections with the post office funding bullshit.
I’m proven right again. I told you so. I told you black Democrats didn’t vote for Kamala in primary. They don’t like her. Biden blew it. Bad pick. Why would someone who did NOT get black vote in primary bring out black vote in main election? Dems so stupid
Losers gonna lose! Trump can try to stop the momentum and love we have for Biden/Harris all he wants, he underestimates the strength and integrity of real America! We will vote him out.

The Post Office has been bleeding billions long before Trump. Obama and Biden did nothing. Schumer and Pelosi did nothing. #BreakUpThePostOffice
Biden’s consistent and recent language only demonstrates his deep seated polarization of minorities calling them not diverse thinkers or not a very diverse group. “Ain’t black” isn’t exactly Progressive, it’s Regressive.
Don't forget that Biden is practically brain dead!
This one IS political. But more Obama vs. Biden &amp; differing styles. Great read.  "If Biden wins, many Ds &amp; Rs believe that at least relations between the White House &amp; Congress will be better than in any other recent administration, including Obama’s."
Who knows more about running industry?  When you take more tax revenue from the business experts, &amp; give it to the government, you are weakening our industries &amp; crippling the economy.  Joe Biden PROMISED to cripple America!
NY Times blames new Covid outbreak in New Zealand &amp; Australia on “border failures.” But they blame TOURISM. Don’t let tourists in. Here in USA the fact that 300 million migrant losers, many with disease, will race to US border if Biden wins...NY Times sees no problem with that!
Good take by  calling the dem ticket #HarrisBiden over #BidenHarris, but it hurts our observation that “BidenHarrisS” begins and ends with BS. Can’t we do both? :) #DanBongino

Biden - decomposing for the inside out  Harris - won’t qualify to take his place cause she’s not American. Her parents aren’t American either.   Pelosi - 3rd in line. She’ll march fema and the un across the country and sell us to China. Fucking nazi stormtrooper betch.  Fuck no.

Extreme is 165K Americans perished, 16 million out of work, 33% drop in GDP last quarter, racial upheaval and POTUS trying to dismantle the USPS.  Perhaps Biden/Harris should use Trump’s pitch to Blacks in 2016 while campaigning: “America, what the hell do you have to lose?”
. once accused  of being a racist who touched women inappropriately. Now, she’s his vice-presidential running mate.
If Biden does win, I’m interested to see how the GOP evolves.
Heard Hillary might have a job in Biden administration. Hillary and Kamala two of the most phony power seeking, hated women in politics that both got where they are by using men.
Plagiarize, lie and cheat your way to power is the first principle of the Biden-Harris ticket.
Hey,  What is the  doing to address the very real threat of the Post Office delays and shenanigans? WE NEED TO HAVE A STRATEGY!  Of course we are supporting the Biden/Harris ticket!  BUT WHAT'S THE PLAN TO MAKE SURE OUR VOTES COUNT?
Get a clue! If Biden was in charge there would have been millions of people killed. He denigrated Trump’s closing of travel with China/Europe. Biden never would have closed borders or the economy and millions more would have died. Just like Cuomo killed thousand in NY rest homes.

Kamala is a gift for Trumps reelection. Everyone saw the Kamala v.p. pick  coming. The only person surprised was Joe Biden
I just love this imagery from the Biden/Harris campaign. Joe said all along that he wanted a partner rather than an underling and the campaign has really presented Kamala as an equal during the roll out and she has the natural gravitas to pull it off.

But when $hillary decided in those last two weeks not to visit WI, MI, OH, and PA, three if which she’d NEVER stepped foot in during the General campaign, THAT’S what doomed her! People DON’T vote for those who don’t court them!  Biden WON’T make that mistake!
Biden-Harris will wage a war on American Energy. Of course the Utility Bills will Skyrocket.

China attacked us with a bioweapon.  It's appropriate to identify that bioweapon by the country that attacked us.  Asian Americans are diverse and they not responsible for China's crimes.  You probably thought they were monolithic--same way Biden sees blacks.
Conspiracy theory... you mean like the Russiagate conspiracy theory you peddled for four years?  Or the Ukrainegate conspiracy theory you peddled to impeach Trump while Biden conspired with Porochenko to steal $40 billion?  Like that?

CURIOUS:  Do you think Biden having a woman as VP will increase the number of women who will vote democratic?
Ignoring policy, Biden sounds like a normal human being who cares about others while Trump sounds like a psychotic idiot who only cares about himself. So why would anyone vote for him? RACISM. They’re willing to forgive/forget everything else including democracy.
Biden did build jobs like crazy in China 🇨🇳 it is a pandemic with a closed nation u did not want because it was racist to shut borders down remember come down to China 🇨🇳 town genius we just had a million plus jobs added to the economy in a pandemic with a closed border

Why does Nancy Pelosi spit and drool. Why does Joe Biden forget everything and say racist things to black interviewers?
No. Bought and paid for by Soros and the DNC and apparently Joe Biden since his website comes straight from the Antifa site.
1. Biden is more in the center than the State of Kansas.  That's *after* shifting left.  2. Good, we need higher taxes on those earning over $1mil/yr.  3. They're not going to enact universal healthcare, the corporate sponsors of the DNC would never allow it.
Of course they want Biden.  That way the USA can keep getting taken advantage of and never, ever, prosper.
Fact check: Trump promotes another birther lie, this time about Kamala Harris  🤡
I surely hope your polls are more accurate. I honestly NC an not fathom anyone voting FOR Biden. These people are just voting against trump.

She's REALLY good at this government stuff.  I hope she has a REALLY big role in the Biden admin.
Trouble with that is ... Biden has to be actually coherent in order to be "extreme". Biden rarely even knows where the Hell he is, much less be able to think on any kind of "extreme" scale.   This election is about Trump verses the Deep State push for a One World Order.

Kamala Harris is already bringing energy, dollars and more to Joe Biden's presidential campaign.
u really think joe biden is capable of fixing enough problems to keep the increasingly agitated middle class complacent? i dont
Can’t believe that you’re asking such a ridiculous question. If somebody needs to encourage you to vote for Biden then you’re probably still leaning towards Trump.
if trump gets re elected, all the libs will think the problems in this country are because of him. if biden wins, and none of the huge issues we face gets fixed, they will see that the problem lies deeper in the roots.

That’s an extremely bad faith reading of this writing.  Biden’s grades and his IQ comments expose how he understands himself and how DC people understand Biden (or don’t).  It’s an extremely relevant background to the Obama-Biden relationship. It is not an attack on Biden.

Hey James:  WOW.  Beijing Joe was right years ago when he described the predators on our streets murdering people everyday.  He called it right then.  Now Biden refuses to say we need to crack down on these killers.  So we see the murders in many big cities.  MJ
I see only a few low level staffers getting indictments. 2-tiered CJ system and the big ones like, Comey, Clapper, Rice, Biden, Brennan, will only get the title - “UN-indicted co-conspirators”. This will be a wash for the American citizens.
Cynical move for alt-left and alt-right votes. It’s also another tell that his divide and conquer plans are failing because Bernie and most of his crew are backing Biden pretty forcefully. And there is no real third party challenge yet outside the Kanye fraud.
Hey Beijing Biden: Respect strong, smart women.   Have worked with many.  Kamela Harris showed us during various hearings that she is not likeable and a real Bitch.  She called you a racist and a sexual predator during debates. KH did not resonate with Socialist voters. MJ
I would eat cat poop before I voted for Biden👍

So Joe Biden is Super Liberal #coronavirus now? Your tweet is SO backwards
Just remember, you are not just a representative of Calif, you are representing women of color around the US. Black, Latino, Asian,  and Native American women are looking to you with hope. Praying that you and Joe Biden prove that we are making the right choice!
Biden will accept the nomination then step down, allowing the Dems to select a new candidate. He has to get the nomination first.
But Russia is involved.  Ypu can't fraud a mail in vote, but you can hack a electronic vote machine if you know what to do. That's my thoughts about it and I'm sticking to it. I'm voting for Biden/Harris by mail-in.
Lowbrow —— ( not quite humor, not quite satire, not informative, less interesting. How many rape cases have been filed against T——? How many settlements have been made to rape claimants on and off the record, how many shots of Biden with Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell? I’ll wait...
Fucken criminal.  I'm voting by mail just to spite and to  defy him "just because"  I refuse to stand in a Republican virus so reading line . Puke ass punk Trumpy.  What the Fuck is wrong with him.  I've had enough of his bullshit by his shithole administration.  I'm voting Biden
If you view this and you come away with the notion "I want to vote for Biden" then you get everything you deserve if he becomes president
There's going to come a time with the media where they're going to get so pissed off, even the left-wing media, with them not answering questions that they'll have to start attacking Kamala Harris and her puppet Joe Biden!
Of course no questions for Biden and Harris because it's a scripted event and they don't want to show what a blathering idiot Joe Biden is too soon! As if people don't already know already!
This totally makes sense for Nancy Pelosi's little slip of the tongue a while ago about being second in line for the presidency! Leftist liberal Democrats might want to rethink their choice of Joe Biden in November!
That's the thing about these idiots today voting for Biden and Harris! They could care less about those two and what they stand for and what they don't stand for! They just don't like Trump and that is not a qualification to vote anyone into the highest office in the land!!
Kamala Harris doesn't know what nationality or ethnicity Kamala Harris is,, she'll be whatever you want her to be as long as it gets her to be the president! She has no interest in the vice presidency she's just biding her time to deem Biden unfit if he wins!
I don’t care for trump but anybody “settling” for Biden is just showing the Democrats that they’re able to have anybody as a candidate which is the lowest standard, if you plan on being better than the Republican Party at least vote somebody in who is actually better
#PresidentTrump did this... Biden didn't.

I know that in general, more information is "always good." However, this information is meaningless.  If Biden wins, then the list is Biden 99.9%, All Others 0.01%. Why are we even bothering to talk about a presidential election that has no context?
I’m sorry. Maybe I’m not a true progressive thinker but wishing death on people like kamala and joe biden ain’t my cup of tea. That’s disgusting and just not my style.
This is what a Biden / Harris presidency will look like, A DICTATORSHIP FOR ALL. HE'S MAKING DEMANDS ALREADY AND HE'S NOT EVEN PRESIDENT YET!
i am participating in the election TO DISRUPT. i dont want the DEMOCRATS to win,i want the LITERAL FASCIST out of one of the most powerful offices on the planet. unfortunately, that means a vote for biden at the time being. im not planning on letting the dems sit pretty jfc
aaaaaand we are back to the false choice thing you did at the beginning. i am going to vote for biden AND THEN BULLY AND ADVOCATE AND PROTEST FOR THE COMPLETE ABOLITION OF THE POLICE its not that complicated of a position to understand
Well, great! We only get to decide between two men accused of rape! And we have a rapist on the Supreme Court! But I think the world will be made worse with Trump, so I will vote for Biden and hope Harris will replace him...although I prefer Warren.
Lol. I would say the Dems are so desperate they would run a wooden dummy for president and and as it turns out they are, and they know it. Again want their way- hiding  Biden’s mental defects behind a wall of opacity.
If their going to blantly lie why stop at something this meaningless?  Why not say if they win, Kamala and Biden will put all the people who don't support BLM in concentration camps.  Fuck it if your gonna lie go big
IMO, the defining question (and presumptive lesson learned) that this election reprises is, “Will this prove to be a best foot forward?”
did you read my whole tweet or did u literally stop at "marx would advocate voting for biden" its really weird it seems like you only are responding to this tiny piece of my whole argument whats that called again?
marx would advocate for voting biden and continue doing social and leftist work outside of that. he disagreed with political accelerationism, because it doesnt really tend to work. he favored economic accelerationism, things like general strikes. maybe you need to read up

Thank you for your service Steve! Also, thanks for being a patriot and voting for Joe Biden
you guys keep framing this as a choice, like if i vote i have to stop going to protests and shit. I CAN VOT FOR BIDEN TO SAVE SOME LIVES AAAAAANNNNDDDDD STILL ORGANIZE THATS THE WHOLE POINT
Thank you for your service and thank you for voting for Biden!
You are my only viewer. Also, who did Joe Biden rape? Feel free to talk about his crime.

Trump calls out Biden for 'politicizing the pandemic': 'Appalling lack of respect for American people'
like i dont disagree with anything you said. its still better for the literal survival rate of trans/lgbt BIPOC with biden in office
do you really believe that the material conditions for marginalized people will be identical under either biden or trump?
and i advocate for both. but it is much easier for us to do real work under a milktoast liberal instead of an actual FASCIST. voting for biden is a utilitarian act to stop some bleeding in marginalized communities. i dont have any delusion of it being a radical move

Biden supports Communism.
Trump desperately claims Biden will lock Americans ‘in their basement for months on end’
even if every leftist in this country voted green they would never get enough ground to even come close to competing with either of the established political parties. the sad reality is it is either biden or trump, and getting the fascist out is a top priority for me
okay and? they arent lying, they are deluded. the only people lying when they say biden is far left are conservatives
Joe Biden: For The Next 3 Months, All Americans Should Wear A Mask When Outside
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris call for nationwide mask mandate – live
Clinton was kinky, Bush wasn't (he was busy painting), Obama was and let's not even talk about Biden
Biden/Harris said:"We’ll create millions of jobs &amp; fight climate change through a clean energy revolution,"  Seems they started the partnership smoking crack together. This will kill millions more jobs.  p.s. They want union work = Sky-rocket cost
any actual leftists voting for biden are keenly aware he isnt progressive at all. the endless strawmanning is getting exhaustinggggg
Biden and Kamala represent the Dem. party very well.
Biden/Harris like our lives depend on it, because they do.
This is OUTRAGEOUS OVERREACH!   REQUIRE Montana, the Dakota's, &amp; rural areas a mask EVERY-TIME they step outside?  HALF of STATES: 1000 DEATHS OR LESS.  15 states LESS THAN 500. 5 less than 90.  #coronavirus  #kamalaharris
I couldn’t agree more!!  I don’t have time to listen to a bunch of negative crap about Biden and Harris. Anyone I see that says they better do this, I’m sitting this one out or they’re voting third-party I will immediately block. I’m done with the negativity.
In fact, I'd argue that Biden's plan should go a step further and abolish all homeowner's associations, because seriously, fuck those things.
Five thirty eight has given Biden the same exact odds of winning that they gave Hillary. Down to the exact number. And they’re supposed to get these things right?
He waited to endorse Biden in 2020 hrs.
Gotta love you, &amp; just for that, I too will go donate to Biden/Harris2020, you’re awesome, God bless you🙏
Also when i replied it had Biden at 68%
funny stuff in cartoon version but in real life Biden is a pedo
'Antifa' website cited in conservative media attack on Biden is linked to — wait for it — Russia
Trump I understand you are busy but I feel you need to get rid of Biden and his new VP choice. I have a feeling if it can be done those two will raise taxes by trillions of dollars. If it can be done lock in it raise taxes only by a 1% -2% only no more lock in for 10 years
They didn't take them. We surrendered them.  " When you give up a little freedom for a little security, you deserve neither" "those who forget history are destined to repeat it" "Joe Biden is a pervert and Kamala harris has put more nonviolent Black people in jail than alabama"
Me filling out my ballot for Biden/Harris even though I don’t support them but they’re better than the nasty Cheeto in office and we’re stuck in a corrupt two party system so it literally comes down to the lesser of two evils
E) Biden will certainly win, barring extreme election interference, and I'm sick of all of this shit. My vote, like most American's is pointless. Democrats have been the centrist/conservative party since the 90s, when the GOP went full on batshit insane. Rabbitholes...
Them:who you voting for   Me:Biden/Harris  Them(POC):we shouldn’t be voting for Biden   Me:(A whole black man):
Fox “news🤡” is a clown car, a joke to all intelligent people and a playpen for mental midgets. I.e. Tucker Carlson the nut job.

No, I just exaggerate. But there is pushback on Biden from Arab-Americans because they want him to take a stand for Palestine. Which he obviously cannot do and expect to become president, of this country at least.
Biden/Harris: a ticket every real American can vote for: good-bye fascism  #Biden #Harris #2020Election #Democracy #Trump #Fascism
I don’t know how DEM supporters can pretend to be excited about the Biden Harris ticket. Neither stand out as leaders, or visionaries. They have no ideas of their own. They will take their orders from the unseen powers.
Neither Biden or Harris will lead. They will take orders from their overlords.
Hey Beijing Biden:  Trump is cleaning up the messes you left behind.  Lousy Trade Deal.  Energy Independence.  ISIS and Terrorists.  Afghanistan.  NATO.  Russia, China, Iran, North Korea.  Growing our economy.  You would take us backwards.  No thanks.  MJ
Isn’t this how Biden selected his list of VP candidates? 😂 Georgia clothing store called 'racist' for appointment fee policy | Fox News
Maybe he really wants to see Biden/Harris in the WH? 🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
I have a crazy theory, the other democrats were beating her up worse than expected, so biden told her to drop out, now that he's made her the VP nominee he'll drop out she'll pick coumo as VP
won't endorse Biden until he says we gotta push Israel into the sea
I have no talent for drawing comics but I’m realizing how much potential fame and fortune awaits anyone who can can weave the needle of “Ben Garrison, but for Biden”
Biden is the president for the working man, as is shown here.   Terrible Ad!
If AniFa were white supremacists - which they are not, they’re Biden voters - you would be right.
Trump should demand to see Biden’s medical records .. 👍
This election is t about Joe Biden &amp; Trump. It’s Nationalism vs Globalism Socialism
This will come back and bite her and Joe Biden because they're counting on that millennial vote! Well this just destroyed it lol!
“Stip criticizing our very easily criticizable candidates for the highest title in the world, ya know the one with the power to deploy about 3 million troops worldwide? The one that’s funding concentration camps along our border? The shit that Biden won’t stop! Ohkaithxbai”
Only thing they were missing was one stuttering fool who can't compose two coherent sentences but wait a minute Joe Biden was there lol!
I agree I just don't want to waste my time with DHD, People's Party because its going to take them a while to think logically about this.  I rather focus on the people who are unhappy about voting Biden but will vote for him and grow from there.
We're on the same page as far as persuasion.  I want to influence Democratic voters and I think the way to do it is by being part of their circle not outside as DHD, People's Party. That means supporting Biden/Harris for now and pitching in Yang immediately after the election.
That's exactly my point. The people who are voting for Biden/Harris have a close relationship with the Democratic party and each other. It's its own bubble. And it's easier to influence if we're inside that circle.  We won't be able to do it as outsiders.
Biden/Harris...somehow, I feel like I’ll finally be able to get a full nights sleep after they take out the trash on January 20th. 😉
This is the kind of control we do not want a BIDEN/HARRIS TICKET WILL RESULT IN ALL OF OUR FREEDOMS BEING TAKEN AWAY! THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING.
This poll is gross. How could anyone vote Biden/Kamala? They must be blind and deaf!
Watching news media publish Biden/Trump poll numbers is honestly laughable but also annoying. I don’t have a short memory and 2016 is too fresh. I don’t see much trust in these polls.
I live In a rural area.  I'm voting for Biden.  Call me a cowboy, call me whatever.. it's that Wild West thing that drives me for Biden and Harris.   Not Trumpy's Regime of violence.   I'm on a self serving lockdown at our homestead from the Republican virus.  I'll live to vote.
Thank god for Biden. I feel so warm and comfortable again. It's amazing. I see the promise land coming. .  I don't see Mexico paying for a wall, or health care in his first 100 days or a "rock head" on Mt Rushmore
I'll take Biden/Harris over the fascist GOP any day!
Kamala Harris could get up there and stutter and spew gibberish just like Joe Biden and they would say it is all gold! This media has no shame!
Just saw ad saying Biden/Harris will lead us out of the covid-19 pandemic. I wonder how they can do that!!! Are they going to breathe in all the germs so that the rest of us no longer have to worry????
I give it 10 years and Iraq will be carved up like a Thanksgiving turkey, unless Biden gets elected and decides to restart us interventionism.
HEY!! Everyone settle down. Joe Biden just called her CARMELLA. 😎🇺🇸
Joe Biden just pronounced it CARMELA. What? No reply?
I'm now over 60% convinced Biden will not be the nominee, Cuomo the executioner will end up being kamel toes VP
You're exactly right and we're not only fucked because of Biden possibly winning but the fact that Kamala Harris will take over as president shortly thereafter!
I hope America wakes up before November because if not Biden and Harris will destroy this country!
CNN and MSNBC will cover Biden and Harris up until the point to where questions need to be answered then they'll cut away to something else!
I have noticed that both Biden and Harris now will not take any questions at all or if they do take some they'll all be softball questions?? They will continue to hide from the media until November if they're allowed to!
That's exactly right, Kamala Harris will do and say anything to become president even having to denigrate herself and work under Joe Biden until she deems him unfit and is president herself!
Rest assured Kamala Harris is in this to be President she could give a shit less about being vice president she will be there to deem Joe Biden unfit less than a year in office!
Nothing; and I mean nothing scares me more than Biden and Harris winning the election.
Biden’s not a rapist, Harris isn’t transphobic; vote for the one who will do less harm to the marginalized.
You don’t care because it doesn’t fit your narrative. Obama was eager for Hillary and more than reluctant for Biden.
it’s depressing you let the perfect become the enemy of the good. Don’t back the orange turd, remember all the appointments Biden would make #SaveThePostOffice
Everyone will sleep better tonight knowing that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have got this. #BidenHarris2020
Great speech by ⁦⁦ ⁦ video of ⁦ presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee, formally introduced Sen Harris
Both parties are far right and serve corporate donors. They’re literally the same party. As far as the candidates go this time around, they’re both senile warmongering racist rapists so there’s not a lot of difference there either. Biden just rapes less.
And I just cried off my night cream.  Thank you for making the calls and sharing it with us. Heart wrenching and inspiring. Joining my Biden Harris phone banking training tomorrow afternoon!

My husband, my grandsons, their friends and I have her back, I’m thankful to be part of their first presidential election as they cast their vote for Biden/Harris2020, it’s so exciting, I’m a proud gramma🙏❤️🇺🇸❤️🙏
You need background. Biden will support and enhance Obamacare. A US version of UK’s NHS? Great idea, but will never survive a Republican filibuster. We’re talking about a country that can’t even agree to wear masks in a pandemic. Trump wants to eliminate Obamacare. Biden doesn’t.
The possible trap I can see is if Biden wins, the left hammers down harder with their ideology and socio-pressures.  If Trump wins, then they hammer down with the riots and violent socio-pressures.
Biden-Harris so excited long live the Democratic Party.Get out and vote this November🥰

what's great is I predicted all of these replies in  my 2nd tweet.  It buys us time. Biden and Harris buy us time. trump keeps the clock ticking against us.
Notice Joe says, "If," not "when." And KAMALA is "ready to lead on day one." Your vote is for a far left VP who will take over quickly, bc they won't have a minute to lose. Biden's. Own. Words.
I remember Black groups harping on the fact that Kamala locked them up in record fashion...so did Biden for that matter.
I'm sorry but if you think Kamala Harris is a good pick for VP then you're actually a fucking idiot. She called Biden a racist that is guilty of his sexual harassment cases, imprisons a ton of small offenders, lengthed sentences for prison labor and jailed/fined parents.
To all at Fox Lies, your lame ass attacks on Biden &amp; Harris are totally, damn ignorant &amp; just plain moronic! America knows you are paid whores &amp; prostitutes for Ruppie Murdoch!  You will  burn in HELL! 11/3/2020 is Defeat Day for Drumpf!🇺🇸✌️

My hands are waving in the air, #Biden/Harris2020🙏❤️🇺🇸❤️🙏
Seriously? Trump is 30-50 minutes late to every presser he's ever held, the media hasn't complained once. Biden is delayed once due to a power outage and suddenly the knives come out.

You're very confused as usual Mr. Biden, HE SAID I QUOTE THERE ARE GOOD PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ISSUE, THE ISSUE BEING WHETHER TO TAKE DOWN THE STATUE OR NOT IN QUESTION.
With Joe Biden's very toxic VP pick  can't really support the Biden/GoldDigger ticket with a straight face. The two will make for "The Greatest Show on Earth" until #November3rd when it all ends. Glad to see Trump will get 4 more years now. #DemsElectionFraud

It’s a lousy ticket. But Democrats will vote for Biden. Republicans will vote for Trump. And the election will be decided in the “battleground states” by Independent voters who will vote against the candidate they hate more. Presidential elections are that simple.
for you saying you didn’t watch Biden &amp; Harris speech, you sure comment on every single subject, on everything thing said, you are sure a pathetic loser, I can’t wait for the day you’re escorted (in handcuffs) off the people’s property, Americans property🙏🇺🇸🙏
Looking forward to her Biden administration replacement, who will be capable and ethical.
Harris is a phoney. Biden just lost his bid for president by hand-picking a gold digger whose been handed everything including every job she ever held. Her prosecutorial record of putting away innocent black men in California ended her nomination. Buh bye.
Biden and Harris will look great in the room!!!

(2)I've said it before: Biden and the DNC are holding us hostage. trump is the gun. But if you give me the choice, I'll choose the hostage taker over the gun any day, because with the hostage taker, I at least have a chance at survival.  The gun has to fucking go.
You're preaching to the choir. I have a lot of trouble voting for Joe Biden. He's awful. AWFUL. He's responsible for some of the worst legislation in US history.  I 100% maintain he is 𝘭𝘦𝘴𝘴 𝘣𝘢𝘥 than trump, however, and that with Biden, we'll at least have a chance to live.
Trump doubles down after being confronted with his claim Biden wants an ‘invasion’ of suburbs
well its ridiculous because its a mischaracterization of my position. im not voting for biden to shake up the system. im voting for biden to save lives while we shake up the system. a vote will 0bviously never change systemic issues. its a utilitarian action to reduce harm
well you are right about 1 thing, next year WILL be better because YOU WONT BE IN OFFICE, President Biden &amp; Vice President Harris will make it better, they put themselves aside &amp; work for the American people
Donald Trump is a liar liar liar, you’re evil, you are DONE, hey Diaper Don, you’re a LOSER! bye bye Donny Done! Stop you’re lying, EVERYONE knows you’re lying, so many, SO MANY Republicans are swearing to vote for Biden, so many say “I’m an ex-republican because of trump”

She checked all of Biden's boxes. Unfortunately.
this take is dumb and i dont have enough characters in a tweet to debunk it but basically, not a single lefty on earth is voting for biden and expecting systemic change from it. lefties are voting biden to save marginalized lives. organizing happens outside electoral politics.
Joe Biden/Kamala Harris is a conservative ticket. Paleo Republican if you will...
Who is trump?  After listening to Biden and Harris today I feel hope again. Why listen to donny downer?
Biden and Harris going after Trump is exactly what they need to do, bully the bully, its the thing Hilary didnt do enough of, go after him and make him lose his shit and prove how incapable his is to lead
OUTSTANDING🙏❤️🇺🇸❤️🙏ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING! Biden/Harris2020 give me hope for our country, hope for the world, I know our allies watched and they too now have hope, &amp; our enemies &amp; djt &amp; co are running scared now, praise God, #Biden/Harris2020

I love that  and  are going old school with Harris attacking the orange cur in the  That leaves Biden free to talk big picture, unity, vision stuff. It also sets up Harris for a future presidential run from day 1.  This team is smart and excitingRegardless, it is still President Trump. Biden wins the polls and the popular vote and Trump wins the Electoral College, you happy with that?
If he is losing to Biden and the polls are correct, then why are the Dems going nuts trying to establish national mail in ballots, why are they panicking about the ability of the USPS to handle the mail in ballots.  Trump is going to win.
Trump spoke to members of the City of New York Police Benevolent Association, the union representing some 24,000 rank-and-file officers as he steps up his attacks on Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris.
You Do realize Joe Biden is trying to say he and obama deserve most of the credit for this deal?
Let's just remember that because if Biden will win then the idea is probably also appealing to him right along with slashing Social Security.
Ah, our country is collapsing NOW!  Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris will be a refreshing change.
Wonder if the $48M Biden/Harris received in 48 hours was funneled thru BLM?
Basement Biden and Dems are so dead. They just don’t know it yet. No one is voting FOR riots, looting &amp; burning, or low income housing in suburbs. No one.

No one is pointing out what the spiced together words it has Biden saying. Did you hear the part about children? It’s sick
I will probably vote for  for ballot access, and because she is the closest to my values. I will also vote against ballot initiatives that spend money, or outlaw a noncrime... But, if Nevada goes for Biden, and he invades Syria, I'll feel guilty 🤷
Mostly state not federal issues but I wouldn't expect Biden to know that. Renters rights already exist in most states. Check out how the federal sexual assault survivors bill of rights was passed. As usual, had very little to do with the president at the time (Trump).
What’s worse is the words spliced together to make Biden say something dirty about children.
Biden and Harris thanks you for all of the donations
322 times in 60 days??? So he was going to his basement 5 times a day...  I have been out my house 4 times since beginning of march....  I probably walk through my house 100 times a day...   I don't get their point   I hear Biden every day: TV, twitter, emails, text, zoom, etc
He’s cut taxes so we get more money on paychecks. He’s built the wall like he said. He’s dropped prices of medical supplies. Created more jobs. Unemployment at an all time low until COVID. Biden has been in politics 40 years and done nothing.
has pissed me off. Biden has a new on YouTube. It's a fvcking joke. My camera is not here. Filed 2 complaints on sellers. Trying to get money back. Nothing working today.
I'm very curious what some, possible Biden voters think about this...        If Biden invades Syria, in 2021, and nothing else changes... You were conned by the greater evil, right?
I mean..   ... Do you actually believe this insanely optimistic estimate?  Trump went 4 years without starting a new immoral war of choice as president... Obama didn't with Biden as Veep. Did Biden ever complain?  I'm pretty sure Biden still gets me 20k Syrians dead+
I'll wait while you find the quote from Biden 'hollering' about closing flights to China.  The racist calling started when he extended the ban to some African countries for no reason (they still have nowhere near as many cases as us) a couple of weeks later, because it was racist

The USPS Workers Union has endorsed Biden. Conflict of interest wouldn’t you say?
Soooo what you’re saying is you’d rather vote AGAINST Trump rather than FOR Biden? And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how a republic dies a slow death. Biden is doing as little as possible and thinks it will be enough to earn the highest office in the world. I don’t think so.
On betonline Biden is -135, Trump is +1.05. They have odds on each state too. FL -1.55 Dem, AZ -145 Dem, etc. Based on state odds, here is how EC map looks. Biden easy winner.
FWIW, betonline has odds:  -135 Biden, +105 Trump. Was -180 Biden last week. Doesn't make sense as they have odds for each state. Biden in -155 FL, -145 AZ, etc. Based on state odds, here is EC map. Biden wins easy.

. Hey Sean, is this your ad against Biden? Clever! Now it is evident who is dufus and it ain't Biden!         *get someone to explain this for you #DementiaDon
Now why is it you report on this but you don't report on  hiding in his basement and refusing to debate  or Biden ignoring questions about having cognitive testing done. He has brain damage and should be disqualified from race. Unfit for POTUS.
I see a problem with the postal union endorsing Biden when Democrats are trying for mass mail-in vote fraud.
You got one thing right, you’re a bitch.  The Trumps have done more for the Black Community than you, Obama and Biden ever have. You are a disgrace to your race. #WalkAwayFromDemocrats #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica
IDK, Biden is +4.5 in AZ and 9.2 here. It's a dramatic turn.   Either way, wear what you wear and don't apologize.
🤣🤣🤣🤣oh, 🐴💩 Get your head out of Biden's arse, and see what is really going on!
I personally don’t dislike him, he has debated some right winger and completely smashed them, but when debating other leftists, well, it’s a lot messier. Rn I think he’s getting a lot of flak because of his support for Biden and using Marxist theory uphold his position
Truthfully - he has spent his entire life dividing this great country of ours - and adding you to the ticket, will only further that divide!  BTW:  you were so certain about your low opinion in Biden, what changed your mind?  🤔
When Biden steps aside, I will be so excited.
Team Biden announced several new hires in Nevada today, including former members of Teams Warren, Kamala and Castro.

This should show every American how little respect Biden has for we the people. He thinks if he lies to you your stupid enought to believe him. Pelosi said in hot mic Americans are the stupidest people in the world. Dem are LYING
Except FedEx is aloud to open any package they want meaning they can open voting mail if it went through them and just throw out ones for Biden to skew the votes. USPS is not aloud to open private mail
22 emails from Biden's campaign today with 6+ hours still to go.
He signed to executive orders to force the Democratic leader back to negotiate a fair bill for America. He is a great negotiator, unlike Biden he can spell it!
CCP and the Kuomintang hated each other but came together to fight Japanese Imperialism, once they won that conflict they got back to vying on who was going to run the country. So are you so disillusion that you think 4 more years of Trump will make your life than with Biden/Harr
Your anecdotes mean nothing to me. I don’t know or care what your credentials are. Your argument about Biden has been ass the whole time I’ve been corresponding with you. You assume I take you as an enemy so I treated you like that. But you’re wrong on Biden.
I Will Vote Democrat But Will not Donate until Biden Harris promise publicly they will PROSECUTE everyone that have broken the law including Treason We need JUSTICE, they need to be made an example, this cant happen again 45 is leaving behind a HowToGuide to detroy our country
Shove your statue. I want universal health care, pro-choice, a fucking functional USPS, expanded unemployment benefits, increased CV19 testing, a coherent CV19 plan based on SCIENCE, protection of SS and Medicare, no more nepotism, and Biden as Pres.
You have to prove Biden is harm reduction. From historical analysis we can say that’s definitely not a thing to accept as a given.
As usual you are awesome Rose💙💙💙💙
The double standard the media has for Biden and trump is astonishing.  Biden has to be perfect; trump, no.
Biden/Harris is closer to my values then Trump. Not a 100% which nothing ever is. Obama wasn't but definitely more than Romney and McCain could ever be. Revolutions invariable have counter revolutions but 2 parties come together to fight an enemy despised by both. 1/2
Neoliberal actions such as trying to get us to vote for fucking Biden in place of organizing actual direct action is what made you my enemy, dummy.

Best voter database, Catalist, shows non-whites were 24% of 2016 turnout. So to get Biden up by 11, they had to oversample minorities by 13 pts.  Pollsters rig by undersampling whites, oversampling young, oversampling women, oversampling college grad+, usually a combo.
Shooting straight won’t do a lot of good when Biden takes away your guns while setting the Bible on fire on his way to hurt God.  Isn’t funny how scared these tough guys are?
I want a presidential Debate  Biden  vs Trump so we can just this election #Trump2020Landslide
Wow just basically got told to shut up about politics because I'm an immigrant by an ex Bernie campaign staffer (who I referred to the campaign) because I won't support Joe Biden. Damn she is a confused mess. LOL
According to Catalist, which studies have shown is most accurate on voter data, non-whites were 24% of 2016 turnout.  Every pollster showing Biden with a lead is undersampling whites by 7 pts or more.
You can hypothesize all you want but Biden’s actions directly gave the police authority to kill PoC indiscriminately, you don’t get to use utility as a bargaining chip. You have to admit you are using arbitrary ideas to select one equivalent evil over another. It means nothing.
Is that why rapist Biden takes and answers so many questions?
I think everyone appointed by Trump should go to jail when Biden crushes him
I'm being honest - I'm not thrilled with these options, I'm more left than Biden or Harris.  Im literally just asking what makes the most tactical sense? And what will help the most people RIGHT NOW?

Me:   Mail carriers endorsed Biden today. They are the ones who will handle our ballots. I think this election might be rigged.  My leftist bro: Why the fk would you think that!!!???!!!  Me:  Let me come pick up your ballot and turn it in for you.  My leftist bro:
why don’t you just call them Mr Biden, and Miss Harris. Try this instead of just insulting those running against you and actually discuss policies. Wait I understand you don’t have any policy other than cutting taxes for the Ultra Rich. That and erasing Pr.Obama.
It's as crowded as a Joe Biden rally. 😀
Biden is the candidate because nobody was willing to step away so Pete could finish Bernie, starting with NH which the press somehow made a 3 way race with Amy. I don’t know anything anymore after this fucking primary.
Laughing and crying (figuratively speaking) because there are democrats who are actually going to vote for two failed candidates for the Presidency! This Biden Harris ticket is a gift to the GOP! Don't fuck it up GOP!
Gawd, I hope so! It looks like they're doing more than the democrats in washington. Seems like the dems are out maneuvered by the RUSSIAN REPUBLICAN POLITICIANS and The Party "leader".  I'm with Fightin' Biden and Nasty! Make Democracy and the Rule of Law Great Again!
I literally just saw a quote from Biden taking partial credit for this. Ridiculous!
Are you talking about the same usps that officially endorsed biden? The same usps that biden is telling President Trump is out to destroy? The primary ballots I received, (6 for a house w/2 registered voters) had party affiliation on the envelope. Nope!
Obama, Biden as well.
He probably shouldn't unless his internal polling show it a reasonably close race.  If he does make a play, it will scare the shit out of the Biden campaign, force them to spend money there, and spread Joe and Kamala....ahem...thin.
I’m also not a fan of Biden, but hasn’t tRump done enough damage already? He had his shot, he drove our nation to the ground. He’s done. Why is that so hard to understand?
You still not back on? The last thing I posted, I think, is that Kamala Harris is Biden’s VP. I was neither overly joyous nor distraught in that post either.
We have built a criminal legal system specifically designed to oppress people of color???  You’re 100% right, both you and Biden have been in the politics for like 40 years! So give yourself a pat on the back for your racist policies! 😂🤣😂 freakin 🤡
Joe Biden: "We are better than this moment than we are in."
Okay so you are voted for racist Joe Biden in good concise. Make that one make sense?
Our kids have been in cages since Biden wrote the crime bill bitch, what have you done to stop that?
Yes. This is what leftists mean when they say “voting Biden is harm reduction” It’s not “vote Biden then stop everything we’re doing” It’s “vote Biden so less people die while we keep pushing, even harder.”
Someone telling you that you are wrong is not cyber bullying Jacqueline
In the NV primary I received 6 ballots with only 2 registered voters in the house. They also had a checkbox on the outside of the envelope for party affiliation. The USPS union has endorsed biden and all the leftists are screeching that potus is trying to destroy the USPS. 🤔
I know y’all don’t like Fox News I can get you a different source 👀 or 👁👄👁
Reuters/Ipsos poll sample is 50% Democrat-leaning, only 37% GOP leaning, to get Biden to +7.  Biden is down bigly, not just a couple of points.
In 2012 I was working out of state and had to prove to NV that I was by sending a pay stub from my employer in UT to get a ballot. What they want to do is send ballots out like those landscaping service flyers you get every day in your mailbox. USPS endorsed biden. It’s a scam.

If Trump can have his acceptance speech in the White House then the DNC should request that Biden should be able to have his in the White House. He is a former Vice President after all. Equal time.
You’re correct, and he has broken the law so many times no one could keep track.  There’s nothing Biden &amp; Harris could do to come close.  I don’t want to hear complaints from magats.  I can play “what about,” too.
I’m serious, I just can’t take black folks voting for Biden serious, when his track record is well known. Voting for him is literally the definition insanity.

It is good to know that  mail carriers who endorsed Joe Biden for president will be handling my mail in ballot. I'm sure they will be honest.
So excited for Biden-Harris!
Biden should be nervous, we now know he was involved in FBI LYING to get a warrant. Biden and Comey hopefully will see for prison time. More coming soon!!

I believe the specific words he said was "In certain cases" which is way different than the blanket bill Biden wrote.
Yes he did.  At that time, he explained his vote (women domestic abuse provisions, if I remember), trashed the part resulting in mass incarceration, and SPENT HIS LIFE TRYING TO FIX.  Biden/Harris still embrace that bill to this day.
Hell, they're already calling Joe Biden a commie, and he's about as conservative as the Dems come  What makes anyone think the black lady cop who once endorsed M4A is going to attract people who think Joe Biden was pals with Joe Stalin

Ok - fair point. But that has little to do with the actual election. I know that the Constitution is very clear about Trump's term ending at 12:01pm on Jan 20. Biden said he'd have him dragged out if necessary.

Joe Biden dodges every question and you have been pushing a bogus conspiracy theory since January 2017.  Go fk yourself.
I don't like it. But I'm not going to advocate not voting at all. I don't even see it as voting for Biden/Harris. I see it as vote for taking Senate, letting RBG fucking retire, prosecuting Trump, saving DACA/ACA/LGBT rights, protecting courts, COVID action, removing DeVos/Miller
Yeah...I can definitely see a lot of queer and non-white people not voting this year because of the Biden/Harris ticket and at this point can you blame them? It’s four more years of stagnation either way and we don’t have a lot of the privileges to fall back upon.
You are making the incorrect moral choice as you are predicating your argument on a assumption that Biden is any better than trump which you have failed to provide evidence for.
Hard to believe Biden/Harris has officially been a ticket to run for the President and VP for 48 hours and neither candidate has taken a single question from a journalist. That’s got to be a first.
Because  1) the thread is about not voting Biden and 2) the what about you just used to try to refocus the conversation on trump can absolutely be said about Biden- He’s very into cutting social programs and would do so immediately once in.   Direct action is what fixes it.
I have a hard time with that because Biden won the primaries with many states having record turnout, especially among southern black voters. I wasn't happy about it either, but that's how shit went. So now it's time to let the fascist roll over everybody?
Trump's events in Mankato, Minnesota, and Oshkosh, Wisconsin, are being billed as remarks on Biden's “failures on Jobs and the Economy.”
Biden announced he is going to expand Medicare coverage and drop the eligibility age to 60. Also that he is going to look at forgiving student loan debt to ppl making less than $125k per year. He has made moves more to the left Also, if Biden doesn't win the Supreme Court is lost
Honestly I think all these polls showing Biden’s lead are all skewed. Unless we can seriously bring out the vote in the swing states, I think Trump will surprise everyone again in November
Tellingly, neither will vote for Trump.  At least one will vote for Biden.
Raymond Arroyo: Is Kamala Harris Biden's shadow president?   Who is the first woman president, Kamala Harris or Jill Biden? Cleary Biden is impaired and hiding his limitations.
I cannot respect that sentiment because it doesn’t pay appropriate respect to just how horrible the things joe Biden has already done to lead us down the path of dictatorship. People calling that shit harm reduction are being dishonest or ignorant.

Just dawned on me that ABC, Obama, Biden all Tweeted the same thing today---If you are thinking that ABC is part of the #Democrats Propaganda machine -- you are right.
MLK is rolling over and over in his grave because Biden chose by color of skin and not the underlying character of his VP choice. Democratic govenors across the country are keeping thing closed down so Trump won't get credit for the booming economy that was strong.
Girlfriend, the reason I am voting 4 Trump is BC I’m a Christian. I truly think the NWO and tribulation is coming under Biden’s power, which will really be the radical lefts power. God warns us of the end times in revelation, a lot lines up w what the left has done this past year

Just a little tweet to remind everyone that "Mandatory BuyBack" means Confiscation under threat of punishment.  Voting for Joe Biden and Ms. Kamala is voting to overturn the 2nd amendment.  Choose wisely.
Don’t vote if you can’t stomach Biden but don’t call yourself a Christian and support this evil. You can’t justify it. Don’t even say abortion. You have zero valid reasons to call yourself a Christian and vote for the anti-Christ. We need you to be reasonable
I felt Hope and found it a breath of fresh air and feelings if stability as I watched Biden and Harris. Like coming out of a really bad dream was possible.
One heck of a quote here: “I’m dealing with this brutal stuff, dog-eat-dog in school, and then I would come home and we would all stand by the toilet and wave bye to a piece of shit,” Harris recalled in 2018. “It will put this place in perspective.”

Biden wanted to do the same thing though.
And they think BIDEN knows something? Idiots
The DNC knows Biden wouldn't make it a full year if elected. They know that the liberals wouldn't vote for a black(?) woman to be POTUS. (they wouldn't in the Primary). So stick her in as a placeholder VP and shoot for the vagina/black sympathizer vote. Pray for a win by default.
Biden/Harris 2020!! To be honest, like a lot of others the Biden ticket wasn’t my top choice (miss ya Bernie!) but I am joining my top choices in supporting them and they are definitely my top choice over our other…

I’m proven right again. I told you so. I told you black Democrats didn’t vote for Kamala in primary. They don’t like her. Biden blew it. Bad pick. Why would someone who did NOT get black vote in primary bring out black vote in main election? Dems so stupid

I was going more to “Biden chose a slut that blew her way up the political chain”- but that AJ comment is pretty good...
Biden’s consistent and recent language only demonstrates his deep seated polarization of minorities calling them not diverse thinkers or not a very diverse group. “Ain’t black” isn’t exactly Progressive, it’s Regressive.
Don't forget that Biden is practically brain dead!
This one IS political. But more Obama vs. Biden &amp; differing styles. Great read.  "If Biden wins, many Ds &amp; Rs believe that at least relations between the White House &amp; Congress will be better than in any other recent administration, including Obama’s."

Get a clue! If Biden was in charge there would have been millions of people killed. He denigrated Trump’s closing of travel with China/Europe. Biden never would have closed borders or the economy and millions more would have died. Just like Cuomo killed thousand in NY rest homes.

No. Bought and paid for by Soros and the DNC and apparently Joe Biden since his website comes straight from the Antifa site.
1. Biden is more in the center than the State of Kansas.  That's *after* shifting left.  2. Good, we need higher taxes on those earning over $1mil/yr.  3. They're not going to enact universal healthcare, the corporate sponsors of the DNC would never allow it.
Of course they want Biden.  That way the USA can keep getting taken advantage of and never, ever, prosper.

It is too late in the day to express shock at anything that drips from Donald Trump's lips.  #NewsBriefs
Now Joe Biden has selected Kamala Harris as his running mate, we must double down on our efforts to boost Democratic Voter Turnout in November. Because to defeat Trump, every Democrat, Independent, and anti-Trump Republican will need to vote for Biden &amp;Harris. #VoteBidenHarris
I get it. Not exactly a huge fan of Biden. Had my eye on others, including Kamala. Cuz y'all not a fan of the ticket, doesn't mean not voting. CAN'T EVEN be an option. Unless you want 4 more years of...🤡  Teaming up with Harris...mic drop Let's go! #vote
We’re not voting for Joe “you ain’t black” Biden... He’s a true racist with His voting record and racist history to prove it and you still refuse to believe it! When will you guys wake up and Stop covering for him.
As you know, Obama/Biden were behind the passage of UN Resolution 2334–not cool , especially for a lame duck president with 2 weeks left in his term.
The glib in the presentation of ka mala and Biden is the first step to failure
But I’m no dog faced pony soldier either man. On November 30330, 1987 I’m gonna do the thing, come on. Trumps a hack, clearly he doesn’t work for you, neither does the other biden! God bless kamala heiress
It’s the beginning of lie after lie after lie...Trump promotes another birther lie, this time about Kamala Harris
And I knew if Biden became the nominee he would pick Harris as VP it looks like my premonition was correct fortunately but unfortunately kinda depressing this election cycle
Never President Biden  His name is running not Joe.  Others are in charge,  Next President a woman with a plan to bring mrs Obama in   Hillarie’s course of action to manipulate the election
I would say governing isn’t about red or blue.. it’s purple.. no politician is the perfect match and for the system to work it is about compromise (purple). Biden can accomplish what we need accomplished.
Joe Biden did not choose Ka mala,Nancy and her crew did it!  He got to sleep with one eye open jjjjjjjj.
She didn’t give Biden the time of day during the Obama Administration.   If there’s a photo of them together it’s rare.  When she ran for President he wasn’t even mention🤔  True Story
Liar. Obama/Biden had 8 years and made nothing happen. Your statement was debunked this morning by the ambassador.
She Was The Little Girl Having To Be Bussed .Being Nasty To Biden    Now Its All Peaches &amp;  Cream.          Two Faces...
Rich people don't stimulate the economy. The middle income tax payer has is the greatest effect on consumer speeding and strengthening government funding. The current tax bill stifled growth in the economy and stifled government funding. Biden's tax bill reverse  the tend
This is not correct.. Joe Biden's tax policy puts these 16 consumer company stocks at risk: Goldman Sachs the new green economy and Job growth will ad more consumers putting more money in the economy.
AMEN!!! The democrats can't do anything and the RUSSIAN REPUBLICAN POLITICIANS won't do anything.  I'm with Fightin' Biden and Nasty! Make Democracy and the Rule of Law Great Again!
AMEN!!!  I'm with Fightin' Biden and Nasty! Make Democracy and the Rule of Law Great Again!
Giuliani's daughter Caroline announced her support for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Next is a crucifix and some garlic for dad. #BidenHarris2020
Not guaranteed, but... Otherwise, more fear mongering. Usual RUSSIAN REPUBLICAN POLITICAN tactic. They all need to go back to Moscow and DADDY PUTIN.  I'm with Fightin' Biden and Nasty! Make Democracy and the Rule of Law Great Again!
Yeah, but that's what he and his RUSSIAN REPUBLICAN POLITICIANS know. That's what appeals to his base and to conspiracy theorists like QAnon (some of whom might be arriving on capitol hill soon to greet their fellow RUSSIAN REPUBLICANS}.  I'm with Fightin' Biden and Nasty!
She certainly has no future as a Democrat . Hillary is already in line for a position with Biden, can't imagine  the Biden team has reached out to Gaby.
The RUSSIAN REPUBLICANS are good at that. They've got some pretty good attack lapdogs. The democrats, wellll, yeah, anyway... But I think BIDEN and HARRIS are getting there, especially the speeches they made a couple of days ago.  I'm with Fightin' Biden and Nasty!
He's the original "birther." Let's see, he and his cronies went after OBAMA. And now, HARRIS. Hmmm...Clinton? Bush? Biden? Just OBAMA and HARRIS. Hmmm...what's the common denominator?  I'm with Fightin' Biden and Nasty! Make Democracy and the Rule of Law Great Again!
Voting for Trump or Biden is less about the man and more about the platforms. The socialist wave is real and unchecked will transform the US. Biden/Harris will not stand up to the extreme faction to the left of the dems... It’s a lot like 2012 GOP &amp; the Tea Party.
They know the real polls. They know they're going to lose. Landing on Biden /Harris. for 2020 Really? They're phoning the while thing in. It's a show election
And contributed to half this destructive behavior and policies  I already didn't like Biden as the candidate now I feel more repulsed now that he picked Kamala Harris as VP apart of me already knew it was coming but it's just grave disappointment I wanted to be wrong
That's correct and I knew Biden was gonna pick her for VP she is going to be the main character and figure and this whole campaign the presidency is really being groomed and the seat is being warmed for her lol  Can we say president Kamala Harris lol hahaha
If you vote for Biden you are voting for Antifa
Biden doesn't even remember where he lives. The Chinese virus and mask is a BS
You and Alzheimer Biden only purpose is destroy this country. Trump
Trump is losing. He will tell lies about Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and the Democrats, all day every day, until the election.
you're a "journalist?" It's 'Vice President Biden,' not 'Joe.' Your show is a disgrace. #FoxandFriends
How Biden’s Housing Plans Would Destroy America’s Suburbs
This whole trump lying this dumb. All politicians lie. If telling the truth mattered for politicians, Biden’s career would have been over 33-years ago when he lied about his scholarship and finishing top of his class at Syracuse law.
Obama/Biden spied - ruined lives. An ambassador and others killed, cash delivered to an enemy, Americans penalized for not buying your bs healthcare, China, and on and on ... and now you deny riots. Step down and give someone else a turn to be overpaid
They don't call him Hiden Biden for nothing😂
It's the end of the world and I'm voting for Trump.  If I die before November 3rd I'm writing in my will that I didn't vote for Biden.
Yep, we do. And yet, we have the right who condone &amp; excuse his behavior ('fake news!', 'it's just the way he talks!'). And the left pissed off &amp; refusing to vote for Biden because 'Bloomberg is going to speak at the DNC.'🙄  The Four Horsemen should be arriving any day now...
Kamala makes me nervous. Trump makes me confused. Biden is cringeworthy and politics will burn this damn country to the ground.
Trump does a hell of a lot better than Joe biden has done the many years he was in congress. You people need to wake up and stop believing everything your shit media tells you to
It's his constitutional right to be anti-Trump (or anti-Biden)
yeah saying we would have 15 cases in no time and it would just disappear.  or saying it was a hoax.  oh wait that wasnt biden, that was trump and the republicans.  idiots
True. But the present bar is buried under so much bullshit that all Biden has to do is find it again to achieve success.

Many ppl think that if Biden loses, it’ll kill the Democrats and cause a complete progressive surge but would it? Is it really worth risking four more years of Trump to find out? During a horrific pandemic and economic collapse?
I know that Obama and Biden didn’t cost 200K+ American lives. They didn’t sit idly by as Russians took bounties on our soldiers. They didn’t destroy American institutions. They had CONFIRMED cabinet officials. Yeah, focus on that cuz  bout to tear dat booty up. #ICU
Let the ppl jizz over Biden, as unfortunate as he is, whatever, I’ll pull the lever and hopefully he’s declared the winner and then we go on fighting from there. But at least DJT is unhappy, that’s nice
If any1 thinks #Biden #joebiden is running his campaign, think again. He has dementia &amp; will never hold office. Kamala already acting as if she is top of the ticket.    Text TRUMP to 88022! I stand with
Well let’s see, The Democrats want to bail out a poorly run Post Office. They are going to pin any failure on Trump. Postal Workers union like sheep support Biden. The Postal Workers AND Post Office will be a vital link for mail in votes. Does anyone else see a TRAIN WRECK coming

Ain't nobody trying to vote for Trump. We see reality. We know Trump and Biden/Kamala are equally terrible for the Black community. Your bar is pretty low when you said "she's not perfect" Kamala to this day is ignoring Black folks that need her help.

I didn't ask if you could vote. I said what floats your boat about Biden? You are relentlessly defending him. Why? What is good about him?
Not 4 the innocent babies who lose their lives bc some1 doesnt want them. And not after the left gets done w it. They r already trying 2 take away our 1st &amp; 2nd ammendment. We will be a communist cntry if Biden gets in office. And not like u think we r now, a REAL communist cntry
Qwant it, Duck it, Bing it.   Trump sucks. But the bullshit you're trying pretend into existence about Biden is worse.
"joe biden touching little girls"  Google it. CSPAN clips abound
Hahaha Lmfao this little twatt waffle needs to realize our country is falling apart with the president that we currently have in office. It's funny how they keep shouting that all this horrible stuff is what will happen if Biden is in office. What is the excuse with Trump now?
I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE TO THE STREETS IN MASSIVE #'S LIKE NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN!! FORCE "45" INTO HIS BUNKER UNTIL NOVEMBER 3RD,THEN DRAG HIS ASS OUT OF" OUR" WHITE HOUSE &amp; LET BIDEN/ HARRIS BEGIN THE REBUILDING OF AMERICA, BRING AMERICA BACK STRONGER, BETTER &amp; UNITED!!! VOTE..👍
You're the bootlicker kiddo. I'm actually curious why you are excited to vote for a racist segregationist with dementia. What is it that floats your boat about Biden? Serious question.
I’m voting against Trump, not for Biden
In November, not only do I want to see a Biden victory, but I am also looking forward to a humiliating landslide that shows that the American people strongly reject everything that is Donald Trump.
I’d vote Kanye before Biden. Biden has already proven he’s a detriment to the black community.
Did the democratic nominee running for the President of the United States, Joe Biden just tell us, "it's not about our rights." 😳🤪🤔
BRUH... Dude is either a complete Idiot or didn't do homework. Nigga you support BLM n everything you just said sounds like "Um... ah... well, Trump out of Office" Dude is supporting Joe Biden who fought to Jail Young Blacks to the maximum penalty. And Kamala Harris who did!! 😑

Joe Biden. I feel bad for you with dementia. My mom died of it do you know who she was, pretty much like you
The great part is Donald Trump will win this a landslide. As much as I respect you for intelligence, your voting for Biden I’m pretty sure that’s Dementia right.  That’s got to be hard to swallow
Biden claimed to be Catholic but then he told us that the 10 commandments didn't matter. Murder (abortion, assassinations for political gain) and Adultery (Child Sexual Abuse) is sometimes OK in his eyes. Socialism &amp; DNC are incompatible with Christianity.

Also big death numbers as well. People dying, children getting sick and dying. People are homeless and hungry, but you want to talk about the stock market. Do you think those people really care? Your golf trips while your constituents are dropping like flies. Now I'll vote Biden!
I suspect he’ll declare victory on November 3rd whether there’s a clear winner or not, just so he can say it was stolen from him when all of the votes are finally counted &amp; he’s lost. Create chaos w/his base. We know Biden won’t concede until all votes are counted.
It’s like Vaush fuckin said man Sorry xX_LibSlayer69_Xx, I’m gonna go with the guy who’s been fighting his entire life for socialism and vote Biden instead of whatever crackpot larpy nonsense will make trump win. I want to win. Not lose for fucking ever.

A former prosecutor and district attorney who calls for defunding the police department is radical! The way she called Biden out for being a sexist and a racist, then flip flopped to join his ticket is radical! Stop with the hypocritical and biased news!
Biden also risks losing the white supremacist vote with the selection of Harris as veep. I would trust Michael Gerson on that point.

Don’t forget....Biden can pronounce Yosemite, knows colorado is not a Mexico border state, pays taxes, doesn’t suffer from extreme narcissism, doesn’t react to conflict by making up retarded nicknames,doesn’t require a diaper change when someone is mean to him. He brings Maturity
Maybe it IS time to privatize #USPS.   #WarrenBuffett  come together and manage this service. The #NonProfit #AmericanPostalService.  Hire all ex USPS employees, #HireVeterans.  Then give it back to the USA after Biden is in office.
My thinking is if Biden/Harris win (which they probably will); I doubt Harris can win a general election in 2024. I *hope* Republicans learn their lesson about having a Trump type in office and put up a much better candidate in '24 such as Haley or someone else more like-able.
McConnell sends Senate home for a month without giving Americans virus relief    The Senate majority Leader is just as important as the Presidency,for the Biden/Harris ticket to win we must vote out Mitch McConnell if America is to fully heal and recover.

Biden doesn’t want that. He’s been in government this whole time and hasn’t done a damn thing different. It’s the same BS from both parties. Half of the stuff you’re saying she has spoke on already.
This is not the first time  plagiarized. Several times in past even in law school.
Funny Biden has to look down as if hes stepping over something.
The idea seems to be to portray Biden as racist. Can you explain why the cartoon is racist?
I don't get it. For poking fun at Biden for being opportunistic, that's racist? Did I miss the point, or did all of you?  Biden is a known liar and a plagiarist. Why is it so bad to accuse him of using people to achieve his goals?

Disgusting, even for #CNN, a disgrace to 'journalism.' I listened to presser, #Trump clearly did not give any opinion or claim any statement that #KamelaHarris isn't eligible for VP. This is becoming #Nazi type propaganda, and inspiring me to vote Trump.
It's possible if Biden and Kamala get power. Both want to give it all away, while he lives in a Dupont Mansion.
Joe Biden: Dumb as a bumble.
Kamala - Thank you so much for this opportunity.                                                 Biden - Huh?
Cali is certain. But still some trash that needs to go as well, such as NunCow and McCrap. Biden has to play for him and for the others.
What r the odds that Melania votes for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
Biden, Hunter and Kamalia all own stock in the Mask Corporation of America. This is why they want a mask mandate. Make a mandate and they get richer.
I probably won’t leave my house at that point, but that’s what they want, the powers that be 🔜We want  to expose the corruption of the Obama/Biden Admin and the illegal support they received from the Liberals in the Swamp. Go get ‘em Senator!
He’d be crazy not to vote for Biden.
"Like" our lives depend on it? More like IT ABSOLUTELY DEPENDS ON A TRUMP VICTORY! Doesn't matter that we KNOW no one in their right mind would vote for a criminal rapist like Joe Biden, it's OBVIOUS there are a few who are NOT in their right minds which means MAKE SURE YOU VOTE!
You are speaking of all the Laws Obama/Biden Admin &amp; 9th Circuit had overturned because they were unConstitutional. True, never let a Democrat near a position of Power—it is always abused by them.
I wish.  I know this giant headed 12 year old in a suit doesn’t remember how they tried that same trick on Obama and it didn’t work then either. Her and Biden would be Center right in most European countries. Still better than a far right fascist wannabe dictator.
Kerry was one bullet we missed. Hopefully we can dodge the Biden-Harris disaster, too!
Just got back from a Nevada road trip (no service, no people, wonderful!) to see that Dying Breed is coming out tomorrow and Biden chose Kamala Harris as his running mate! Damn! I gotta leave town more often! 👍👍👍
"Joe Biden and Kamala Harris couldn’t run a lemonade stand." They would make lousy lemonade, refuse to give refunds to dissatisfied customers (calling them sexist and racist), burn the stand to the ground, ask for a federal bailout, and call themselves successful.
Since when has Biden ever demonstrated common sense‽ 🤷‍♀️
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
I just had the voting Green for liberal purity’s sake argument with a friend. Fortunately she lives in California.   Yes, I know Biden is owned by Wall St but if you can’t see a basic moral difference between him and moron, I don’t know what to say.
Joe Biden accuser Tara Reade is demanding that media outlets question Kamala Harris about Reade’s sexual assault allegation against him, especially since the Democrats appear to be, in her words, enabling predatory behavior.
Every American should wear a mask outside for at least the next three months, Joe Biden demanded today during a virtual briefing on the coronavirus pandemic.
These script writers for this final season are just lazy &amp; predictable. Igor &amp; Lev? A deadly pandemic that forces Trump to cancel TWO Republican conventions? Trump questions the citizenship of Biden’s running mate? Too many cliches!
lies 24 f'n 7! He lied about: •Kamala Harris not be qualified         to run for VP •Biden politicizing #TrumpVirus •HIS administration following the science •EVERYTHING regarding #TrumpVirus cases, the death toll, &amp; testing •Voter fraud Did I miss anything?
“My lies are fabulous, absolutely amazing, believe me, they’re very luxurious lies! But creepy Joe Biden’s lies are sad, lazy, unAmerican socialist lies.”
It’s so odd that Mr Trump has never accused Joe Biden of birth certificate fraud, but Biden’s running mates’ birth certificates are both “suspicious” 🤔
That is 100% garbage!  Creepy Joe Biden and Chameleon Kamala do not have a chance to beat President Trump and VP Pence.  The Democrat leadership supports anarchy, defunding the  Police, open borders, higher taxes, China over America and late term abortion.  It’s appalling!!
It’s probably just a “coincidence” that Trump never accuses Joe Biden of forging a birth certificate, but Biden’s running mates are both engaged in birth certificate fraud? 😉
Remember the time Joe Biden tried to prevent states with governors he disliked from receiving vital medical supplies during the coronavirus pandemic?
trump calls for barr to investigate  Obama &amp; Biden. The AG should NOT be paid to conduct an investigation of one of trump's conspiracy theories! The  has gone completely off the rails!!! HE MUST BE STOPPED!!!
He’s accusing Mr Biden of having a vegan diet? That’s an odd, easily refutable allegation
Trump’s strategy is to shrink his party until all that’s left are the white supremacists  Biden’s strategy is to earn the votes of both leftists &amp; centrists  Is Biden’s strategy realistic? Maybe. Or maybe not. But at least he’s not deliberately leading his party on a suicide pact
All the things you're claiming will happen in a Biden administration we're dealing with right now under your administration!
Utah being the only one on the map with a D plus 40 is amusing to me. (Too bad it’s still not near enough to win, they just really love Romney there). Don’t like that Nevada’s a little redder but Obama won by 12 and 7 here and Hillary by 2. I think Biden’ll still take it)
wow I almost changed the channel. Biden’s words for the souls of America could mean something to me. Damn I don’t know what to think. Time will tell. LUC
This guy can't pronounce the word, 'fatalities'! He said, "fatilities", twice! Yet he challenges Biden's cognitive ability and brags about 'acing' a cognitive test. 🙄 Person*Woman*Man*Camera*TV🙄
I would be *delighted* if Donald Trump made Hunter Biden the main centerpiece of his re-election campaign. Voters don’t care about the virus, they care about Hunter Biden! It’s a winning issue, guaranteed to resonate with the 30 million unemployed Americans who can’t pay rent
Too much is "off-limits." Who cares what the Angry Mob says the rules are? We should be discussing Biden's crooked deals and Harris's racist policies. We should discuss child sex trafficking, long a taboo topic.
Remember the funny little videos obama and biden did. Those we were good times.  What I'm wondering is, WHEN he's elected, will Biden make some new videos with Harris? Cuz I'd like that 😁
Loss is a universal trait that all of us must occasionally endure. No matter your political views, we all experience grief.   For example, Joe Biden mourns the death of his son Beau Biden while Donald Trump mourns the death of his close friend Jeff Epstein 😢
Joe Biden mourns the death of his son Beau Biden while Donald Trump mourns the death of his close friend Jeff Epstein 😢
I realized after I said that, that if you don't know what venmo is...this sounds like a total scam haha so I don't fault you for declining. But you can check it out on an app store and see that its an accredited...so if you ever change your mind...Go Biden Harris! Best of luck!
More people turn out for high school football games than they did for a Biden-Harris rally.
Your last snort didn’t go well.   Who do you think will replace Joe Biden on the ticket?  Some say Michele Obama. As Ukraine closes in on Biden and actor Biden gaffs up more he will be able to use his diminsa as a defense.
Biden/Harris all the way
At the federal level, I doubt that the Biden Justice Dept will prosecute Donald. Biden will do the old “Lets look forward, not backward” nonsense.  I’m more optimistic about NY state charges
My cousin has the worst case of TDS I’ve ever seen- threw me out of her house last night when I asked her what Biden is going to do to solve all her problems after she told me he would do so if elected
....got away with stealing this election and they're now under the rule of Biden. It is NOT going to be pretty. A Biden regime WILL NEVER SEE ONE THING DONE IN TAX MONEY FROM ME and I have a bunch there are millions who feel the same. WE'VE SEEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN BIDEN IS IN...
Biden wants to fund the police MORE. Has he discussed his plan for reform at least?  Im not ecstatic about it, but they have my vote.
She did a lot of awful shit as AG and DA. Let’s get that out of our system  There’s two options.  I’m not going to trash her or Biden till after the election if I can help it. This isn’t Romney or McCain. We’re talking about a guy forming a dictatorship here. He needs to go
C’mon Man as Biden would say. You don’t have to bend over backwards to justify or excuse her sketchy past. Just point to Trump and say “You want more of that?!” And that oughta do it. “It is what it is” as a bigger jerk might say
I'm not even going to watch this POS because Joe Biden is not a racist. YOU are the RACIST. In fact, you were SUED for refusing to rent apartments to blacks!
I hope so cause Biden just made her the presumptive next President (if we’re lucky and the Cotton/Carlson ticket doesn’t sneak in).  She has been pushing (with Bernie and Markey) for UBI during the pandemic and has supported Medicare for All before so I do have some hope.
I mean not for nothing but Harris has signed on to a lot of Bernie’s bills. Biden seems to actually respect him.  That does give me a little hope. Also I would like Trump to not be President anymore so I’m definitely in favor of that.
Harris is fine. She’s shown she can be moved left when the occasion calls for it. I mean, it’s Biden, we could’ve done a lot worse (and I’m not overjoyed cause she’s a cop but like I said, she’s fine). Plus it’lll he fun seeing her take Pence down a peg.
My definition of a scandal: Trump invited the Taliban to America on the anniversary of 9/11!   Donald Trump’s definition of a scandal: Biden prepared some written remarks for an important historic phone call!
is a liar. No one watches pressers anymore because it's always the same old shit. LIE ABOUT #TRUMPVIRUS, BASH DEMS, LIE ABOUT ECONOMY, INSULT SOMEONE, LIE ABOUT JOBS, CALL SOMEONE NAMES, LIE ABOUT RELIEF BILL, BASH BIDEN, LIE ABOUT VACCINE, &amp; BABBLE ON &amp; ON! 🙄
god bless America go! Biden Harris.
Wait a minute didn't she accuse Joe Biden to be racist in the presidential debate? 😆🤣🤡
Biden still has a cabinet to fill. Odds are good she'll be a part of that
No KDL on LAT's Harris replacement story.
Biden learned to do this from Obama
OHHHHHHH MY GAWD!  Extra joy!!!!  Can’t wait for Biden/Harris to KICK SOME ASS!
Congratulations biden/Harris 2020
I'm just saying,  Biden read my mind and picked my first choice for VP. You're welcome
Thank god biden/Harris 2020
Yes, I have issues with Harris, particularly around FOSTA/SESTA.  Nevertheless I wholeheartedly support and endorse Biden's decision.  Period.  End of discussion.
As I commented on Facebook, whoever Biden's pick is, it's not going to be Susan Rice. Choosing her would just give the Republicans an excuse of umpteen more rounds of BENGHAAAAAZZZIIIIII!!!!
Okay, Tweetbrain, Biden has chosen his running mate. Who do you think it's going to be?  My guess is Tammy Duckworth.
First, let me be clear, I'm voting #Biden2020 no matter who his running mate is. That being said,... COME ON BIDEN! PICK HARRIS!!! #BidenHarris2020Landslide
They’re using Johnson and Grassley to keep the dirt spreading about Biden...
Voting for Trump is voting for a racist Voting for Biden is voting for a pedophile   There IS NO HUMILITY IN AMERICA
I hope the Democrats realize that too. I wish Biden was more vengeful.
I'm also sick and tired of all the Biden commercials on TV.
Hearing the news the Mayor Pete met with biden makes me think he's getting the nod for either DOD or VA. So  whats the word? Am I right? #Biden2020
Now, if BIDEN had said this Gym, Rudy, Eric, and the whole trump peanut gallery would be vomiting snarky comments all night!
From the looks of it that's Joe Biden campaign!
The POTUS, who is NOT a financial analyst, keeps insisting the entire financial system will collapse under Biden. He needs to be reminded that Obama &amp; Biden rebuilt the damaged economy left to them by a Republican president who put the country in a recession!
Rep. Matt Gaetz Likens Joe Biden's Campaign to 'Elder Abuse'
Since  decided to bring up one of the greats of comedy to bash biden, I decided to show Mr. Williams thoughts on trump. We miss you Robin Williams.
Biden's up in every swing state. Even Texas is up for grabs this year.   So yeah, I'm doing great - thanks for asking!!  #TrumpIsLosing  #TrumpHoaxedAmerica  #TrumpHasNoPlan
If someone could prove that 77 year old Joe Biden &amp; 74 year old Donald Trump were BOTH battling dementia, (but neither man dropped out of the race) I would still vote for Joe Biden
“I was about to vote for Joe Biden, but once the President started tweeting nonsense about Anthony Scaramucci, I changed my mind and now I’m gonna vote for Donald Trump,” said no voter ever
“I was about to vote for Joe Biden, but once the President started tweeting nonsense about Anthony Scaramucci, I changed my mind and now I’m gonna vote for Donald Trump,” said no voter ever
“I was about to vote for Joe Biden, but once the President started tweeting about Anthony Scaramucci, I changed my mind and now I’m gonna vote for Donald Trump,” said no voter ever
Scoop: Inside Trump's debate prep...
Yes. China would prefer Biden. So would virtually every other country - including America.   This isn't some sort of "secret."
Biden EMBODIES RACISM, PEDOPHILIA, RAPE AND CORRUPTION! HE IS JUST PLAIN GROSS!
Biden = CORRUPTION.
I think Biden is a decent guy at heart and I’d take him over any Republican not just Trump.
Yes, Weekend at Biden's will be what we get. The rad dummies will be dragging him around and continuing to prop him up. In other words, nothing will change and we'll go back to a Democrat stagnant country.
“It’s going to be an absolutely AMAZING sunrise very luxurious, just fabulous, believe me. But Joe Biden hates the sun, if we elect him he’s going to ban sunrises. Of course the fake news CNN &amp; failing New York Times won’t tell you that, it’s just another witch hunt, believe me.”
Accusing Biden of being "to the left of Bernie Sanders" was also a nice gift to the Biden campaign.
But then who will remind us of all the "concerns" we should have regarding a Biden presidency while ignoring the fact that Trump's presidency is a complete disaster?  ...oh, right. Literally dozens of other talking heads on TV.
There's no point in watching #DictatorTrump's news conferences. Nothing but lies about #TrumpVirus/testing/jobs/economy/Dems/Biden/voting, conspiracy theories, verbal attacks, self-congratulation, &amp; a smokescreen of empty promises to distract the people. S.O.S.D.D.!
Ya gotta watch this if you have any doubt that Joe Biden could be President-you’re doubts are well founded!
AAN Daily Recap: Biden Defers to Voters on Question of Mental Fitness
So, you'll blame China for YOUR negligence regarding #TrumpVirus, lie about the number of new cases &amp; deaths, paint a rosy economic picture, lie about job numbers without mentioning over 1M filed for unemployment last week, &amp; bash mail-in voting &amp; Dems &amp; Joe Biden. S.O.S.D.D.!!!
An incumbent  at 41% approval who can’t campaign on their own accomplishments is probably not going to get re-elected. Maybe it’s time for Rudy to accuse Hunter Biden of some more crimes?
Russia again? No one needs help denigrating Biden.  He does it entirely on his own.  Try looking at China instead...
So you wanna share your opinion on why Biden saying the Black vote is a monolith is a problem and differs from what you just said there sport?
The best part is Biden can’t stop saying stuff like this daily!!
Biden is NOTHING but a straight up racist, ALWAYS was, ALWAYS will be. ANY "news" entity covering for him ARE closet racists. ANY Black Americans promoting/ voting for him IS making money for THEMSELVES and does NOT care one bit to do ANYTHING for poor Black Communities. HELLO?
IANAL but still least this makes it easier for Biden’s people to challenge his name on the ballot.
Subjects Trump wants to talk about: confederate flags, NFL kneeling, water pressure, Biden hates God  Subjects Trump DOESN’T want to talk about: 160,000 deaths, 15% unemployment
is going to get his stupid arrogant ass kicked!!!
Damn the Biden ads write themselves.  Biden does not have to do anything but let the idiot speak and remind us the #GOP is allowing our country to be in ruins.
Biden bad! Hurt God! Me smart, yeah me smart. Biden bad, hurt God.  I didn't hear it but I'm paraphrasing.
Weird that the human embodiment of the Seven Deadly Sins would be so concerned about Biden's faith.
Biden could choose a concussed, rabid squirrel as a running mate and he'd be a better choice than Trump.  Why would anyone take advice from someone who can't recognize the existential threat that 4 more years of Trump poses to this country - and the world?
Biden has plenty of time. Hillary announced Tim Kaine on August 20, 2016.
Framing Hunter Biden won’t work because the US economy shrunk by 32% in the last quarter, unemployment is at 15%, and 160,000 Americans died because the incumbent President is unfit for office
These dumb allegations are getting increasingly more pathetic. Trump will soon be reduced to accusing Joe Biden’s father of murdering JFK
Ah yes, we’ve enter entered the long-awaited “Joe Biden Is Going To Ban Water” portion of the campaign
Joe Biden hates water. He’s gonna ban it.
Biden hates water. He’s gonna ban it, too.
“Biden only flushes once. He’s lazy. Wants the government to do it all for him. I flush 12 times!”
Thanks to our Electoral College, only Trump or Biden will be the next president.  So - if you're not voting for one of them - you're not really voting at all.
“Attack on Biden”
Busted! #TrumpIsLosing!
Great ad against this creepy Joe Biden supporter!
I think creepy Joe Biden will pick Susan Rice, a known liar!
Creepy Joe Biden does not know what he is talking about!
Biden’s gonna fire all the police and then Biden will use the fired police to arrest everyone who owns a Bible
An extremely credible source has called my office and told me that because Joe Biden hates God, he is planning to ban all music, bread, apples, bananas, chairs, tables, and coffee
