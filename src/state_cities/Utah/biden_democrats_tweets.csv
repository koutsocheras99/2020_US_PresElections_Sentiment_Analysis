and they are complaining about Hunter Biden?
That's not how math works. Duverger's Law is self-perpetuating, just vote for good candidates.  But even if Dr. Jorgensen doesn't win, getting her 5% of the vote to secure FEC funding is much more of a victory than electing Trump or Biden.  #VoteGoldToSaveAmerica
Getting Jorgensen to just 5% of the vote to get FEC funding will be a huge victory. That's much more important than electing Biden/Trump, two sides of the same awful coin.  And if we can get as much as 34% there's a chance to have a good President. Join up and make real change.
She's gonna be pulling Tulis Gabbard's left and right all night. Trump and Biden have awful records.
And Biden is still an awful candidate.  I'm going to take this as an endorsement for  the Libertarian candidate that your guy is too scared to debate. #LetHerSpeak
if you are an ally to those who have experienced sexual assault and still plan on voting for trump OR biden... i- i don‚Äôt care if u think writing in or voting for a third party ‚Äúis a vote for trump‚Äù u are contradicting yourself
Biden does support Trump, that's why their presidencies would be so similar.  Vote for  if you want real positive change.
I sent you video of evidence to the contrary. Trump (like the NRA) is full of platitudes but when push comes to shove they compromise. He's a New York liberal through and through.  And yes, Biden is also awful.
Straight from the donkey's mouth:   Donald Trump doesn't care about our rights. Like Biden, he gives lip service and occasional platitudes and "what about the other guy?" Vote Libertarian if you really value your rights. Dr. Jorgensen would abolish the ATF.
Why is nobody talking about the missing 11%?   is out there for everyone who wants a good candidate to vote for instead of warmongering, debt-happy, corporatist, constitution-hating Trump and Biden. This election is too important for them to be running.
"This election is too important for Trump and Biden to be running" -    Libertarians will make waves this year. Why not endorse a good candidate instead of an octogenarian warmonger who fanned the flames of mass incarceration and endless war and debt?
This election is too important for Trump and Biden to be running. Maybe they can try again in 2028 after Dr.  scales back the federal government to its constitutionally enumerated powers so who wins the Presidency can't hurt anyone so much.
Nah. We only "don't have a chance" because defeatists and shills keep saying so and don't report on our candidates or include them in polls. I'm going to use my little vote to move the Libertarian Party closer to 5%, a far greater victory than electing Trump or Biden. #VoteGold
No. Duverger's Law is a self-perpetuating historical observation, not a rule. If enough people vote for a candidate she will win.  But even if she doesn't, getting the Libertarian Party to 5% so we can have a level playing field is more of a victory than electing Biden or Trump.
Biden would probably pull an FDR knockoff and try to new deal us out of it. No thank you.
Let‚Äôs just wait and see the debates...if they are held...Biden has been in politics 50 years and has done üí©
Try to list some reasons we should remove Trump without touching federal powers enabled and supported by Biden.  The problem is how much power the Oval Office has, not who sits in it. Dr. Jorgensen would scale the federal government back to its constitutionally enumerated powers.
Getting the Libertarian Party to 5% of the vote would be a far greater victory than electing Biden or Trump.  When do we stop crawling back to our old masters and start voting for good candidates? I say now. Duverger's Law is self-perpetuating.
Getting a 3rd party to 5% would be a much more significant victory than crawling back to D or R yet again. Biden and Trump are both awful candidates, one is just awful more loudly than the other. There's a reason they're keeping Biden locked up.
GND is absolutely unsustainable economically, making it impossible to implement. Simply allowing nuclear would do far more.  When, during his vice presidency, did Biden speak up against the warmongering? Hindsight is 20/20, I want someone who can see wrongness in the moment.
* GND is awful and unrealistic * Iran deal is interventionism, no thanks * Biden claims proudly to have written Patriot Act &amp; voted for the 2001 AUMF, &amp; was VP while Obama expanded our wars- he will not scale them back * Jorgensen would remove all restrictions on voluntary unions
It's literally not. If she gets enough votes, she'll win.  But even if she doesn't win, I won't regret voting for her to help get the Libertarian Party to 5% so we can get federal funding next election. That's much more of a victory than electing Biden or Trump.
Can you step me through that math? Duverger's Law is not math, it's a historical observation. This year is like no other year in history and people are fed up.  Biden wrote and/or voted for the worst legislation we had in his tenure. He's not a good candidate. #VoteGold2020
Why would someone support Biden?
If you want Biden, then put together a better campaign in the next 4 years to contend with Jorgensen.  The buck stops with you when it comes to your vote. Don't blame others if you vote for a bad candidate, &amp; don't blame a bad candidate winning on those that didn't vote for them.
It's almost like they're from the same party as Biden ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  If you stop voting for the same 2 parties, we won't have a 2 party system.  Duverger's Law is self-perpetuating. Stop enabling the broken system and vote for real positive change.
Your opinion is wrong but I respect your right to have and share it üòâ  Dr. Jorgensen is a great candidate, or at least streets ahead of Biden or Trump.  Stop supporting the duopoly. A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump and this election is too important.  Vote for real change.
Nah, this election is too important for Biden and Trump to be running. Maybe they can try again in 2028 after Dr. Jorgensen shrinks the federal government so who wins can't hurt anyone so much.
is our only viable candidate this election.  A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump: Biden's bad legislation enabled Trump's bad presidency.
Has Biden gassed any citizens for a photo op? Is he promoting unproven Covid 19 cures for profit? If not, I don't care if the speaks in Klingon, he's got my vote.
Joe Biden, coming at you live from.... ummmm...... ahhhhhh.... you know the thing
Hydroxychloroquine is awesome, as it saved my Aunts life from the virus.  You don't hear much about that drug that is safe to take, because our President took it and they don't want lives saved and America back to normal.  They think Biden will win if America stays shut down.
Because they believe it helps Biden win the election if we are all at home and America is shut down.
We have free speech in America, until Twitter, Facebook or others censor us. They sensor us because we are in an election year.  No one wants Trump to be re-elected, that is why we are censored. If we all stay home, America is shut down, then it is there hope that Biden will win.
This is why Trump is gonna roll right over Biden like he did Clinton
Stop spreading lies   Duverger's Law is self-perpetuating. We have to vote differently if we want something different. Biden and Trump are both awful candidates.  is with us.  #VoteGoldToSaveAmerica #VoteGold2020
Trump is only 3 years younger than Biden, yet nobody says he is too old. In fact, we've only had one presidential nominee younger than 60 in the last 12 years, that being Obama.
You've touched my heart with this tweet...
I don‚Äôt want to get my hopes up just to be let down, but it‚Äôs definitely interesting timing. Could also be Biden trying to milk the VP anticipation and Warren‚Äôs powerhouse fundraising for all its worth before he announces someone else though üò¨
Democrats Meet Virtually To Approve Platform That Builds Off Of Biden-Sanders Effort
I disagree, considering that Biden did so much to help dig the hole.  We need a fiat of the people to make lasting change. We'll never get from the duopoly: RCV, campaign reform, fair debates, or anything else that will get us honest representation. They'd lose too much power.
To each their own. I think Trump and Biden fall from the same tree, but I appreciate that you've thought about all the options and you're not just voting because muh team. Take time to examine Dr. Jorgensen's platform if you haven't already:
Being "progressive" by common definition is not a goal of mine, and Biden was VP during the presidency that enabled Trump's domestic warfare. He's not a good candidate.
Because Biden is also awful :/  If enough people vote for a 3rd party candidate, she will win. And if not, she'll have gotten closer to the magic 5% needed for a more level playing field.
If there were somehow really only 2 candidates, I don't think I'd vote. Trump and Biden are both unconscionably bad options to me.  I think getting Trump out is a phyrric victory if it means we get Biden in. I'm going to use what little influence I can to push for real change.
So you want Joe Biden to steal income from people to give it to different people?
You have a lot more in common with Dr. Jorgensen than Trump or Biden. You maybe just aren't aware of her positions or you think the solutions you've heard of are the only ones.
Not at all. Biden wrote the 1994 Tough on Crime bill, and claims (falsely but proudly) to have written the Patriot Act. He's a bad candidate, and Trump is obviously awful.  I'm voting for a good candidate instead of an awful one. Care to join?
Biden wrote the Tough on Crime bill that facilitates the militarization of police, and he was VP when Obama signed the NDAA that "legalized" Trump's kidnapping raids and domestic warfare.  Biden is a bad candidate. Even if none of this is true, what has he proposed to fix things?
You definitely didn't read it then ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  She's the only candidate who supports ending qualified immunity and demilitarizing police. Biden wrote the laws that militarized them, and we've seen what Trump does with that.
Biden either wrote or voted for all of the worst legislation we had during his 40+ years in government, and sat idly as VP while Obama expanded our unconstitutional wars, built child cages, and signed the NDAA that enables Trump's domestic terrorism. He's an awful candidate.
Dr. Jorgensen is the Libertarian nominee, not a write in. She's got ballot access in enough states to win- all states if courts will stop requiring petitioning during a pandemic.  A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump. They're both awful candidates, I'm voting for a good one.
This election is too important for Biden &amp; Trump to be running. Maybe they can try again in 2028 after Dr. Jorgensen scales the federal government back to its constitutionally enumerated powers so who gets elected can't hurt anyone so much.  A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Of course I care. I also care if Biden gets 4 years. They're both awful, and Biden has had even longer in government to prove it. He wrote and voted for some awful legislation, and was VP when the NDAA was signed and the child cages were built. He's just another side of the coin.
Pathetic  called these poor mom's fake news. Disgusting.

Speak sentences? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  This election is too important for Trump and Biden to be running. Maybe they can try again in 2028, after Dr. Jorgensen scales the federal government back to its constitutionally enumerated powers so who wins the presidency can't hurt anyone so much.
Yeah we have different priorities. We're going to keep skidding downhill whether Trump or Biden is elected, so I'm going to do what I can to help the LP have the best footing in future elections if not win this one. A 3rd party is the only way we're stopping our death spiral.
A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  Removing Trump would be a phyrric victory if it means we get Biden instead. They're both horrendous candidates and neither of them is entitled to my vote. I'll be voting for real change instead, regardless of your bad math.
Beating Trump is a phyrric victory if we get demented warmonger Joe "Crime Laws" Biden in his place. The only true victory I see possible is electing Jo Jorgensen, or at least boosting the % she gets.
Step me through your reasoning for voting for Biden and I'll show you where we diverge, because I definitely am using my head.
He‚Äôs an idiot. No doubt. Probably on his way to Dementiaville. Biden is already there.
This election is too important for Biden to be running. Maybe he can try again in 2028 after we've shrunk the federal government so who gets elected can't hurt us all so much.
Oh, I see now. I misread the poll question.  Good for you, having a brain and a spine attached! Let's take as many voters from Trump and Biden as possible, maybe we can win.
Wow, another person who doesn't take the time to understand something that's initially scary. Go form a club or something.  Biden is an awful candidate and you can't convince anyone otherwise or you'd have tried.
Vote Trump/Biden if u: * Love national debt * Hate guns * Want more troops to die * Love Saudi Arabia * Hate the 6th amendment * Want the government to keep paying for abortions  Vote for Jo Jorgensen if u: * Want smaller govt * Hate the ATF * Hate police violence * Love liberty
Biden proudly wrote laws that weaponize police, and he was VP when the NDAA authorizing the suspension of 6th amendment rights of these so-called "terrorists" was signed.  Biden is also an AWFUL choice.  Now more than ever we need a 3rd party. #VoteGold for
My vote will not be contributive to Trump or Biden winning, because I would never vote for either of them. Millions of Americans feel the same way and we're sick of this crap.
Those who say it cannot be done should not stand in the way of those who are doing it.  Your naysaying helps nobody. A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump. I'll be voting for real change. Even if Dr. Jorgensen doesn't win, I'll have helped move the needle and get the LP more %.
Why? A vote for Trump is a vote for Biden.
It will if we elect Biden or reelect Trump.   is the only candidate opposed to these kinds of socialist measures.
This election is too important for Trump and Biden to be running. Maybe they can run again in 2028 after we've shrunk the federal government so who wins can't hurt anyone so much.
Very interesting map! Biden is actually winning in my ZIP code when it comes to individual donors, leading Trump 98-97! I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised ü§©
Trump does deserve credit for this, Biden does, you know, the thing.
We're talking about her right now, so yes you have heard of her ;)  Even if she doesn't win, getting 5% of the vote to secure federal funding would be more of a victory than electing Trump or Biden, so I'm going to vote for her.
Maybe a "wasted" 2 years until the congressional election. Gridlock would show people how dysfunctional Congress really is and the bully pulpit is a great spotlight.  I'd rather have gridlock than Trump or Biden though. And at least Jo would end our wars. Congress can't make war.
I think Biden's campaign approach may need to ramp up more at some point with regards to Biden's independence as a candidate, but after a presidency as traumatic as Trump's has been, people are craving nostalgia, friendship, empathy, and calm like this. I know that I am, at least
Biden can barely speak. They're both awful candidates.  is the only viable candidate who can pull us out of the death spiral we've been in for the past several elections.  #VoteGoldToSaveAmercia
is the only viable candidate who has real solutions to overpolicing. Biden has had his day (decades) in the sun, and Trump has proven he's not interested in civil rights in the slightest. This election is too important for either of them to be running. #VoteGold
These gestapo are enabled &amp; empowered by Qualified Immunity, &amp; the NDAA of Obama.  I came here because of your like &amp; noticed your Biden flair- he wrote the Tough on Crime Act that militarizes these guys. Vote Libertarian if you want peace in our time. #EndQualifiedImmunity
You realize that the many times Biden has used racial slurs will come up the closer we get to Nov. are you new to this planet?  Trump has done more for Americans than Biden has in the 50 years he‚Äôs been in govt
It is time for Donald Trump to send in the army national guard, and other federal agencies!!! Since the liberal left-wing crazy Democrat party mayor's and governors. Won't do anything to help out, the president only has one choice. A vote for Biden, is a vote thrown away.üòÇ Biden is hiding out in some basement somewhere and can barely eat pudding at this point ( a little exaggerated but not by much)
Can we just stop for a moment and appreciate the fact that we are back to arguing with morons about basketball again and not arguing about masks, or Trump, or Biden...
And Hillary Clinton &amp; Nancy Pelosi just endorsed Biden. Can any of them be trusted???
Imagine being so shitty at your job that you get fired and replaced by Joe Biden...
Watch Biden‚Äôs press conference. But you gonna say ‚Äúrigged‚Äù, right? I‚Äôm happy he ‚Äúrigs‚Äù better than this fool. Ok with that: it‚Äôs planning.... something only Putin dies in this admin.
We expect an early night, with president elect Biden taking a victory lap.
Wait, are you insinuating that poor people are minorities? Is that a Freudian slip like when Biden said ‚Äúpoor kids are just as bright as white kids‚Äù?
Isn't it time members of both parties and all persuasions stop shouting "Attack" when institutional racism is called out?
It‚Äôs so jive to know that once Biden takes office he is going to just snap his fingers and presto...all things COVID will be solved! Go Joe!

I was reading an article this morning that was making Biden‚Äôs choice seem more like ‚ÄúSophie‚Äôs Choice‚Äù.
ü§îü§îü§î just wondering when Biden ran the country? What did he do??
I‚Äôm so sorry ladies. I‚Äôm voting Biden. This gop vet has had enough of this bigoted dictator.
Maybe not about debates in general, but saying that this particular debate is pointless because something about Trump being an unfair or incompetent debater or something lol my prediction is that Biden ends up doing the debates, but if he wins, he won‚Äôt last four years
That's my point. He's not a great candidate but I'm voting for him because we cannot afford 4 more years of the moron in office right now. Biden just can't be worse.
If you vote for Joe Biden, then you're really not that smart.
DO YOU PATRIOTS REALIZE THAT IN ORDER FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP TO SECURE THE PRES IN NOV THAT HE MUST PARDON JULIAN ASSAINGE? JULIAN HAS ALL THE DOCS (ALONG WITH MAXWELL) TO TAKE DOWN THE KABAL! IF NOT, BIDEN MAY WIN! üò© THINK ABOUT IT. TRUMP IS MAKING A MISTAKE HERE. RAISE UR VOICE!!
I just donated again to Biden.  #gop4biden
Biden bragged about actually taking out a corrupt player after allies agreed was so. Trump threatened and delayed congress approved funds illegally to manufacture evidence for his benefit. ???
Here are some reason why Joe Biden should not be president: 1. The Economy will crash 2. Constant riots 3. Open boarders  4. There will be no police 5. He is just a bad person with Pelosi in general   do you agree?
What Ivanka is saying is true, Lisa.  Biden was wrong then and wrong now.  And being critical of her as a mother is inappropriate.
Biden does not have to brag about passing the test.   It‚Äôs only given if there is a  suspected mental issue.  Apparently even trumps doctors were concerned.
I think she is a lot like Joe Biden lost in space.It always shows "this tweet is unavailable." Did Joe Biden block you????
Why did you stop the audio.  Had you continued: Stern: Did you want to bang her? Trump: Well, at 12, I wasn‚Äôt interested. I‚Äôve never been into that. They‚Äôve sort of always stuck around that 25 (years old) category. There's more but out of words...
The election between Hillary and Trump and Biden and Trump is one of the stupidest things I‚Äôve ever seen.
Don't worry they will certainly also be shocked and upset when Ex President Trump will comment and attack on president Joe Biden or whoever lead the nation. FOR SURE, right?
Hard to blame him. It‚Äôs hard to be motivated to go out &amp; vote when voting is what got us Trump vs Hillary in 2016. &amp; Trump vs Biden 2020. Of course voting is important, I don‚Äôt disagree with that. But I don‚Äôt blame anyone one bit for not being motivated to vote for politicians.
I hope they at least let Joe Biden pick the design, after all.
Sorry but it is an indication of what's going on. And the numbers as predicted are horrible. Sorry this is all in the lap of the failed presidency and the failed Republican party. It is only going to get worse from here. Elect somebody that knows what they're doing vote Biden.
Where does Biden has to go to get his apology from you?
Trump gets things done. He has held true to most of his promises and I'd like to see what more he can accomplish. Biden is nothing more than a mouthpiece for the left's agenda. If he wins, I don't think it will be him running the show, it will be all of the extreme liberals.
Sounds like  owes Joe Biden an apology.
Trump better have his bags packed by Inauguration Day.   Biden‚Äôs White House doesn‚Äôt have an ‚Äúextended checkout time‚Äù
Biden would have been a 90‚Äôs Republican
Joe Biden needs to go and announce his VIP pick so we can vote for her already
Biden ought to commit to establishing a task force to energetically undo every one of Trump's executive actions that can be reversed.
Let a Trump run your company, but I‚Äôll vote Biden to run the country.
Still not going to vote for Biden.
And I'll unmute others when they stop trying to convince me that Joe Biden is the savior.   BTW, our tomato plants are fucking amazing.
I can't believe you did an AD for Joe Biden. . . What a turncoat you are.  Guess that means your are not going to pursue justice on your committee either.  Hope you lose your election.
1) please check the thread where I said Biden was as bad/worse than Trump. I objected to calling Trump a Literal Fascist, on analytical grounds. You have to understand your enemy to defeat it, and you don‚Äôt.   2) see above. again, you‚Äôre making a LOT of personal assumptions
then when biden loses you and the other deranged freaks can blame us for not showing up
I had wanted Warren to be President the whole time.  I voted for her in the primary.  There's no question I'm going to cast my vote for Biden.   What is this nonsense?
I really believe trump will steal this election. Barr is certainly willing to help him do that. I don‚Äôt see Biden doing anything at the moment to combat it either. In fact I don‚Äôt see Democrats doing anything! I am a lifelong Dem and am very concerned.
I heard he reads the most books. Only the best books. People say he's the best reader they've ever seen. So fast. Much faster than Biden.
I‚Äôm not arguing that Republicans are fiscally-conservative, they just pretend to be.  Biden: $2T Infrastructure plan Medicare public option $1.7T Climate plan  Need I go on? This would be a historic increase on already insane levels of spending.
So he has dementia. So do all of those that Biden will run the country and not Soros
Yes, on November 3rd remember what huge liars Donald Trump and his kids are, and how ignorant they are about what constitutes freedom of speech. Vote Joe Biden! #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica

Dan Bongino .. I want to watch and support A G Barr.. but now because the stations SEE this kangaroo court now we‚Äôre being forced to try and stomach Biden ... .. I‚Äôve changed over to another channel
I will also add this, you not voting isn‚Äôt sending a message to the DNC or the RNC. Rubio and Jeb had their chances in 2016. Voters picked Trump. Same with Biden. You‚Äôre anger should be directed at the voters, not the parties.
There‚Äôs two implications with that stand:  1. That you believe Biden would be just as bad as Trump. Do you really believe that?  2. That implicitly you are okay with Trump getting a second term. Do you really believe that?
I do full heartedly! I had other picks in mind , Bernie, kamala, Elizabeth Warren. I would vote for Biden happily if it means the dirty, organized crime, orange ball sack will no longer be able to destroy our country any further. I love Obama so I hope Joe has The same styleü§©

Darren why don‚Äôt you go down in the basement with Biden where you‚Äôre safe and let the rest of us live our lives!
I‚Äôm not saying she‚Äôs great but I‚Äôd rather it be her than Bass, Rice, or Warren. Duckworth could be better. Remember, I‚Äôm just playing the game of picking from a pool of bad options. I‚Äôm not voting for Biden but I‚Äôd still like him to choose the least bad option. Pick your poison.
My Dem family members who probably represent where the average Biden voter is at would rather have someone like her who they feel has a handle on things and can take charge. The criminal justice stuff isn‚Äôt the biggest issue and I think most people will just forgive and forget.
Nope. Biden has the Foreign policy chops, he needs a VP that can focus more on domestic issues. Also, Rice would force him to relitigate Benghazi, etc. Also, Bass has too much far left baggage in her past to be good pick. Duckworth or Harris should be the top picks imo.
Wouldn't you just love to hear Joe Biden try to pronounce this!?
That's okay, President Biden will pardon them all and then RIP down those offensive statues.
They missed a great chance to take the pressure off their candidate.  It would have been so easy to bury M4A in the platform.  Now Biden is going to be asked about all the time.

No, he got impeached because the Liberals are panicking. He is exposing their corruption. What we SAW and HEARD Biden do was actual ‚Äúdirty game‚Äù. But, you see what you want to see - meaning you too are corrupt. There you go.

Obama/BIDEN had 7 years to replace the masks. Why didn't they? Trump has replaced the masks where Obama/Biden didn't. See the difference?
I‚Äôve never lived in a time where the top candidates didn‚Äôt debate each other on a national platform. we have yet to see Trump debate Biden. Hmmm I wonder why that is... ü§î
Obama/Biden left a 100 million mask deficit in the strategic national stockpile, according to the LATimes. Trump more than replaced them and got enough ventilators in record time. Was the LATimes lying?
This guy told me today the country is going to fall apart if Biden is elected.  I don‚Äôt think they realize how stupid they sound.i wonder how joe biden is celebrating national orgasm day

Biden wasn't my choice in the primary but dear God he is so much better than Trump and since our election system is broken Biden is the only one with a chance at successfully beating Trump.
its dead in the water regardless. joe "green by 2070" biden with his oil exec donors? dont make me fucking laugh. the only way joe is going left is if he does a 180 first.

Vote for Biden.

If John Lewis got arrested 44 times fighting for my right to vote.  If John Lewis was willing to die for my right to vote.  The least I can do to honor his legacy is to take my chances, wear PPEs, have a hand sanitizer and wait in line as long as it to VOTE for Joe Biden.
Probably will be once Biden gets in office
Notre dame backed out so who knows if someone else will pick it up. But biden is trying very hard to get them canceled. I don't blame him. I didnt vote for cox and am not a fan of him lately so I agree with you.
YEP and by canceling debates and by hiding Biden from the world not letting him talk. It's all being manipulated big time
Biden and the DNC are trying to manipulate the whole race on the other hand.  You don't have an issue with that?
"Biden...said, ‚ÄúMark my words, I think he is going to try to kick back the election somehow, and come up with some rationale why it cannot be held.‚Äù It is just the type of thing that a crazed guy in a tightly buttoned raincoat whispers to you on the subway." -
Even after the election if Biden wins he wont take office till January 20th, I'm sure it apples there aswell.

This convinces me that you know NOTHING about what‚Äôs at stake in Nov. You think liberals have your best interests at heart? Progressives, so called, are nothing but communists who don‚Äôt have the guts to come out of the closet. Joe Biden is unfit to serve that will be clear soon.

You just laid out the best argument yet for why Joe Biden must never be elected.
Mail in ballots start about 3 weeks before election Day here. They have to be received before midnight election Day.  It's simple really. The voter is responsible for having the vote in on time. tRump is arguing that people will steal ballots from his supporters and vote Biden.
a vote for biden is a vote for whoever the electoral college chooses, so instead of voting for president you could just pool your money with your friends and buy a monster truck and smash other cars with it
even Democrats know Biden will ruin this country

Trump better play nice to Biden.   If Trump and his Goya beans loving family are found guilty of bank fraud, insurance fraud, and tax evasion, they may need to beg Biden for a pardon or get ready to serve time in prison.  This the MAIN for having mercenaries killing Americans now
That was tRump. Biden laid out his plans to bring back jobs. Starting with government contractors.  Said he has a plan to create business opportunities for POC unlocking the doors that block them.  What conference were you watching? He laid it all out.
It means that the centrists Biden was picked to win over wont vote, which makes the race dangerously close for a president who has flirted repeatedly with the idea that he wouldn't he accept the results of the election
They‚Äôd make a good pair. Biden enjoys grooming girls and Harris enjoys having older men chart the path of her career.
like joe biden will make it easier for 3rd parties LMAO
why yes 1% good is a bazillion times better than 1/(bazillion)th of 1% good but... compared to even 10% good they are both miniscule. joe "nothing will fundamentally change" biden is a fucking waste of 4 years in every single sense of the word.
Pelosi will take office, and then we will have an election and I dont have to waste a vote on biden, and choose someone else. üòÄ

If you really want me to. Picking hillary the is how this country "earned" trump. Many bernie supporters I know are now voting trump because biden offers nothing. About 25%. Myself not included, but maybe open your eyes a little. Yang gang should be smarter than this, come on.
even if that were my job i cannot see a clear decision. the only way joe biden can guaranteed get my vote is if nina turner is the vice president.
give us bernie and trump will be out ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ i know many people who were going to vote bernie but are now voting trump because joe biden fucking blows ass
i do my part by not blindly following the party names. joe biden doesnt want my vote. i can tell because he has done nothing to earn it.
Joe Biden when he gets asked to do an interview:
Clearly, they were speaking of Biden's brain. His brain has not been available for many years.
Everyone knows the Biden campaign is lying. He's available. He's just afraid to face unfriendly questions. Biden is hiden'.
Not surprised in the slightest. An improvised conversation would be a death sentence for Biden's campaign. There is no way his campaign will allow Biden to be on a debate stage with Trump if it is not precisely controlled.
I don't know all the rules about airtime for elections, but isn't there something that says stations have to give equal time to all candidates, so if Kanye is a candidate, if a station airs an episode of Kardashians he's in do they have to give free air time to Biden and Trump?

He won't. The dems claim he is corrupt, a russian asset, a racist, and a dictator among other things. No proof. They claim Biden is noble, honest, and trustworthy. No proof. Dems want mail voting to create a contested election hoping they can win by hook and crook. VOTE TRUMP2020

Joe Biden needs to pick who Joe Biden thinks will best serve as his VP. Not who you want. Not who I want. Who he wants. For all we know he and Warren can't stand the sight of each other. It is his choice. His alone. And we can suck it up and act like voting adults or we can't.

The election between Hillary and Trump and Biden and Trump is one of the stupidest things I‚Äôve ever seen.
Don't worry they will certainly also be shocked and upset when Ex President Trump will comment and attack on president Joe Biden or whoever lead the nation. FOR SURE, right?
Hard to blame him. It‚Äôs hard to be motivated to go out &amp; vote when voting is what got us Trump vs Hillary in 2016. &amp; Trump vs Biden 2020. Of course voting is important, I don‚Äôt disagree with that. But I don‚Äôt blame anyone one bit for not being motivated to vote for politicians.
I hope they at least let Joe Biden pick the design, after all.
Where does Biden has to go to get his apology from you?
Trump gets things done. He has held true to most of his promises and I'd like to see what more he can accomplish. Biden is nothing more than a mouthpiece for the left's agenda. If he wins, I don't think it will be him running the show, it will be all of the extreme liberals.
Sounds like  owes Joe Biden an apology.

I can't believe you did an AD for Joe Biden. . . What a turncoat you are.  Guess that means your are not going to pursue justice on your committee either.  Hope you lose your election.
1) please check the thread where I said Biden was as bad/worse than Trump. I objected to calling Trump a Literal Fascist, on analytical grounds. You have to understand your enemy to defeat it, and you don‚Äôt.   2) see above. again, you‚Äôre making a LOT of personal assumptions
then when biden loses you and the other deranged freaks can blame us for not showing up
I really believe trump will steal this election. Barr is certainly willing to help him do that. I don‚Äôt see Biden doing anything at the moment to combat it either. In fact I don‚Äôt see Democrats doing anything! I am a lifelong Dem and am very concerned.
I heard he reads the most books. Only the best books. People say he's the best reader they've ever seen. So fast. Much faster than Biden.
I‚Äôm not arguing that Republicans are fiscally-conservative, they just pretend to be.  Biden: $2T Infrastructure plan Medicare public option $1.7T Climate plan  Need I go on? This would be a historic increase on already insane levels of spending.
So he has dementia. So do all of those that Biden will run the country and not Soros
You made the right choice. I trust Vice President Biden to choose his best possible running mate whoever she might be.
So I just read in Twitter that there are people stating if Elizabeth Warren is not on the ticket they might not vote for Biden. What? Are these people fucking 12 years old or are they simply friends of Sarandon? Grow up you damned idiots!
Yes, on November 3rd remember what huge liars Donald Trump and his kids are, and how ignorant they are about what constitutes freedom of speech. Vote Joe Biden! #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
I will also add this, you not voting isn‚Äôt sending a message to the DNC or the RNC. Rubio and Jeb had their chances in 2016. Voters picked Trump. Same with Biden. You‚Äôre anger should be directed at the voters, not the parties.
There‚Äôs two implications with that stand:  1. That you believe Biden would be just as bad as Trump. Do you really believe that?  2. That implicitly you are okay with Trump getting a second term. Do you really believe that?
I support whoever he chooses. My faith in Vice President Biden has always been unwavering.
They want the #shamdemic to continue,  destroying the economy to help Biden. They want to push a vaccine on us ...

That's okay, President Biden will pardon them all and then RIP down those offensive statues.
They missed a great chance to take the pressure off their candidate.  It would have been so easy to bury M4A in the platform.  Now Biden is going to be asked about all the time.

How can it be a vote for Trump when the Right says it is a vote for Biden?  Or maybe nobody owns your damn vote but you, and it goes directly and ONLY to who you vote for.  This faulty logic is why we continue to have a two-party duopoly working in kahoots for their donors

I see where you‚Äôre coming from. That‚Äôs why I think we need to eliminate the electoral college. However, Kanye has historically leaned right and showed support for trump. That said, I think a trump supporter could just as reasonably say a vote for Kanye is a vote for Biden.
Yes and no. Because of the electoral college, our individual votes don‚Äôt actually count as an individual vote for the candidate.   The biggest demo that K would draw votes from is the black vote, which overwhelmingly supports Biden, so it would increase the ratio in favor of T.

Mr. Biden, it would help if you were elected first, before you make plans.  Wait on the tweeting.

I‚Äôm so afraid of Trump, Vice President Biden. I‚Äôm afraid he‚Äôll try to disrupt &amp; void the election, that he‚Äôll declare martial law, that he‚Äôll send troops into American cities to subdue the populace. I‚Äôm afraid he‚Äôll incite violence &amp; force us to take to the streets. I‚Äôm so afraid
100% Mom for Biden.  A Trump lackey speaking for parents is a bad joke - not one is fit to raise a child any more than 45 was.
Listen, you live in an abstract bubble DETACHED from reality. Obama is a war criminal, Biden is a war criminal. What are you, a utopian communist? You can't be serious, not in this chaotic world?
What about joe Biden‚Äôs family?  üñïüèºMatt.
i think he would try and negotiate no prosecution somehow, and biden camp would not push prosecution either, they're too afraid of rocking the economic boat. the coming usd collapse is more critical to these evil folks deeds not being exposed
Yes I will vote and it will be for  Biden!
So the Joe Biden has Dementia approach isn't working? Shocker
What's more important...correct and fair elections where everyone in our country has an equal chance to vote or a big party on election day. It's not like Biden will start the job on Nov 3rd. He will take office on January 20th.
But you won‚Äôt condemn the violence by the Biden voters in Portland. What is wrong with you Ben?
It wasn‚Äôt a serious idea. He said it with a question mark. Libs are so gullible. Now if Biden suggests it all the MSM, Dems and Romney RINO‚Äôs will jump on board.
He and Biden are having the same mental breakdown
now you're just Dem-splaining, the way you win wars, is no mercy, you send messages, you go on the attack. GOP knows Democrats are weak and ineffective, and they choose a centrist Joe Biden, who's old and not all there. I will vote for him in self defense, but we are not winning
Sorry but it is an indication of what's going on. And the numbers as predicted are horrible. Sorry this is all in the lap of the failed presidency and the failed Republican party. It is only going to get worse from here. Elect somebody that knows what they're doing vote Biden.
Romney is an idiot. Moving more troops into Poland and two aircraft carriers into the South China Sea is not helping Russia or China. But pompous Romney says nothing about Biden‚Äôs proposed defunding of the military.

Biden should select Gretchen Whitmer.
Biden selecting Kamala will drive down the black vote. Her record as a prosecutor is too much baggage. So far Trump cannot attack Biden but he can lay in wait to attack his VP and use her negative to bring down Biden's positives. Cant take that risk.
You have an acute case of Trump Derangement Syndrome. Please get help. I suppose you believe Biden will stand up to China? üòÜ
I think if Biden stays quiet and does nothing that Trump can attack for the next 97 days, Trump will do himself in. Trump's campaign is built on creating fear, panic and attacking others which his loyal base loves. The rest of us are just watching him implode.
You have to admit, Harris made it difficult to pick her as VP by trying to paint Biden as a racist.
People will be shook when Biden picks Tulsi Gabbard as VP!
We love segregation, don‚Äôt we folks? Biden sucks, but we gotta get this racist piece of trash outta the White House.

Biden: I've been in Washington for 50 years, vote for me and I will fix everything I screwed up over my career. I don't think so. Nice try.
Pretty sure Biden wouldn‚Äôt call China out like that even if other countries around the world are doing the same. Plus they just blocked TrumpJr from twitter for retweeing ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù about Covid so it‚Äôs not like you can believe anything they say.
Biden doesn‚Äôt say anything wrong there. It was all very rational and correct.
Biden: People who loot and destroy property should prosecuted Twitter: FASCIST
Also if Biden wins they‚Äôre getting to 50. The senate candidates are running ahead of him by a few points

Don‚Äôt recall the Tribune ever discussing Hunter Biden‚Äôs payoffs from China or Ukraine. The Tribune is a corrupt news organization.
Your tweet is not making much sense other than you are posting an anti-Biden article. Can't you tell the difference between real news and fake? Your article is propaganda, nothing more. Make an educated choice, don't listen to fools.

January 20th 2021 at noon Eastern time Joe Biden will be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. He won't be number 46. Because work anywhere race the 45th president from our history.
I dunno. Defund the police is not a winning message, which is why Biden‚Äôs not embraced it. The focus doesn‚Äôt seem to be on blm anymore  The campaign ads write themselves....fallen statues, panicked drivers surrounded by attacking mobs, this will play well in Dubuque as they say
I can't wait to vote for Biden and remove, #trumplethinskin.
Don't worry if you forgot because looking at Biden's politics, I'm sure he just took our spots.
One thing that's clear, Joe Biden will pick a black woman. As to whom that is, its yet to be seen. As long as it's not Nina "bowl of shit" Turner I'm good.
Life is so much easier being an unconditional and actual Biden supporter. I am not as invested in the VP race as some are who make their support for Biden conditional on who he picks for VP
She's not from a swing state. All she is , is a black woman that looks good on tv and was a prosecutor. I don't understand the upheaval and threat against supporting Biden if he doesn't pick her. You can't claim to support a black woman as VP when you make it conditional on said
At the end of the day, Biden will make the choice on who his VP will be. Not Chris Dodd and not the Khive. People overreacting because it might not be Kamala need to explain what she has actually done or contributed to get the spot. She didn't help Biden will California, he lost
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
The good news is that if Biden wins in a landslide, Trump is finished. Yeah, he can salt the earth &amp; act out his authoritarian demagoguery until January, but he‚Äôs toast. If it‚Äôs close, we have to pour out into the streets &amp; peacefully resist like hell.
Trump‚Äôs piecemeal, ad hoc, anti-science approach has devastated public health &amp; the economy. A Biden presidency ensures a competent national COVID response &amp; an equitable distribution of vaccine. #TrumpVirus

Not it isn't. Ever since the primary virtually ended nothing has kept people fired up like controversy over his VP pick. It keeps people focused and invested. Biden knows what he's doing.
I can promise you, Biden is not petty or vindictive. He's been doing this long enough not to take things personal

So what you're saying is that Trump opposes the will of the people? That's why we're electing Biden.
147,000 Americans have died from your hoax. I'll take my chance with Biden.
Was a life long Republican but voted for  because I couldn't stomach Trump. Kept waiting for the GOP to stand for our values and stand up to Trump. Finally understood that the GOP left me. I will be voting for Biden.
Which means Biden is a great politician
Corn pop, ice cream, my hairy legs, you know the thing! Incompetent!!!!

Me thinks someone besides Joe Biden is brain dead here. I would hope, unless it is during an active crisis, the president would be asleep at 3am.
Who wants to see Biden have trump arrested for not leaving office when his term is over?  I mean, it will be an ugly, ugly thing for this country if it comes to that, but a part of me really wants to see trump led out of the White House in handcuffs to stand trial from treason.
You made fun of Biden for wearing a mask. Now that you understand the importance of wearing one, you should apologize.

That‚Äôs literally Biden‚Äôs greatest selling point. Are Republicans really missing the COVID, civil unrest, economic devastation apocalypse?
Maybe Biden needs a voter registration physician to blow into his nostrils, or stroke the hairs on his leg, or, well, you know the thing
It's about time you apologize to Joe Biden for making fun of his mask
You will beat Biden off?
How can this be Biden's America when he isn't President? Trump is losing because the attacks against Biden aren't coherent?
Exactly. Trump is trying to delegitimize the election. Even if Biden wins, Trump can do so much damage before the inauguration.

Joe Biden is not polarizing.Trump wouldve had an easier time campaigning against Bernie&amp; even Obama because people get riled up by them &amp; he can feed on those emotional upheavals to fuck with people.Nobody looks at Biden and believes he's a threat to their way of life in any way
The reason Trump is having such a hard time going against Biden is because Biden is a very boring candidate. The very reason people think Biden will get his ass kicked by Trump is the very reason Biden is winning
There's zero validity in what this bootlicker is saying but I'm sure glad Biden doesn't have any of this baggage
Trump is salting the earth for Biden.  Destroying as much as he spitefully can to leave the U.S. in shambles. We can‚Äôt wait until the election. Congress must intervene NOW.
Kamala, I am so sad that you won't be our president in November, but I hold on hope that the Biden/Harris ticket will win out.
He didn't endorse Biden and tell after  It was clear that he was gonna get the nomination. That was the right thing to do I know you don't understand that because you are only about yourself. Oh unaided do a terrible job they fixed the economy look at yours it's in the toilet.
That's why I hope Trump wins. He'll accelerate the collapse. Joe Biden will only prolong the inevitable and he's just as bad as Trump in practice so he'll only serve to do the same damage but keep the people complacent
This is insane bro. Please vote this man out. Please. I know yall don't like Biden like that but just pretend he's the offspring of  MLK and Malcolm X and go vote. PLEASE!
I don't think Biden is going to pick Kamala Harris. I think the Khive need to be prepared for that possibility.
Under Biden though this will be allot more rampant and everywhere. Imo.
And they will support him and promote him unlike the breakfast club who would rather destroy Biden than support him. Trumps says alot of dumbshit but right leaning millennial platforms defend Trump. Left leaning platforms shit on Biden. Mental illness. FUCK
The economy isn't going to recover by then. COVID may at best stabilize. Schools aren't going to be fully open. All the Biden attacks have been fizzles.   What's left? Trying to provoke riots and massacres and hoping those help Trump, even though they have hurt him so far?
Even if you take 5 points off the lead for a likely voter screen, which is extremely aggressive, these still show a Biden + 8 race nationally.
You can say "Biden is barely hitting 50%!" and "This is not a likely voter poll!" as much as you want.  This still looks like a Biden + 10 race nationally. That's called a landslide.
Biden is probably not up by 13 in Florida right now, but he is very likely leading by at least high single digits.
I have been wondering if the slight reduction in Biden's margin in the national polling average over the past few days is a real change or driven by the recent polls being online and not live.  These live results do not suggest any tightening of the race.

Not only is there a chance, however small, they ascend to the office through death, I really don't want another major primary in four years. I'd soon have Biden clean this mess up and hand the keys over to a Veep who wants to win in 2024.
In some peoples' view, it might not be a bad thing for Biden to pick a VP who has no desire to be President and basically stays on message and does the President's bidding. I actually disagree. It's why I am wary of Bass. I want a VP who is okay with being president.
Trump's dementia has gotten so bad he thinks his name is Joe Biden.
Joe Biden will be president! #SeduceMeIn5Words #Biden2020Landslide
Maybe but I think people are getting caught up in a false narrative. The fact we KNOW Biden is going to pick a woman no matter what means this discussion is going to revolve around women. But there's plenty of this stuff that flies when it's mostly male VP candidates as well.

Well, it appears I was wrong. Shokin was ousted for failing to pursue corruption cases, probably not exclusive of Burisma.

But just in April you thought Biden was 'way over the line' when he said he believed Trump would want to delay the election? Do you ever post 'mea culpas' or just move on and not acknowledge?
I live in DEEP BLUE Massachusetts, and literally have not seen a single Joe Biden sign. I drive the highway every day and have seen 3 Biden bumper stickers going from central Mass down through CT and back.
Biden has not picked Harris. She is merey one on his list of women being vetted. Please dont add unnecessarily to the already over the top rumor mill!
Has the vaccine been proven safe? Or real? Can we trust Bill Gates with our life? Biden might have a point.
Oooops....this aged really well. Guess Biden was right about this too.
It wasn‚Äôt a serious idea. He said it with a question mark. Libs are so gullible. Now if Biden suggests it all the MSM, Dems and Romney RINO‚Äôs will jump on board.

#VoteBiden.  Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
I'm a Sanders Supporter at heart. I know the disappointment of watching Biden win the nomination in a walk. I've also seen progressives winning primaries and given the current trends, they are likely to win seats where we need them. If they win, they can compel Biden to action.
He has 1st amendment rights just like everyone else does. Just because it didn‚Äôt say Mr Potato ü•î head Biden , they had no right to shoot him. Sometimes Mr Pres.  may tweet some things we don‚Äôt like but it has nothing to do with the job he has done as POTUS. We shouldn‚Äôt forget
Saw someone say "Settle for Joe Biden‚ÄîHe Won't Pepper Spray Your Mom" and I would just like to sit in the glow of the brainworms it took to compose such a message
I try to avoid making predictions and keep my mind open. Yes, Biden has not been friendly to #M4A, but we'd be better off not relying upon him anyway. Best to work on electing progressives in both houses so that Biden has to negotiate with them, for he can only sign what passes.

Sorry but it is an indication of what's going on. And the numbers as predicted are horrible. Sorry this is all in the lap of the failed presidency and the failed Republican party. It is only going to get worse from here. Elect somebody that knows what they're doing vote Biden.
Romney is an idiot. Moving more troops into Poland and two aircraft carriers into the South China Sea is not helping Russia or China. But pompous Romney says nothing about Biden‚Äôs proposed defunding of the military.
Let me clarify then. Trump is an egotistical, pervert tyrant. Biden is a senile, pedo tyrant. I will vote for neither. Anyone who suggests any alteration to free elections is a tyrant and should be treated as such. Bring out the tar and feathers.
This entire thread of Republicans clutching their pearls about Biden‚Äôs suggestion in April that Trump May seek to delay the election is just PEAK phony outrage

When does Biden get his apologies
Since we‚Äôre talking about Biden accusations that we‚Äôre criticized but turned out to be true:
Trump, in West Texas, warns Biden is threat to oil and gas industry. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just Texas oil that the radical Democrats want to destroy, they want to destroy our country. These people are sick. They are sick." Psychologists call that PROJECTION!
Biden can see through this....He will make the right choice.
What we know now about religious voters and the #2020election
This thread is wild. Lots of folks owe Biden an apology.  Trump's call to delay the election and suggest an election is fraudulent months before it happens is one of the greatest attacks to our democracy we've seen in modern times. Really scary stuff.
Biden didn‚Äôt say that.  His leftest handlers did.  Biden‚Äôs a shell, a toady for the leftists that can‚Äôt win elections.

A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn‚Äôt pretty - The Boston Globe
Short and simple.  The Biden's manage to sell F35 to China.  They attempted to launder the money in Ukraine.  Ukrainian officials robbed them and disappeared into Russia.  The Biden's then embezzled US taxpayer funds in the form of aid to Ukraine.
Trump is narcissistic, lacks compassion and lies for sport. Biden doesn‚Äôt know what year it is. Your bias is showing.
This was one of the reasons why Joe Biden had to threaten Ukraine with 1 billion dollars of financial aid.  Because the Biden family was trying to recoup some of the lost 1.5 billion.  248 million dollars was allocated to an offshore drilling rig.
What the Biden's did not expect was corrupt Ukrainian officials disappearing with that 1.5 billion and a lot of financial aid from the United States into Russia.   It's not a conspiracy theory..  I will continue
Timeframe.  The middle of 2014. The Biden's needed to find a place to launder the money.  No one would ever consider laundering money in a country that is just emerging from A-war with Russia.
All we need to do is let the shit show in the White House keep tweeting shit like this and the election is in the bag for Biden.  #FuckTrump

Why would they try to stop her from becoming VP? She‚Äôs everything I would want! If she were not great, she wouldn‚Äôt be on Biden‚Äôs shortlist.
Let's start with Hunter biden's trip on Air Force 2 with Joe Biden to China at the end of 2013.  That was when Hunter Biden received 1.5 billion from China.  It has been said that the money was for Chinese investment purposes.  The reality is much darker.
And I know precisely why Hunter Biden got 1.5 billion from China.   And what happened to the money.
The stuff that I have researched. Would make most people start shaking uncontrollably.  Including how China acquired an F35 lightning 2 joint strike fighter.   Most people are not aware that George Soros was a majority shareholder in Burisma holdings while Hunter Biden was there.

Analysis: Do religious voters like Trump or Biden best?

Not only would it not be said of a man, it's completely backwards for the current circumstances. Joe Biden will not run again in 2024, so if he's not picking a VP that is ready to be President in 2024, he's doing it wrong.

Do Joe Biden's allies not understand that if we win v Trump, minting a ready-to-run Democrat for 24 or 28 is...not a bad thing at all and what most of the party wants right now?
How's that effort to question Joe Biden's mental acuity going?
I've sought to create a reasonable all-woman cabinet that Biden might actually pick, not the one I would pick, because I'm not the democratic nominee for president. If you don't want to engage in that discussion, you don't have to, but don't lecture me on what "we" should want.
Cool. Biden is likely to pick one or more Republicans for his cabinet. (Obama had several.) Who is better qualified?
Should Biden be attacked for being too ambitious a VP, seeing that he had his eye on the presidency? It's sexist nonsense.
why don't they give Biden more of the brain drug from Limitless that they used when he debated Bernie, I don't get it. is there a limited supply or is that what makes Joe's eyes bleed
If you don‚Äôt support Trump that‚Äôs fine, it‚Äôs your choice. To everybody voting or supporting Biden you are mentally unfit to make a logical decision because nobody in their right mind could watch his gaffs and then turn around and say he would make a great president! #Trump2020
You think a cabinet position is a private reward, rather than a public service? Cute. That's how President Trump thinks, too. Kuster is a Democrat. Biden will likely choose at least one, of not multiple GOPers to be on his cabinet. If he does, who do you want to be there?
I'm not voting for Joe Biden, and I am a Yank. Don't like it, Dems? Do the work to eliminate the Electoral College and first past the post so my vote actually counts in the PotUS races.

Biden and puppets and AOC and socialism, oh my. What will they think of next. Are you tired of the existing conversation on the table then
On the bright side, if Biden wins, we'll have our first woman president.  The bad news is it will be Kamala Harris (w/ all due respect).

I get that, but at this point in time, it is between trump and Biden.
In short: Even if the D's do take over the world in Nov, I predict that the U.S. will go in the same direction that Washington State has gone under Governor  (who might be Biden‚Äôs EPA pick but I doubt it): lots of talk but not much action. 11/
I don‚Äôt think Biden is a bad guy (does anyone?) but climate action is hard, politics is the art of the possible, and the greens have made it too easy for him to pick other priorities.  And they've continued to ignored this 2014 advice from Democratic strategist  8/
The appeal of "SIJJ" is that Biden can avoid making hard choices that will antagonize energy consumers and organized labor swing voters and can instead focus on more popular issues (like universal pre-K?) while still getting kudos from the greens for making the right noises. 7/
Jobs: Take Biden at his word: ‚ÄúWhen I think about climate change, the word I think of is ‚Äòjobs.‚Äô‚Äù This strongly suggests that he will move slowly on actions that threaten existing fossil fuel jobs (especially union jobs). 5/
Symbolism: Biden will back the Paris Accord, set targets of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, etc. This is easy and painless and feel-good, but remember that the Clean Water Act had a goal of eliminating water pollution by 1985. 3/
David Roberts  has written about the left coalescing around "SIJ": Standards, Investment, and Justice. But to a large extent what I think we‚Äôre going to get is "SIJJ": Symbolism, Infrastructure, Jobs, and Jurisprudence. 2/
For the record, here‚Äôs what I think is going to happen on the climate front under a President Biden. This is not necessarily what I _want_ to happen, it‚Äôs what I think is _going_ to happen, and it‚Äôs why I‚Äôm focusing on state-level efforts. (See end of thread to join!) 1/
Biden's treatment of Anita Hill helped give us Clarence Thomas. If you're going to hard pass at people who have helped put women's rights at risk, you're going to need to reckon with that fact.
You're entitled to that take, but it is almost certainly not Biden's take, and wholesale rejection of any group has never gone well for any society. Forgive and forget? Heck no. But redemptive paths are crucial to socio-cultural growth.

I'll be fine if, on election day, Biden is up by an average of 5+ and undecideds/third party vote doesn't make up 10+% like in 2016.  Currently, the average for the latter is 8.2%, which is high but not so high it evaporates Biden's advantage.
If Biden is so fucking electable, why are the libs freaking out that the left aren't supporting him?  Get to phone banking.
That's fine. Biden's very likely to pick at least one, if not several, cross-political cabinet members. (Obama had three from the start and four overall.) Choose a Republican who you like better, and we'll give her a call. üôÇ
Also, listen to Joe Biden interviews from like 1995. He sounds exactly the same. He just says weird things sometimes. It‚Äôs basically his brand.

Obviously, one of these people is likely to be Biden's veep pick. That's not a problem. This list of qualified people for every one of these cabinet positions is, as Sen. Mitt Romney might put it, "binders full of women" deep.
In myriad ways, this would be the most diverse cabinet in U.S. history, and it would include a few Republicans (Biden encouraged President Obama to include GOP voices on the cabinet; he'll want bipartisan representation on his cabinet, too.)
If he wins, Joe Biden would need ZERO men for his cabinet. (thread)
I get it. They make great ads, but they‚Äôre a bunch of grifters. They created the environment that allowed for Trump and are now capitalizing on the mess. If Biden wins, they can fuck right off

He‚Äôs setting stage for states like Pennsylvania and Michigan that have mail in votes to contest them. If close those states easy to see vote cast Election Day Trump but mail in ballots tip to Biden. Trump will claim fraud, republicans legislators back him and big mess.
Vote for Biden.
Biden means HOPE.
If John Lewis got arrested 44 times fighting for my right to vote.  If John Lewis was willing to die for my right to vote.  The least I can do to honor his legacy is to take my chances, wear PPEs, have a hand sanitizer and wait in line as long as it to VOTE for Joe Biden.
Probably will be once Biden gets in office
Notre dame backed out so who knows if someone else will pick it up. But biden is trying very hard to get them canceled. I don't blame him. I didnt vote for cox and am not a fan of him lately so I agree with you.
YEP and by canceling debates and by hiding Biden from the world not letting him talk. It's all being manipulated big time
Biden and the DNC are trying to manipulate the whole race on the other hand.  You don't have an issue with that?
"Biden...said, ‚ÄúMark my words, I think he is going to try to kick back the election somehow, and come up with some rationale why it cannot be held.‚Äù It is just the type of thing that a crazed guy in a tightly buttoned raincoat whispers to you on the subway." -
Even after the election if Biden wins he wont take office till January 20th, I'm sure it apples there aswell.
Not much good news for tRump.  Biden vs. Trump 2020: Live Updates
But still Trump gets removed from office, that's all good for me. And when they have the election I could vote for someone besides Biden.
If trump does removed via this, the Republicans dont have a second candidate they'll have to scramble for one. So it will be Biden vs whoever's running.

This convinces me that you know NOTHING about what‚Äôs at stake in Nov. You think liberals have your best interests at heart? Progressives, so called, are nothing but communists who don‚Äôt have the guts to come out of the closet. Joe Biden is unfit to serve that will be clear soon.

You just laid out the best argument yet for why Joe Biden must never be elected.
Mail in ballots start about 3 weeks before election Day here. They have to be received before midnight election Day.  It's simple really. The voter is responsible for having the vote in on time. tRump is arguing that people will steal ballots from his supporters and vote Biden.
a vote for biden is a vote for whoever the electoral college chooses, so instead of voting for president you could just pool your money with your friends and buy a monster truck and smash other cars with it
even Democrats know Biden will ruin this country

Trump better play nice to Biden.   If Trump and his Goya beans loving family are found guilty of bank fraud, insurance fraud, and tax evasion, they may need to beg Biden for a pardon or get ready to serve time in prison.  This the MAIN for having mercenaries killing Americans now
The most corrupt President was the OBAMA/BIDEN admin &amp; there is proof! Your bloviating is DEM talking points but not facts!  More divisiveness from the LYING DEMOCRATS &amp; the failed Presidential candidate! Yes, the one who lied about her many failings!
That was tRump. Biden laid out his plans to bring back jobs. Starting with government contractors.  Said he has a plan to create business opportunities for POC unlocking the doors that block them.  What conference were you watching? He laid it all out.
It means that the centrists Biden was picked to win over wont vote, which makes the race dangerously close for a president who has flirted repeatedly with the idea that he wouldn't he accept the results of the election
They‚Äôd make a good pair. Biden enjoys grooming girls and Harris enjoys having older men chart the path of her career.
like joe biden will make it easier for 3rd parties LMAO
why yes 1% good is a bazillion times better than 1/(bazillion)th of 1% good but... compared to even 10% good they are both miniscule. joe "nothing will fundamentally change" biden is a fucking waste of 4 years in every single sense of the word.
Pelosi will take office, and then we will have an election and I dont have to waste a vote on biden, and choose someone else. üòÄ
the real world consequences? we still are the world police. poor are dtill poor and aca fees INCREASE. biden promised his donors time and time again that nothing will fundamentally change. eat a fucking asparagus bro

If you really want me to. Picking hillary the is how this country "earned" trump. Many bernie supporters I know are now voting trump because biden offers nothing. About 25%. Myself not included, but maybe open your eyes a little. Yang gang should be smarter than this, come on.
even if that were my job i cannot see a clear decision. the only way joe biden can guaranteed get my vote is if nina turner is the vice president.
give us bernie and trump will be out ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ i know many people who were going to vote bernie but are now voting trump because joe biden fucking blows ass
i do my part by not blindly following the party names. joe biden doesnt want my vote. i can tell because he has done nothing to earn it.
Joe Biden when he gets asked to do an interview:
Clearly, they were speaking of Biden's brain. His brain has not been available for many years.
Everyone knows the Biden campaign is lying. He's available. He's just afraid to face unfriendly questions. Biden is hiden'.
If  wins, it is proof DEMOCRATS rigged the election! If DEMOCRATS elect Biden, it proofs how incompetent DEMOCRATS are &amp; that BIDEN won't be running America, it will be the lobbyists &amp; Clintons, BHO! DON'T VOTE DEMOCRAT!
THIS IS GOING TO BACKFIRE ON DEMOCRATS!  This will backfire on Biden!  Note everyone: DEMS have not said or condemned once on the rioting, looting, shootings &amp; murders!  ALL the DEMS have done is support the rioting! DEMS are funding the rioting!  FOLLOW THE MONEY!
GET NOTHING DONE? All American's need to look back at the 8 yrs of misery we suffered thru b/c BHO &amp;  were in the WH. Worst economy in history! American's worked 2, 3 &amp; 4 jobs b/c of the failed policies of BHO &amp; Biden!  American's don't want those years again!

Joe Biden needs to pick who Joe Biden thinks will best serve as his VP. Not who you want. Not who I want. Who he wants. For all we know he and Warren can't stand the sight of each other. It is his choice. His alone. And we can suck it up and act like voting adults or we can't.
#JoeBidenJob Wow, are all these Biden fans bots?  Or just in denial about the last election?  Biden is the same idiot that wrote "gun free" legislation that made school kids defenseless targets.

as incompetent as his wife!  America's neighborhoods were devastated by the Obama/Biden admin. You can't push that blame out to the   Can't name 1 thing Obama/Biden did for America's neighborhoods! They did more for Iran than for America!
They are not worried about Americans. They are not worried about America! They worried about POWER, GREED &amp; SELF!  The have become so corrupt &amp; will do, say or destroy anything or anyone to get power! BHO, Biden &amp; Clinton were the most corrupt admin the USA has seen!
Are you serious? This is happening RIGHT NOW in TRUMP's AMERICA- the GOP AMERICA. You can't blame President Obama for this and you can't blame Joe Biden. Only  THE FAILED PRESIDENT, his corrupt administration and GOP congressional enablers are to blame! #hadenough
Biden Panders to Muslims: Quotes Muhammad, Says Schools Should Teach IslamIt always shows "this tweet is unavailable." Did Joe Biden block you????
Why did you stop the audio.  Had you continued: Stern: Did you want to bang her? Trump: Well, at 12, I wasn‚Äôt interested. I‚Äôve never been into that. They‚Äôve sort of always stuck around that 25 (years old) category. There's more but out of words...
Don't worry they will certainly also be shocked and upset when Ex President Trump will comment and attack on president Joe Biden or whoever lead the nation. FOR SURE, right?
I hope they at least let Joe Biden pick the design, after all.
Where does Biden has to go to get his apology from you?
Trump gets things done. He has held true to most of his promises and I'd like to see what more he can accomplish. Biden is nothing more than a mouthpiece for the left's agenda. If he wins, I don't think it will be him running the show, it will be all of the extreme liberals.

And I'll unmute others when they stop trying to convince me that Joe Biden is the savior.   BTW, our tomato plants are fucking amazing.
I can't believe you did an AD for Joe Biden. . . What a turncoat you are.  Guess that means your are not going to pursue justice on your committee either.  Hope you lose your election.
I heard he reads the most books. Only the best books. People say he's the best reader they've ever seen. So fast. Much faster than Biden.
I‚Äôm not arguing that Republicans are fiscally-conservative, they just pretend to be.  Biden: $2T Infrastructure plan Medicare public option $1.7T Climate plan  Need I go on? This would be a historic increase on already insane levels of spending.
So he has dementia. So do all of those that Biden will run the country and not Soros
Yes, on November 3rd remember what huge liars Donald Trump and his kids are, and how ignorant they are about what constitutes freedom of speech. Vote Joe Biden! #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
I will also add this, you not voting isn‚Äôt sending a message to the DNC or the RNC. Rubio and Jeb had their chances in 2016. Voters picked Trump. Same with Biden. You‚Äôre anger should be directed at the voters, not the parties.
There‚Äôs two implications with that stand:  1. That you believe Biden would be just as bad as Trump. Do you really believe that?  2. That implicitly you are okay with Trump getting a second term. Do you really believe that?
They want the #shamdemic to continue,  destroying the economy to help Biden. They want to push a vaccine on us ...
Darren why don‚Äôt you go down in the basement with Biden where you‚Äôre safe and let the rest of us live our lives!
Wouldn't you just love to hear Joe Biden try to pronounce this!?
That's okay, President Biden will pardon them all and then RIP down those offensive statues.
They missed a great chance to take the pressure off their candidate.  It would have been so easy to bury M4A in the platform.  Now Biden is going to be asked about all the time.

No question that Biden is being used as a Trojan Horse, to deliver what they really want in that position.
Amen. Choosing to vote for any person or party no matter what is delegating your morality. Principles over party, always. üôè  (I'm personally still voting for Joe Biden, but I do so begrudgingly)

Yes, because it‚Äôs every American woman‚Äôs dream to be a suburban housewife. And of course they need a man to ‚Äúmake it better‚Äù. Listen to AOC and vote Biden -
People resist "Socialism" when clearly that's what would save the country. They call Bernie Sanders all kinds of names; but he was the exact candidate to put this country back together. Good luck with Biden, if you can get him.
Exactly, Biden wins the American experiment is over
AOC wait until Joe Biden points a finger at you .
Name one thing Joe Biden has done for any Americans .And Biden said "if you don't vote for me, you ain't black" ... but he gets a pass right?
I would also like to know why you are targeting Biden when Trump just gave 685 billion for F-35 in a global pandemic and how many people unemployed and going hungry.  Your priorities are so skewed!  WTH dude????
Seriously fight Biden AFTER Trump is out of the White House!  Not before.  Prioritization is key here
So you would vote for Trump before Biden?  You are a socialist supporter and you would vote Red and not Blue?  Well there is an oxymoron.

Not cool. I‚Äôm very open about my deal breakers: No racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, Obama or Hillary haters, or anyone who is not going to vote for Biden. Trump hating is allowed. I proudly voted for Hillary, and I‚Äôd do it again.
As long as they vote for Biden, that's all that matters right now...We MUST vote Rump out of office.
I had a dream last night that Biden chose  as his running mate. I‚Äôm cool with that. He really has some great women to choose from. He should be announcing that soon, right?
I‚Äôm not going to argue with you. At least 40-50 women have accused Trump of rape and/or sexual assault. How many have accused Biden? Not to mention Trump was best buds with a known pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Sorry that your president is going to lose in November.
Remember how you used to apply those tough on crime laws Biden voted for? Good fucking times.
Look at it this way, Biden is at an advanced age. My thoughts are whoever the VP is may end up the big winner... that‚Äôs the platform that is going to matter. If he goes with a progressive... that would be sweet! There is a pretty big opportunity here.

This is a great idea to establish a truth commission with a bipartisan task force if Biden wins the election. There have been way too many questionable actions by the Trump administration that need to be uncovered and prosecuted if necessary.

I'll bite. In what way does Biden not display a reasonable degree of competence, character, and commitment to the Constitution? What's your biggest concern here?
Mueler report showed nothing. Waste of our money. Wanna talk about withholding aid? Joe Biden is caught on camera bragging about that same thing they proved trump innocent of.
Seeing the Democratic Party has done everything they can to take Trump down I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll come up with another plan to rig the election. For instance Biden wanting everyone to mail in their ballot to vote. Trump wants it to be fair as do I!

He won't. The dems claim he is corrupt, a russian asset, a racist, and a dictator among other things. No proof. They claim Biden is noble, honest, and trustworthy. No proof. Dems want mail voting to create a contested election hoping they can win by hook and crook. VOTE TRUMP2020

It wasn‚Äôt a serious idea. He said it with a question mark. Libs are so gullible. Now if Biden suggests it all the MSM, Dems and Romney RINO‚Äôs will jump on board.
He and Biden are having the same mental breakdown
Sorry but it is an indication of what's going on. And the numbers as predicted are horrible. Sorry this is all in the lap of the failed presidency and the failed Republican party. It is only going to get worse from here. Elect somebody that knows what they're doing vote Biden.

Pretty sure Biden wouldn‚Äôt call China out like that even if other countries around the world are doing the same. Plus they just blocked TrumpJr from twitter for retweeing ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù about Covid so it‚Äôs not like you can believe anything they say.

I‚Äôm not saying she‚Äôs great but I‚Äôd rather it be her than Bass, Rice, or Warren. Duckworth could be better. Remember, I‚Äôm just playing the game of picking from a pool of bad options. I‚Äôm not voting for Biden but I‚Äôd still like him to choose the least bad option. Pick your poison.
My Dem family members who probably represent where the average Biden voter is at would rather have someone like her who they feel has a handle on things and can take charge. The criminal justice stuff isn‚Äôt the biggest issue and I think most people will just forgive and forget.
I dunno. Defund the police is not a winning message, which is why Biden‚Äôs not embraced it. The focus doesn‚Äôt seem to be on blm anymore  The campaign ads write themselves....fallen statues, panicked drivers surrounded by attacking mobs, this will play well in Dubuque as they say
Nope. Biden has the Foreign policy chops, he needs a VP that can focus more on domestic issues. Also, Rice would force him to relitigate Benghazi, etc. Also, Bass has too much far left baggage in her past to be good pick. Duckworth or Harris should be the top picks imo.
I can't wait to vote for Biden and remove, #trumplethinskin.
Don't worry if you forgot because looking at Biden's politics, I'm sure he just took our spots.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
The good news is that if Biden wins in a landslide, Trump is finished. Yeah, he can salt the earth &amp; act out his authoritarian demagoguery until January, but he‚Äôs toast. If it‚Äôs close, we have to pour out into the streets &amp; peacefully resist like hell.
Trump‚Äôs piecemeal, ad hoc, anti-science approach has devastated public health &amp; the economy. A Biden presidency ensures a competent national COVID response &amp; an equitable distribution of vaccine. #TrumpVirus

I would rather vote for my dead dog than vote for Biden. My dead dog is smarter.
My roots run deep in Texas. Everyone in my extended family is voting for Biden. Because he is a good man.
Everyone I know in and from PA is voting for Biden. Trump is a miserable failure.
So what you're saying is that Trump opposes the will of the people? That's why we're electing Biden.
147,000 Americans have died from your hoax. I'll take my chance with Biden.
Was a life long Republican but voted for  because I couldn't stomach Trump. Kept waiting for the GOP to stand for our values and stand up to Trump. Finally understood that the GOP left me. I will be voting for Biden.
Corn pop, ice cream, my hairy legs, you know the thing! Incompetent!!!!
Me thinks someone besides Joe Biden is brain dead here. I would hope, unless it is during an active crisis, the president would be asleep at 3am.
Who wants to see Biden have trump arrested for not leaving office when his term is over?  I mean, it will be an ugly, ugly thing for this country if it comes to that, but a part of me really wants to see trump led out of the White House in handcuffs to stand trial from treason.
You made fun of Biden for wearing a mask. Now that you understand the importance of wearing one, you should apologize.
Sealed; Biden's senate voting record.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
The middle class has been coming along fine under the Trump administration.  Biden's taxes and environmental policy will knock it for a loop though.

JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE. DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
That‚Äôs literally Biden‚Äôs greatest selling point. Are Republicans really missing the COVID, civil unrest, economic devastation apocalypse?
Maybe Biden needs a voter registration physician to blow into his nostrils, or stroke the hairs on his leg, or, well, you know the thing
It's about time you apologize to Joe Biden for making fun of his mask
Donald Jr. looks like a total doofus on Fox News. He does not understand as to why Joe Biden &amp; Barack Obama can have a sit down discussion as to the stupidity of Lit‚Äôl Don‚Äôs dad. Only thing that is missing is coffee. Maybe Lit‚Äôl Don should take a cognitive test himself. So Sad!!

Exactly. Trump is trying to delegitimize the election. Even if Biden wins, Trump can do so much damage before the inauguration.
You mean someone who has the ability to take the country backwards like you did! I guess you served your purpose though token! You‚Äôre a lunatic if you think Biden is going to take us anywhere! When are you going to go away

He didn't endorse Biden and tell after  It was clear that he was gonna get the nomination. That was the right thing to do I know you don't understand that because you are only about yourself. Oh unaided do a terrible job they fixed the economy look at yours it's in the toilet.
Under Biden though this will be allot more rampant and everywhere. Imo.
The economy isn't going to recover by then. COVID may at best stabilize. Schools aren't going to be fully open. All the Biden attacks have been fizzles.   What's left? Trying to provoke riots and massacres and hoping those help Trump, even though they have hurt him so far?
Even if you take 5 points off the lead for a likely voter screen, which is extremely aggressive, these still show a Biden + 8 race nationally.
You can say "Biden is barely hitting 50%!" and "This is not a likely voter poll!" as much as you want.  This still looks like a Biden + 10 race nationally. That's called a landslide.
Biden is probably not up by 13 in Florida right now, but he is very likely leading by at least high single digits.
I have been wondering if the slight reduction in Biden's margin in the national polling average over the past few days is a real change or driven by the recent polls being online and not live.  These live results do not suggest any tightening of the race.

Don't worry they will certainly also be shocked and upset when Ex President Trump will comment and attack on president Joe Biden or whoever lead the nation. FOR SURE, right?
Yes I will vote and it will be for  Biden!
What's more important...correct and fair elections where everyone in our country has an equal chance to vote or a big party on election day. It's not like Biden will start the job on Nov 3rd. He will take office on January 20th.
I hope they at least let Joe Biden pick the design, after all.
But you won‚Äôt condemn the violence by the Biden voters in Portland. What is wrong with you Ben?
It wasn‚Äôt a serious idea. He said it with a question mark. Libs are so gullible. Now if Biden suggests it all the MSM, Dems and Romney RINO‚Äôs will jump on board.
He and Biden are having the same mental breakdown
Sorry but it is an indication of what's going on. And the numbers as predicted are horrible. Sorry this is all in the lap of the failed presidency and the failed Republican party. It is only going to get worse from here. Elect somebody that knows what they're doing vote Biden.
Romney is an idiot. Moving more troops into Poland and two aircraft carriers into the South China Sea is not helping Russia or China. But pompous Romney says nothing about Biden‚Äôs proposed defunding of the military.
Where does Biden has to go to get his apology from you?
Trump gets things done. He has held true to most of his promises and I'd like to see what more he can accomplish. Biden is nothing more than a mouthpiece for the left's agenda. If he wins, I don't think it will be him running the show, it will be all of the extreme liberals.

I can't believe you did an AD for Joe Biden. . . What a turncoat you are.  Guess that means your are not going to pursue justice on your committee either.  Hope you lose your election.
I think if Biden stays quiet and does nothing that Trump can attack for the next 97 days, Trump will do himself in. Trump's campaign is built on creating fear, panic and attacking others which his loyal base loves. The rest of us are just watching him implode.
We love segregation, don‚Äôt we folks? Biden sucks, but we gotta get this racist piece of trash outta the White House.
Are you aware that thousands of republicans are voting for Biden come November 3rd? Or do you still have the blinders on, ensuring you only see what you want? üôÑüôÑüôÑ
1) please check the thread where I said Biden was as bad/worse than Trump. I objected to calling Trump a Literal Fascist, on analytical grounds. You have to understand your enemy to defeat it, and you don‚Äôt.   2) see above. again, you‚Äôre making a LOT of personal assumptions
then when biden loses you and the other deranged freaks can blame us for not showing up

Biden: I've been in Washington for 50 years, vote for me and I will fix everything I screwed up over my career. I don't think so. Nice try.
I heard he reads the most books. Only the best books. People say he's the best reader they've ever seen. So fast. Much faster than Biden.
I‚Äôm not arguing that Republicans are fiscally-conservative, they just pretend to be.  Biden: $2T Infrastructure plan Medicare public option $1.7T Climate plan  Need I go on? This would be a historic increase on already insane levels of spending.
Pretty sure Biden wouldn‚Äôt call China out like that even if other countries around the world are doing the same. Plus they just blocked TrumpJr from twitter for retweeing ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù about Covid so it‚Äôs not like you can believe anything they say.
So he has dementia. So do all of those that Biden will run the country and not Soros
Biden doesn‚Äôt say anything wrong there. It was all very rational and correct.
Yes, on November 3rd remember what huge liars Donald Trump and his kids are, and how ignorant they are about what constitutes freedom of speech. Vote Joe Biden! #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
Also if Biden wins they‚Äôre getting to 50. The senate candidates are running ahead of him by a few points
Can‚Äôt watch it now..Biden has taken over because it‚Äôs so blatantly obvious what the libs agenda was doing .. typical lib thinking
Only you can read, right? Biden loves to sniff women and children. Go near him, I‚Äôm sure you will love the attention.

Dan Bongino .. I want to watch and support A G Barr.. but now because the stations SEE this kangaroo court now we‚Äôre being forced to try and stomach Biden ... .. I‚Äôve changed over to another channel
I will also add this, you not voting isn‚Äôt sending a message to the DNC or the RNC. Rubio and Jeb had their chances in 2016. Voters picked Trump. Same with Biden. You‚Äôre anger should be directed at the voters, not the parties.
There‚Äôs two implications with that stand:  1. That you believe Biden would be just as bad as Trump. Do you really believe that?  2. That implicitly you are okay with Trump getting a second term. Do you really believe that?
I do full heartedly! I had other picks in mind , Bernie, kamala, Elizabeth Warren. I would vote for Biden happily if it means the dirty, organized crime, orange ball sack will no longer be able to destroy our country any further. I love Obama so I hope Joe has The same styleü§©

Not only is there a chance, however small, they ascend to the office through death, I really don't want another major primary in four years. I'd soon have Biden clean this mess up and hand the keys over to a Veep who wants to win in 2024.
In some peoples' view, it might not be a bad thing for Biden to pick a VP who has no desire to be President and basically stays on message and does the President's bidding. I actually disagree. It's why I am wary of Bass. I want a VP who is okay with being president.

Maybe but I think people are getting caught up in a false narrative. The fact we KNOW Biden is going to pick a woman no matter what means this discussion is going to revolve around women. But there's plenty of this stuff that flies when it's mostly male VP candidates as well.
April 24, 2020: "The Trump campaign issued a statement Friday, saying, "Those are the incoherent, conspiracy theory ramblings of a lost candidate who is out of touch with reality."

The thing is that Bernie and Biden ARE on the same page. Bernie has just lost control of his delegates because it was never about him for them apparently.
Well, it appears I was wrong. Shokin was ousted for failing to pursue corruption cases, probably not exclusive of Burisma.
The article I shared noted that the prosecutor that was fired was hindering an investigation into Burisma. Why would Biden do that? Why would he seek to have a prosecutor fired when the guy was "helping" Biden?

Joe Biden embraces children. It makes them nervous. While he holds them, he sniffs them. Then he makes inappropriate comments to them. This is a long-term consistent behavior. Save them some trauma. Don‚Äôt let your children near Joe Biden.
Joe Biden said he‚Äôd do everything Trump did, usually long after Trump had already done it. Joe Biden is a cynical, pathetic liar.
No, he got impeached because the Liberals are panicking. He is exposing their corruption. What we SAW and HEARD Biden do was actual ‚Äúdirty game‚Äù. But, you see what you want to see - meaning you too are corrupt. There you go.

What's more important...correct and fair elections where everyone in our country has an equal chance to vote or a big party on election day. It's not like Biden will start the job on Nov 3rd. He will take office on January 20th.
Who do you think Biden‚Äôs pick for VP is going to be?
Based on the polls we probably should delay the election. Cancel, even. And just replace Trump with Biden sooner than later.

The way the headline was phrased made me misread it that the co-founder would ditch Biden's inauguration.

I'm a Sanders Supporter at heart. I know the disappointment of watching Biden win the nomination in a walk. I've also seen progressives winning primaries and given the current trends, they are likely to win seats where we need them. If they win, they can compel Biden to action.
He has 1st amendment rights just like everyone else does. Just because it didn‚Äôt say Mr Potato ü•î head Biden , they had no right to shoot him. Sometimes Mr Pres.  may tweet some things we don‚Äôt like but it has nothing to do with the job he has done as POTUS. We shouldn‚Äôt forget
Saw someone say "Settle for Joe Biden‚ÄîHe Won't Pepper Spray Your Mom" and I would just like to sit in the glow of the brainworms it took to compose such a message
I try to avoid making predictions and keep my mind open. Yes, Biden has not been friendly to #M4A, but we'd be better off not relying upon him anyway. Best to work on electing progressives in both houses so that Biden has to negotiate with them, for he can only sign what passes.
now you're just Dem-splaining, the way you win wars, is no mercy, you send messages, you go on the attack. GOP knows Democrats are weak and ineffective, and they choose a centrist Joe Biden, who's old and not all there. I will vote for him in self defense, but we are not winning

Short and simple.  The Biden's manage to sell F35 to China.  They attempted to launder the money in Ukraine.  Ukrainian officials robbed them and disappeared into Russia.  The Biden's then embezzled US taxpayer funds in the form of aid to Ukraine.
Trump is narcissistic, lacks compassion and lies for sport. Biden doesn‚Äôt know what year it is. Your bias is showing.
This was one of the reasons why Joe Biden had to threaten Ukraine with 1 billion dollars of financial aid.  Because the Biden family was trying to recoup some of the lost 1.5 billion.  248 million dollars was allocated to an offshore drilling rig.
What the Biden's did not expect was corrupt Ukrainian officials disappearing with that 1.5 billion and a lot of financial aid from the United States into Russia.   It's not a conspiracy theory..  I will continue
Timeframe.  The middle of 2014. The Biden's needed to find a place to launder the money.  No one would ever consider laundering money in a country that is just emerging from A-war with Russia.
All we need to do is let the shit show in the White House keep tweeting shit like this and the election is in the bag for Biden.  #FuckTrump

Let's start with Hunter biden's trip on Air Force 2 with Joe Biden to China at the end of 2013.  That was when Hunter Biden received 1.5 billion from China.  It has been said that the money was for Chinese investment purposes.  The reality is much darker.
And I know precisely why Hunter Biden got 1.5 billion from China.   And what happened to the money.
The stuff that I have researched. Would make most people start shaking uncontrollably.  Including how China acquired an F35 lightning 2 joint strike fighter.   Most people are not aware that George Soros was a majority shareholder in Burisma holdings while Hunter Biden was there.

Biden selecting Kamala will drive down the black vote. Her record as a prosecutor is too much baggage. So far Trump cannot attack Biden but he can lay in wait to attack his VP and use her negative to bring down Biden's positives. Cant take that risk.

Cool. Biden is likely to pick one or more Republicans for his cabinet. (Obama had several.) Who is better qualified?
Should Biden be attacked for being too ambitious a VP, seeing that he had his eye on the presidency? It's sexist nonsense.
why don't they give Biden more of the brain drug from Limitless that they used when he debated Bernie, I don't get it. is there a limited supply or is that what makes Joe's eyes bleed

You think a cabinet position is a private reward, rather than a public service? Cute. That's how President Trump thinks, too. Kuster is a Democrat. Biden will likely choose at least one, of not multiple GOPers to be on his cabinet. If he does, who do you want to be there?

You have to admit, Harris made it difficult to pick her as VP by trying to paint Biden as a racist.
People will be shook when Biden picks Tulsi Gabbard as VP!
Biden and puppets and AOC and socialism, oh my. What will they think of next. Are you tired of the existing conversation on the table then
On the bright side, if Biden wins, we'll have our first woman president.  The bad news is it will be Kamala Harris (w/ all due respect).
if thats your sole reasoning for voting for Biden then you should have your voting rights taken away.
We love segregation, don‚Äôt we folks? Biden sucks, but we gotta get this racist piece of trash outta the White House.

All these program were cut as well We will remember on Nov 3
I get that, but at this point in time, it is between trump and Biden.
In short: Even if the D's do take over the world in Nov, I predict that the U.S. will go in the same direction that Washington State has gone under Governor  (who might be Biden‚Äôs EPA pick but I doubt it): lots of talk but not much action. 11/
I don‚Äôt think Biden is a bad guy (does anyone?) but climate action is hard, politics is the art of the possible, and the greens have made it too easy for him to pick other priorities.  And they've continued to ignored this 2014 advice from Democratic strategist  8/
The appeal of "SIJJ" is that Biden can avoid making hard choices that will antagonize energy consumers and organized labor swing voters and can instead focus on more popular issues (like universal pre-K?) while still getting kudos from the greens for making the right noises. 7/
Jobs: Take Biden at his word: ‚ÄúWhen I think about climate change, the word I think of is ‚Äòjobs.‚Äô‚Äù This strongly suggests that he will move slowly on actions that threaten existing fossil fuel jobs (especially union jobs). 5/
Symbolism: Biden will back the Paris Accord, set targets of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, etc. This is easy and painless and feel-good, but remember that the Clean Water Act had a goal of eliminating water pollution by 1985. 3/
David Roberts  has written about the left coalescing around "SIJ": Standards, Investment, and Justice. But to a large extent what I think we‚Äôre going to get is "SIJJ": Symbolism, Infrastructure, Jobs, and Jurisprudence. 2/
For the record, here‚Äôs what I think is going to happen on the climate front under a President Biden. This is not necessarily what I _want_ to happen, it‚Äôs what I think is _going_ to happen, and it‚Äôs why I‚Äôm focusing on state-level efforts. (See end of thread to join!) 1/
Biden's treatment of Anita Hill helped give us Clarence Thomas. If you're going to hard pass at people who have helped put women's rights at risk, you're going to need to reckon with that fact.
You're entitled to that take, but it is almost certainly not Biden's take, and wholesale rejection of any group has never gone well for any society. Forgive and forget? Heck no. But redemptive paths are crucial to socio-cultural growth.

I'll be fine if, on election day, Biden is up by an average of 5+ and undecideds/third party vote doesn't make up 10+% like in 2016.  Currently, the average for the latter is 8.2%, which is high but not so high it evaporates Biden's advantage.
If Biden is so fucking electable, why are the libs freaking out that the left aren't supporting him?  Get to phone banking.
That's fine. Biden's very likely to pick at least one, if not several, cross-political cabinet members. (Obama had three from the start and four overall.) Choose a Republican who you like better, and we'll give her a call. üôÇ
Also, listen to Joe Biden interviews from like 1995. He sounds exactly the same. He just says weird things sometimes. It‚Äôs basically his brand.
I think you mispelled Biden...it's TRUMP.  This is happening under TRUMP. Are you so incompetent that you don't even know who is President right now? Wow!

This isn't a thought experiment. If Biden wins, this should happen.
Obviously, one of these people is likely to be Biden's veep pick. That's not a problem. This list of qualified people for every one of these cabinet positions is, as Sen. Mitt Romney might put it, "binders full of women" deep.
In myriad ways, this would be the most diverse cabinet in U.S. history, and it would include a few Republicans (Biden encouraged President Obama to include GOP voices on the cabinet; he'll want bipartisan representation on his cabinet, too.)
If he wins, Joe Biden would need ZERO men for his cabinet. (thread)
I get it. They make great ads, but they‚Äôre a bunch of grifters. They created the environment that allowed for Trump and are now capitalizing on the mess. If Biden wins, they can fuck right off

There's a Mandela Effect surrounding the 2016 election. The polls weren't wrong. They had Clinton up by ~3% and she won the pop vote by 2%, which is well within the MOE.  It's the EC that screwed everything up. Biden is up by 10 points. That margin can't be swung by the EC.

Would love to see law profs (Tribe, Turley) ask Biden and Trump questions abt the Bill of Rights. Doubt Trump has ever read them or could name any but the 2nd, awesome memory notwithstanding.
So you want who to be your president? Ideally? Because if you can't find somebody to support between Warren and Sanders and Harris and Biden....you may not believe in the political ideologies you claim to.
It‚Äôs called being awake and the Clinton‚Äôs are criminals and Pete and Amy were PAID to drop out right before Super Tuesday and they were probably promised cabinet positions for endorsing Biden and it‚Äôs better to know the sad truth than play happy pretend.
The establishment really spent all day smearing Rashida Tliab and Nina Turner and accused them of not supporting Biden, they‚Äôre really that pathetic and that‚Äôs how you know that they‚Äôre scared.

If Trump were to magically come around... They think he'd outflank Democrats? They don't think Biden would be like 'same'? Because I'm pretty sure he would.
No doubt I don't know anyone supporting Biden that is lacking in passion. We are all so fed up with   and his "family" of criminals, we're practically bursting out of our skin.
I get what you are saying... That Dodd guy is saying KH should be more apologetic due to what happened in the primaries, He‚Äôs the LAST person to be saying anything especially for all the allegations against him! Actually Biden should do something about this, It doesn‚Äôt look good!
Well a lot of politicians lie. I suspect she did to get elected! Now they‚Äôre seeing what they got. Just like the Obama administration. He lied to get elected and became a coward along with Mr. Potato Head Biden! How we survived 8 years, I don‚Äôt know

Since the start even before she dropped out I thought Biden/Harris was a winning ticket and a possible 12 year White House run. Of late I‚Äôm just not sure that person might just be Susan Rice.
While a Biden administration won‚Äôt get any greater proportion of foreign policy issues right than Trump, they will do it on purpose, which I guess counts for something? ...maybe?

Life is so much easier being an unconditional and actual Biden supporter. I am not as invested in the VP race as some are who make their support for Biden conditional on who he picks for VP
She's not from a swing state. All she is , is a black woman that looks good on tv and was a prosecutor. I don't understand the upheaval and threat against supporting Biden if he doesn't pick her. You can't claim to support a black woman as VP when you make it conditional on said
At the end of the day, Biden will make the choice on who his VP will be. Not Chris Dodd and not the Khive. People overreacting because it might not be Kamala need to explain what she has actually done or contributed to get the spot. She didn't help Biden will California, he lost

You said there were airports in the Revolutionary War. I‚Äôll vote for Biden. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020 #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica
Biden is merely a puppet. Siri‚Äôs and his gang are those that will run the country
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS LYING TO YOU AGAIN.   #TrumpLies
Remember this!
YOU are the cancer, Schiff. Biden actually got a Ukrainian prosecuted fired, bragged on camera. What about that?
It's about time you apologize to Joe Biden for making fun of his mask
‚ÄúI know firsthand how hard it can be to take care of an aging family member. It's why as president, I'll ease the financial burden on families and expand access to dignified care for older Americans.‚Äù - Joe Biden‚Äôs Tweet Writer
Arguably Warren dealt a death blow to the Bernie Sanders campaign, Biden ought to be grateful.
While Utah is not all Mormon, you can still get an feel of where the support or lack of support is from this poll. Trump is losing the youth vote and women vote (check out
No question that Biden is being used as a Trojan Horse, to deliver what they really want in that position.
You mean someone who has the ability to take the country backwards like you did! I guess you served your purpose though token! You‚Äôre a lunatic if you think Biden is going to take us anywhere! When are you going to go away
Amen. Choosing to vote for any person or party no matter what is delegating your morality. Principles over party, always. üôè  (I'm personally still voting for Joe Biden, but I do so begrudgingly)
You would think a responsible person would check to see if it‚Äôs true before they tweeted it out. There is a pattern of this administration passing along questionable info that they should be able to verify. Vote Biden for responsible government. #VoteBiden
Obama SLIPS Reveals The Plan For A Joe Biden Presidency | Huckabee's Bre...  via
Wow, Dopey Junior has some üî•üî•üî•üî• Takes about what‚Äôs been canceled and what will be canceled because of Joe Biden. I‚Äôm guessing Burgess Owens and Greg Hughes just nod in approval. From SL Trib.
Hmm... maybe because he his so far behind Biden? He thinks we are idiots. President Trump reveals he 'too often' regrets his tweets in exclusive interview with Barstool Sports founder
Kamala, I am so sad that you won't be our president in November, but I hold on hope that the Biden/Harris ticket will win out.
He didn't endorse Biden and tell after  It was clear that he was gonna get the nomination. That was the right thing to do I know you don't understand that because you are only about yourself. Oh unaided do a terrible job they fixed the economy look at yours it's in the toilet.
Yes, because it‚Äôs every American woman‚Äôs dream to be a suburban housewife. And of course they need a man to ‚Äúmake it better‚Äù. Listen to AOC and vote Biden -
Under Biden though this will be allot more rampant and everywhere. Imo.
People resist "Socialism" when clearly that's what would save the country. They call Bernie Sanders all kinds of names; but he was the exact candidate to put this country back together. Good luck with Biden, if you can get him.
Exactly, Biden wins the American experiment is over
Biden was VP for 8 years.  Our suburbs are fine.  Moron.
Since according to Joe Biden, Trump is the first racist president, y'all can now stop toppling down statues of past presidents!
What kind of crack did you put in the kool-aid? This is Trump‚Äôs America. NOT Biden‚Äôs
AOC wait until Joe Biden points a finger at you .
Name one thing Joe Biden has done for any Americans .
You are underestimating Biden and CCPüòÇ Biden is hiding out in some basement somewhere and can barely eat pudding at this point ( a little exaggerated but not by much)
Phase ‚Äú4‚Äù fuckum all afrer Joe Biden gets elected
Why you would rather have.someone like Biden run the Country that can't walk or talk
What a joke Biden is
Joe Biden is a good man and a great American. I don't care if he is surrounded by all of the best Dems who do the heavy lifting and prop him up for 4 years. The sinister POS in the WH now is evil and has done irreparable damage to our country
We expect an early night, with president elect Biden taking a victory lap.
Could Turley be any more of a hack at this point.  Biden: trump may try to delay the election.  Trump: says it my be time to delay the election.  Turley: they‚Äôre both equally nuts!
How can it be a vote for Trump when the Right says it is a vote for Biden?  Or maybe nobody owns your damn vote but you, and it goes directly and ONLY to who you vote for.  This faulty logic is why we continue to have a two-party duopoly working in kahoots for their donors
Fascism.  The New York Times: 2020 Election Live Updates: Trump Floats Whether to ‚ÄòDelay the Election,‚Äô Something He Cannot Legally Do.
Politics and culture in this era: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and The Making of the President 1972:
How can you people honestly support Biden when he can't even walk without someone holding his arm, and you people want him as president, why?
Or that Joe Biden was too ambitious to be a suitable Vice President!!!! He‚Äôs literally indicated that he may be a one term president so why should he or his donors care???
Anybody know what Biden's pronouns are.....?
Yes we do....Biden 2020
Just an Idea?  Nov 4th After we have both Houses of Congress, Impeach tRump, Pence &amp; Barr Jan 15th after we swear The new members in send it to the NEW SENATE. tRump &amp; Co will be kicking Horse Turds by the 20th of Jan! Before Biden is in.
Finally, I don‚Äôt want to hear about what Obama and Biden DID. I want to hear about what Biden WOULD DO NOW. He isn‚Äôt Barack Obama. Also, I find the jab at Trump to be lame, and stooping to his level, even though I get that it‚Äôs boilerplate stuff during a campaign.
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ you think Biden is going to be President? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ funniest thing I‚Äôve read all day üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
A couple of well meaning thoughts on VP Biden‚Äôs statement. I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs calling for prosecution of rioters and advocating that local law enforcement be a part of it. I also don‚Äôt necessarily agree with the President‚Äôs response overall, but bringing in... 1/

No...I'm voting Biden regardless of who he picks.
Yes and no. Because of the electoral college, our individual votes don‚Äôt actually count as an individual vote for the candidate.   The biggest demo that K would draw votes from is the black vote, which overwhelmingly supports Biden, so it would increase the ratio in favor of T.
ü§îü§îü§î just wondering when Biden ran the country? What did he do??
I‚Äôm so sorry ladies. I‚Äôm voting Biden. This gop vet has had enough of this bigoted dictator.
Add this to the things Biden needs to change to earn my vote.  To say I am anti-war is almost an understatement.  #ResistFascism #RightWingFascism #FascistTrump #FascismInTheUSA
I'm confused though. They say they will refuse to support the  platform unless it contains #Medicare4All, but then say they will work extra hard to get Biden elected. So they will fight extra hard to push a platform they don't want, but they won't support the platform? Yikes.

If you vote for Joe Biden, then you're really not that smart.
If Biden wants a $$ contribution from me, he needs to:  - Endorse #MedicareForAll - Condemn Trump for his Gestapo tactics, and roundly condemn the conditions in the law that allowed it - Stop taking corporate PAC money.  That's all he would need to do.  #Biden2020 #M4A #DefundDHS
I just donated again to Biden.  #gop4biden
Fuck Biden,
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Don Winslow  ¬∑ 38m I wish all 350,000 of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Biden will need a small Army of Spec Counselors. Congress, House &amp; Senate will have their hands full of of #RIPGOP Rat Bastards!
Biden is going to need ton's of special counsels. Congress can go after the Psycho's in the House &amp; Senate
Here are some reason why Joe Biden should not be president: 1. The Economy will crash 2. Constant riots 3. Open boarders  4. There will be no police 5. He is just a bad person with Pelosi in general   do you agree?
This is not going to end. Not with Biden. Not until we finally finish the Civil War.
We aren't going to win. That's the point. Biden is not winning. I'm voting for the idiot, but he is not a win. That's what we got wrong about Obama and Clinton and even Carter. They were not wins. They were drugs.
It seems as if it‚Äôs becoming our only option but I am a woman who believes Tara Reid, and struggle with Joe Biden as a candidate as well...
What kind of a person sets off fireworks until 11pm, blasts music until midnight, then trims and mows his lawn at 7 am?  I think I'm on board with destroying the suburbs actually. Biden 2020
Biden does not have to brag about passing the test.   It‚Äôs only given if there is a  suspected mental issue.  Apparently even trumps doctors were concerned.
Unlike Joe Biden, who just swept all that under the rug. Who you voting for Alexander?
Luckily joe Biden has a jobs program
