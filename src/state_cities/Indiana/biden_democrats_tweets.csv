At Noon on January 20, 2021, Joe Biden officially becomes President, regardless of what Trump claims.  It just becomes a matter of getting him out of The White House.
Does Joe mean: ‚ÄúAll 90 days of his, (Biden‚Äôs), Presidency?‚Äù  Hello President Kamala... ü§¢
Nothing funny about Biden as Potus. He is a danger to our country.
Watch Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, break down what a Biden administration would have done differently and what we would do now to get this virus under control
Biden though? He is a puppet
Exactly. People aren't necessarily fired up to vote for Joe Biden, but they're going to crawl over broken glass to vote AGAINST Trump, so it doesn't really matter that Biden isn't as energizing as other candidates.
You know I cannot wait for the presidential debates start!! Trump is going to tear Biden a new ass hole‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è
Yes, that explains why Biden is...  Checks notes...  ...continuing to expand his lead....
Imagine waking up in the middle of the night outside Peter Paul‚Äôs house &amp; it‚Äôs just like Seattle, Portland, Chicago happening on Pete‚Äôs street...the mobs-the riots-the gun violence...this is the result of electing Biden President. I‚Äôm betting Peter Paul wouldn‚Äôt like that scene!
No more talk you friking freak unfit the guy is a billionaire because his mind is as sharp as a two edged sword and he speaks truth. Listen to mr Biden ? You can‚Äôt understand a word the guy says. Your a robot my bad
Looking forward to Bars investigations on Obama and Biden can‚Äôt wait until they both are convicted of treason! Stop spreading your lies about one of the greatest presidents freedom has ever created!
Are you nuts? Trump supporters are Blind? Have you lost your fricking mind ? Are you aware of the type of person Joe Biden is. Have you not been paying attention to Biden as he can‚Äôt even complete a fricking sentence? Get a grip!
Helpful tip for voting: Don‚Äôt think of it as voting for Biden, think of it as voting out Trump :)
We will being casting our vote for Biden.
They‚Äôve been trying to drive Biden‚Äôs negatives up for months now, it‚Äôs not working. Biden‚Äôs reputation for decades has been the personable, blue collar fighter for the middle class and people know him as that so well that their opinions are cemented.
Looking forward to trump ripping Biden a new butt hole at the debates‚ÄºÔ∏è
Biden has to be considered a heavy favorite right now. 100 days left. Trump is running out of time to turn things around.
Pollsters are also so paranoid after 2016 that it makes it easy to ignore a simple truth: Biden is leading Trump in swing states by large margins and he should be considered the heavy favorite as of right now.
Biden built the worst track record in politicsNo one believes Biden is to the left of Sanders. No one.
Here's the video by Salty Cracker about Biden saying lock up rioters
Joe Biden has just pissed off the left. Joe Biden said that's it time for the rioters and looters to be locked up and that the need to be in jail.  Fuck!!!!!  Joe Biden actually said something I agree with.
Ari Fleischer thinks assuming Trump will attempt lawless things is ‚Äúirresponsible.‚Äù  thought it was irresponsible of Biden to suggest Trump might want to delay the election. That was in April. Trump will always make you look like an authoritarian-loving fool.
I agree I felt American when Bush and Obama and Biden were in office everyone cared. Now with 45 in feel alot of more people are hating and I feel 45 wants to start a civil war in our own country. Honestly if 45 won I know he won't be if he did I would prefer to move to Canada
I'm reading tweets from other Republicans I've blocked because there are so rude about Biden.  Why are they so rude to him.  I wish they would wake up and go to a hospital and see people are really dying and need change and care with Biden
Thank you for voting for Biden this November from a Democrat. we need to be a team and crush 45
This shit is coming out of the ass of Biden's running mate.
Dr. Biden has a PhD, was the only second lady to hold a paying job while her husband was in office, and would be the most educated First Lady we‚Äôve ever had.  she is more than somebody‚Äôs wife. Give her the respect she deserves, dammit.
Wasn‚Äôt sure if  had a PhD or a medical degree. Asked: ‚ÄúAlexa, what is Jill Biden‚Äôs profession?‚Äù Alexa: ‚ÄúJill Biden is a political wife‚Äù üòê
That's a good choice!
That's what I love.  Keep up with these press conferences.  Only helps Biden creating a massive tidal wave this November
thank you for supporting Biden this November.  I can't stand 45s press conference.  What about you
No patriot will agree on mail in votes. Either wait for everything to open up for the election of open the polls up on November 3rd so we can have a fair and unbiased election. Let the people vote for their candidate instead of cheating to help Biden win.
Seriously my grandpa died of the virus.  Trump has no care. Biden wouldn't do this.
I think Biden had a great quote when someone asked him about that. Without looking it up, I think it was "The white house has a system for dealing with trespassers".
I don't know enough about them to have any particular opinion. I just know I'll vote for Biden no matter what, and I'll just have to go from there. For what little I've read about Abrams, I like her, but Harris seems like a force.
McConnell and McCarthy do not want to be tarred and feathered along with Trump.
if your thesis is that trump sustains inequality and your antithesis is that biden sustains inequality then isn't your synthesis that the election doesn't matter at all?
This + marijuana legalization = canary. Biden is in lead because he's lucky not smart
That's why Biden will make a big tidal wave in November over 45
If this is true then Biden just gave the victory to Trump. Rumors online that Biden may have picked his VP, Kamala Hairyass, if this is true Trump just won.
This doesn‚Äôt quite pass the smell test. Would guess the Biden ‚Äúallies‚Äù are just folks who prefer to boost a different candidate, for whatever reason. Kamala Harris is the most obvious choice, and quite likely the best choice. But I‚Äôm good with whichever finalist Joe selects.
Not just about Biden. The Epstein files too.
In fact I don‚Äôt think I pay enough in taxes, please President Biden, take my money!!
This is why we need to vote like never before for Biden.  Voting is so easy.  Heck a 5 year old could vote.  Vote by mail early voting anything.
That's not right hes not protecting our troops.  Hes suppose to protect all Americans. Right now over 150,000 dead and American troops dead. This should be impeachment.  We need Biden asap
We need 1 more state to be comfortable.  Which state do you think Biden will win to get over 270. I think Arizona
Biden looks trim and is dressed well, but being led by the arm doesn‚Äôt make for an inspiring image. Hard to imagine a recent president allowing this video to take place. Not that pols are pushed and led by aides, this just looks a bit too needy.
"Antifa are courageous Americans." - Joe Biden   Yes this was one of the dumb things Biden said.  "Antifa are peaceful protesters." - Joe Biden   Yes he's said that too, more then once.
Looks like they‚Äôre filming a remake ‚Äî ‚ÄúWeekend at Biden‚Äôs‚Äù
I'm in a Republican state too unfortunately where the currrent vp was governor of . Keep spreading the word.  Texas can turn around anything if Biden gets that and Republicans would be ticked off
The nation voted for joe Biden to be the democratic candidate, and he is already ahead in the polls. Yes, ppl can vote according to their beliefs, but we have to be realistic here....a vote for you is a vote for trump. Period.
I love the panda picture you have.  I've always been a Democrat.  We need Biden asap.  I can't take 4 more months of 45
just wondering are you voting for Biden or trump
Trump has tweeted/retweeted 34 times today, attacking the intelligence community, mayors, U.S. election, and Joe Biden.
We should all vote for Biden. We should all be critical of Biden. We should all hold the DNC and Biden accountable. We should not be content.
Splitting the vote is not a myth, it‚Äôs basic math. Biden has been running for over a year &amp; knows how Washington works. There is virtually no chance of you winning....
BIDEN - HARRIS can‚Äôt wait!!!
Politico either had this ‚Äúin case‚Äù (never a bad idea, since once the pick is announced a story will be needed immediately) OR, less likely, Biden‚Äôs camp tipped some media off for a more scripted rollout.
I would be very mad at 45 in your state right he. He didn't say stay safe because of the hurricane your state suffered from.  Hasn't said anything.  Biden said stay safe.  He would be in your state helping people
Amen we need Biden right now
At least when Biden gets the codes they‚Äôll be the real ones. They gave Trump a lottery ticket and told him the numbers were the nuclear codes.
We need Biden asap
What does the July 2016 thru January 2017 Obama/Biden/FBI timeline look like?
That's something I need to improve on is to not care as much what people think.  Another thing of mine is not voter shaming people no matter if they vote Biden or Howie. There are reasons for voting both as you outlined, and that's good you're voting your conscience.
I really don't know what to do man. It feels like no matter which direction I go, Howie or Biden, I'll have people mad at me. It sucks, dude. I said very recently that I'll suck it up and vote Biden because Trump is that bad, but Biden's statements today pissed me off so much.
This meme could very well be based on reality knowing how Biden's pea sized brain works.
Great that's promising that Republicans in your state are voting for Biden.  Keep spreading the word
do you think Biden can win Ohio by what your seeing in Ohio
are you voting for Biden or trump
Are you voting for Biden or trump
That's why we need Biden asap before things get worse
I say keep the press conferences going helps Biden alot 45 keeps messing up
I will do anything.  We just need to vote.  I feel we have Pennsylvania and Michigan and the one that will make Biden win will be Arizona
Let him keep with his press conferences.  Helps Biden every single time
Do you think Biden will win in November.  I have a strong feeling he will
Please do everything.  I report everyone who says bad things on Biden its not right it's a lie. We need Biden asap
"I've done some dumb things and I will do dumb things again." - Joe Biden  Yes he actually said this.
Joe Biden and his record of plagiarism
listening to the news and someone says "there is a lot of enthusiasm for Joe Biden."  me "just how powerful is the medication you're taking?"
Even more reasons to keep Biden out of the White House
Do you think this is giving Biden a better chance of winning
It is I just wish Indiana was Democrat state.  By what your seeing in general do you think Biden will win.  I think he will but we have to vote anyway as possible I'm voting by mail
making real productive change has never just been about voting. biden is not going to be there for you any more than trump ever was.
A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn‚Äôt pretty
Still at the end we need Biden asap. I can't stand 4 months
I can't wait for Biden to be elected.
Amen God bless. Are you ok if Biden doesn't pick Harris
are you voting for Biden or trump
To all Texans this November.  Where is trump when your state was struggling with a hurricane over the weekend. not saying stay safe I'll be there soon. He was golfing.  Biden tweeted stay safe nothing from trump I wonder why Thinking that is ü§î
To all Texans this November.  Where is trump when your state was struggling with a hurricane over the weekend. not saying stay safe I'll be there soon. He was golfing.  Biden tweeted stay safe nothing from trump I wonder why ü§î
I'm from Indiana too and voting for Biden
Don't you mean empty with Biden as in his ideas and leadership is empty!?!?
NO WORRIES THERE, SPANKY! IT WILL ATER BIDEN  BEATS YOUR BUTT BY A LANDSLIDE!!!üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
For the sake of our country and our democracy we must elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.  When future generations recall the history of our time, they will say here were Americans who stood up and did the right thing, here were Americans worthy of the name.
Indiana. Probably casting my vote for Joe Biden and Democrats up and down the ticket!
do you think Biden will pick Harris or a different vp
I‚Äôve only seen the trump ad about the protests and it‚Äôs like ‚Äúthis will be America with a Biden presidency!!!‚Äù Which is stupid as hell bc like... that‚Äôs America right now.. with a trump presidency üò≠ I wanna see some juicy ads dammit! Not this lame shit
I just can't survive another 4 years of 45. I pray so hard Biden wins
I'll say that again.  I don't know why people are rude at me because I support Biden.  Is it just me or alot of people rude like that
i hope biden already wrote his memoirs
Joe Biden can‚Äôt identify his wife from his sister.
So I think it may go to Biden if its liberal. Liberals can change their minds
I wish voters in Florida would see this and vote for Biden
This time is different because hes losing in a big blue tidal wave come November 3rd and 4th just get more of your neighbors and friends to vote for Biden
Its a lie anyways . Biden wouldn't ever do that.  Doesn't help anyone change there mind. Reason why he's going to lose is because of racism and the troops and Russia
Sorry if I am mad I just don't like seeing very rude things about Biden. Did you block 45 just wondering
Agree about that. so ridiculous we need Biden asap
I'm reporting alot of account that are posting rude things in Biden. why are people so rude
thank you for the Lincoln project I really love your videos and I'm a Democrat and I will help you anyway as possible to elect Biden this November and get this country to heal
your state is very important in November. please spread the word and keep them coming.  Thank you for voting for Biden this November
Return to school when 45 is out of office and a healer in Biden takes over
Hes throwing hats on the streets and golfing instead of helping Texas which is suffering from a hurricane ü§î. Biden would be on the ground in Texas
45 is throwing hats into crowds going golfing.  While Texas has a hurricane and a virus to deal with. Biden would be going to Texas helping those suffered from the hurricane.  Remember In November
I‚Äôm not going to act like any politician is perfect, or necessarily ethical, but I don‚Äôt see how you can vote for Biden. His only selling point is he hates Trump. Besides that, voters have to understand that they‚Äôre voting for someone who can barely string together a sentence.
Why Biden is polling better than Clinton against Trump
Amen just remember when Biden is elected.  This will take time to fix 45s mess. Maybe a year or more.  Just be patient and he will fix this country step by step.  But 1st please vote November 3rd and early and mail in voting anything
To all Texans voting this November no matter Republican or Democrat.  Do you see 45 saying stay safe because of this hurricane ü§î. Biden did and cares that you stay safe.  Remember this in November
Amen god bless.  Biden cares for everyone no matter what
thank you for your service and thank you for voting for Biden this November. we need someone who cares and heals this country
This is why we need to get rid of 45. Biden wouldn't do that. he would say thank you for your service. if you need support call me. Not attack those who served
They are welcome to vote for Biden, and ro criticize Trump. But they aren't allowed to hijack our Party and nudge us to the right or try to speak for us. Many of them are responsible for the spawning of this incompetent sonofabitch.
Biden should use that.
I love this account thank you for creating it. Thank you for voting for Biden this November and now let's turn Texas blue and get 45 out of office. from a Democrat in a different state
thank you for your service and thank you for voting for Biden this November
Drove up through Western Michigan this weekend, and I couldn't keep count of all the Trump signs and flags on cars, boats, or houses. Looked for a Biden one all trip, and didn't see a single one.
You are sooo delusional, Wacko Donnie sound pretty good 2 me! As 4Biden saying Arizona was a city. That‚Äôs OLD NEWS! You are so disparate u r are grasping at straws! Biden‚Äôs lead is eating u up &amp; it‚Äôs YOUR FAULT. Just like it‚Äôs YOUR FAULT 1,0000 have died&amp; mil r infected w Covid19
This election is going to be a lot closer than most think. Likely-voter polls are tighter than the registered voter polls, VP Biden still has to pick a running-mate that could have big effects on the numbers, and anything could happen in the next 100 days.
Amen I hate those commercials that 45 shows that he will. So not true.  Biden cares for all of us and wants to heal our country
This election is hardly about Trump and Biden, it‚Äôs about two systems &amp; two visions for America. When Truman faced Dewey in 1948, their positions were nearly identical, so voters had to choose the man best suited to be POTUS. By contrast...
Great please spread the word and keep getting people to vote for Biden November 3rd
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Going to the polls will require some measure of nose-holding, surely. I don‚Äôt like to go negative about Biden, but according to Ted Sorensen he was the worst, most superficial pol in DC. He had to withdraw from one Presidential election when his fraudulent work was revealed.
I want Biden to get 70 million more followers please then were up to 45 with his followers
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
That's so sad and 45 doesn't want to even help them.  He wants to build a wall and waste money ü§î. Biden would care and help out everyone who is struggling no matter who you are
Thank you for voting for Biden in November. everyone makes mistakes but the mistake that's in office right now needs to hit the road come November 4th
thank you for your service and thank you for voting for Biden November 3rd
Biden. Anyone but trump and pence
Money doesn't win me over it's care and respect for people which Biden has that wins me over
there is someone on YouTube stating trump has way more searches and views on YouTube than Biden and trump will win. Is YouTube Republican and ignore that
Question do you believe YouTube if 45 has more views videos etc.... than actual polls or do you believe in real change and ignore YouTube and YouTube is Republican and Biden isn't on YouTube much anyways
thank you for your service thank you for your like and thank you for voting for Biden this November
Say that again.  Biden wouldn't let this happen. were America we have money to get results quicker.  Its unfair athletes and politicians and people who have money get results quick
We need Biden now
We did it in 2008, though sadly were one of 2 states to flip back red in 2012. I'm actually hopeful for 2020. Just as there are "secret" Trump voters, there are now many more "secret" Biden voters in conservative areas.
What will you do if Biden wins or 45 wins. My answer if Biden wins I'll stay if 45 wins I'm moving out of this country asap
Biden also won't lie.
WE MUST STUDY OUR BIBLES! Ephesians 6:12. I will read the whole chapter and book in context. Pray without ceasing for ALL. That‚Äôs a reminder to me as well. #Vision Jesus Showed About Donald  Trump and Biden  #JesusIsLord  #Prayer  via
Very scary.  We need Biden now
Thank you please do I pray and beg we need Biden asap
We should get NBC, CBS and cnn pay other countries to help Biden since fox news uses the most dangerous country pay for trump
Thank you for voting all blue this year.  We definitely need change asap I'm not sure if we can survive 4 months but we will win this fight and Biden will heal this country
Biden could take the Oath of Office in a port-a-potty at Noon on January 20, 2021 and Trump would then constitutionally just be a citizen trespassing on federal property.
When shit gets deep? It gets REAL deep! Being with Biden needs to be ALL OF of us VOTING!!!
I want to see 70 million more followers follow Biden then Biden will be winning in followers on Twitter
Biden true people who care and love and struggle.  The disabled the elderly parents people who only get 50,000 and under.  Low class income middle class income
I'm voting for Biden because he will fight for our lives and not save  himself and maybe for desert he will give us universal basic income
I wish he gave the codes to dr. Fauci then I know we are really safe then Fauci can give them safely to Biden November 3rd
Amen god bless please vote for Biden in Florida Floridians we need you more than ever to heal this country before it gets worse #Biden2020 tidal wave
What's your opinion on 45 lowering drug prices and healthcare costs right now ? I thinks it's 4 months too late over 4 million cases and over 140,000 deaths.  We need Biden who cares for us and will heal us #Biden2020 tidal wave
I can't imagine how Biden blows this lead if the COVID and economy situation doesn't improve rapidly.
And this is senator Robert Byrd being endorsed by vice prez Biden. Senator Byrd was a high ranking member of the KKK and started his own chapter in W. VA.
If  isn't on  short list for a running mate, she ought to be.   With Lee at his side, Biden would improve his prospects to win over progressives and make clear his commitment to dismantling structural racism.
No he doesn‚Äôt. But he‚Äôs been brainwashed by the American Government to think Marxism = Worse than cancer   And Joe Biden is not a Marxist. Lmao. Watching stoolies try to talk politics is good stuff
who's joe biden
Amen God bless thank you Biden for caring
Someday' s  I wake up and think I'm in the 1920's - Joe Biden  Sounds like a great choice for our nations leader. üòÅüëé
Joe Biden does not have a healthy mind to lead the United States. #Trump2020
And Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt know the difference between a wife and a sister.
I feel Biden is great just the way he is.  He cares for everyone
your state is so important for Biden please spread the word
Biden don't know why Trump calls it the Chinese virus because Americans can't distinguish between Korea and China because their both Asian. First off that was racist Creepy Joe, and second it's said the virus came from China.
What the hell is Biden talking about. The nurses breathed in my nostrils to get me moving. This dude is fucked in the head. Nurses blow in his nostrils, kids play with his hairy legs, he knows about roaches. This can't possibly be who the left chose to take on Trump.
Florida is so crucial for Biden
Typical straw an arguments. No one anywhere in this thread claimed to be democratic, or claimed to support Biden/Trump. Just bringing them up to try and dismiss the fair criticism people have of your idol. Man these people worship trump like Jesus Christ it‚Äôs sad üòÇ
Omg love this.  Keep Republicans going to vote for Biden and Biden will heal this country
Or have pregnant moms afraid to have a baby due to the virus which the president isn't taking care of and Biden would
Please keep spreading the word.  Even if 10 people change there mind. That's 10 votes for Biden.  It disappoints me that people don't wear masks. Its like a seatbelt. If you care about your health then wear a mask
Keep praying for Biden to win
I love your former governor who was a Republican is for Biden and speaking at the convention
your in a very important state.  Do you think Floridians will vote for Biden and change the state blue by what your seeing?
Just donated 10 dollars to Biden campaign.  He needs our support #Biden2020
when did you decide that you want to vote for Biden
Some people are rude to people who support Biden on Twitter.  I've gotten rude tweets from trump supporters and liberals
This is actually footage of America right now. Biden isn‚Äôt President...
Multiple ways to read this, but "We'd rather negotiate with Biden than with Navarro and Lighthizer" is currently at the top of my list.

Imagine being a white liberal woman who wants folks to vote Biden so badly that she thinks no black people could possibly be anti-Biden leftists.  Have you not studied American history, Becca? Or American current events?
Joe Biden narrows down his VP list, with Karen Bass emerging as one of several key contenders
Joe Biden is expected to announce his running mate next week; all of the perceived frontrunners are pro-abortion &amp; support the LGBT agenda.  Given Biden's issues with mental fitness, his VP choice is likely to take over at some point, should he win.
As a (Black) suburban mother, I knew exactly what that coded language meant. He was saying if Biden is elected, the Black folk are moving to the suburbs(OMG!). Dude, we‚Äôre already here and we love it!
If Trump pounded a much better candidate and had no record the first time, his defeat of Biden will be epic.
I‚Äôve never considered voting for Joe Biden because he‚Äôs never considered Medicare for All, not even in the midst of a pandemic and not even when nearly 90 percent of Dem voters want it.
If Biden doesn‚Äôt want to move further left when he needs our votes the most, how are we gonna get him to even consider fighting for M4A, green new deal or any other progressive policies when he‚Äôs in office already? Please enlighten me..
I don‚Äôt know.  It‚Äôs 50/50.  Biden isn‚Äôt hated the way Hillary is.  If Biden avoids public speaking and debates, he just might win.
I‚Äôd be happy with any of the ladies but I‚Äôm putting my money on Rep. Val Demmings, she checks all the boxes and has the kind of gravitas to balance Biden out.
Biden won‚Äôt be writing them. Just like he doesn‚Äôt write them now. #DementiaJoe
Would I be able to make a sign and put it on my yard? Side of barn? On my truck? How about if I have a delivery truck, can I put political ads on it and pay someone to drive around? Can I buy a TV ad for Biden or Hale? I‚Äôd put ‚Äúpaid for by Rob‚Äù at the end üôÇ
Plus, some of the age/oratory jokes (while still in poor taste) might actually *land* if Biden‚Äôs opponent were, in contrast, cogent and able to descend a ramp.
Biden didn‚Äôt write this. It‚Äôs sick what the left is doing to this dementia stricken and confused man. #DemocratsTheEnemyWithin
Well. Biden is losing it. Doesn‚Äôt even know where he is half the time. And obviously I don‚Äôt have to explain Trump
Just saw an email about Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren having a fundraiser tomorrow, on the day that he's scheduled to make his VP pick. Hmmm
Another way to avoid unwanted hair is to avoid being a waitress for Dodd and Kennedy.

If you want to defeat Trumpism, not just the man, then Joe Biden ain‚Äôt your guy.  Joe Biden said ‚Äúnothing will fundamentally change‚Äù if he‚Äôs elected.  He‚Äôll set the conditions for Trumpism to come back with a vengeance in 2022 and 2024.  We don‚Äôt have time for this.
Isn‚Äôt the point that the Federal Government shouldn‚Äôt dictate local zoning against the wishes of a state or city?    IE. the Biden/Sanders/Booker plan to start enforcing Obama‚Äôs Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing initiative.
Could Barack Obama serve in the Biden Administration?  Secretary of State ... asking an expert.
Harris is not going to help get the black vote because, to quote Biden, 'you aint that black!'
Listen to the scientific evidence. Biden is lucid and in a daydream of dementia.
Best neighbors I could ever have: Hispanic, Korean, Slovakian, Chinese, Black, White, Indian, Irish, and more. All awesome  AMERICAN Neighbors! YOU DO NOT REPRESENT ME! YOUR ‚Äúnews‚Äù disgusts me! YES I‚ÄôM VOTING FOR BIDEN!
Biden has dementia, his shuffling walk, confused speech, someone constantly leading him or telling him what to say. This is the Democrat candidate for the Presidency! They‚Äôre all looney!
Police protecting human life is not Biden‚Äôs focus

Wait, are you implying Biden is in charge right now? He's the one overseeing the country eat itself apart? Or is it Trump fueling the protests with secret police and tear gassing people for photo ops? How deluded you have to be to think Biden has played any role in where this is
Biden‚Äôs notes on very simple concepts and ideas - good;  briefing notes on complex foreign and domestic issues - bad
That is a the most hilarious thing I have heard in a long time. Clearly you were just a child and didn‚Äôt have to pay bills back then. Thankfully President Trump brought us back from eight years of Obama and Biden.
If it‚Äôs not Stacey then Biden‚Äôs a racist.
Yeah, hiding in the basement and refusing to talk. That‚Äôs LEADERSHIP at its best. LOL. To be clear, I‚Äôm not defending Trump at all. I‚Äôm completely shitting on Biden.
By Chump I assume u mean Biden
Ramblin' stumblin' Joe.  #Biden2020 #Biden
Watching Biden's "Press Conference" Obviously staged. He has a list of media and is calling "them" to ask questions, nothing random about it.

I‚Äôm grocery shopping at Meijer in Carmel, IN, one of the most historically Republican cities in the country. I‚Äôve had 3 compliments for my mask and saw a Joe Biden bumper sticker in the parking lot. It‚Äôs super anecdotal, but I‚Äôm feeling the momentum that it‚Äôs gonna be a #BlueWave
Biden is an idiot. Does that mean all prior elections were stolen because no main in votes?
I am surprised that NC is tied. Thought Biden would be up 3-5. I am surprised that Minn is only +3. Am surprised Texas is +2. I'll believe that when I see it.

A presidential candidate has declared that he will force Americans to fund Planned Parenthood. This would undo a litany of reforms put in place by the Trump Administration.   We cannot lose the progress we have made to protect life.
Trump is amplifying this whack job and minimizing Fauci...and people are questioning Biden‚Äôs mental fitness? Holy crap!
Joe Biden has more strength, intelligence, integrity and morals in his pinky finger than you could ever wish for!Your lies about Joe only shows YOUR DESPERATION because Joe is massively polling double digits across the country ESPECIALLY MICH., Pennsylvania, WISCONSIN AND FLORIDA

Trump convinced me to vote for Biden.
Same here....heading back to the UP Thursday and last yime there not a single Biden sign or bumper sticker
They‚Äôre stuck with Biden. Everyone hates Hillary anyway.
Hey Biden, when do you plan on passing?
Well, considering Trump bailed on one of the GOP actual televised primary debates last year, Biden skipping a FOX interview is no biggie for many of us!

But PA will be voting for Biden because they have no faith in you Donnie!
And for the people who truly think 4 more years of Trump is virtually the same as a President Biden your privelage has gone unchecked for far too long. #AmericaWakeUp
Chip in to elect Joe Biden  I just gave $100 and I'm recently unemployed!
If he thinks there is no enthusiasm on the left, it's because people are asking the wrong question.  It's not "how enthusiastic are you to vote for Biden", it's "how enthusiastic are you to vote to remove Trump"
Absolutely.  I'm not waiting in super long lines during this pandemic.  But if I have to, I will to make sure that Biden gets my vote!
Except the difference here is that Biden knows when he misspeaks, unlike you, who would have gone to your grave claiming AZ was a city... you probably would have even used a sharpie to make your case.
There is really no need for debating. Trump will just lie and call Biden names. And he won‚Äôt answer the asked questions. The downside beats the upside If Biden debates.
Biden is our candidate
Good point. I don't want a Biden presidency but we won't survive another four years of Trump. However, I don't see Biden completing his term so the VP pick will be #47.
Ug I'm not in favor of Harris. Biden can do better.
We need black athletes to follow in Muhammad Ali footprints and be racemen not Democratic shills. This is all in hopes of reigning in a Biden victory. Biden doesn't have a Black agenda and pledges his focus to LGBTQ and immigrant issues. I'm not impressed.
I have so much money ready to spend on Biden-Harris 2020 swag.

Stip by this weekend we have United for Biden signs,  I also have one Pete for Joe 2020 left üåü
So are you suggesting we vote for Biden to avoid a greater temper tantrum among looney liberals?
I‚Äôd be willing to bet several paychecks that if Biden wins we‚Äôll immediately see articles about what concessions must be made to LP Republicans since they helped him win. Guaranteed. Concessions needing to be made to progressives for same? Crickets.
Biden should not get 1 Christian vote....period!

Can you imagine if Biden were to throw out the first pitch? It would be like the old married couple playing golf in Caddyshack. "...Your ball is over here Mr. Haverkamp."
It‚Äôs actually not required . Not his call. Biden will take the oath on Jan 21. If necessary he will escorted out of the White House.

President Trump is crushing Sleepy Joe Biden in current polls in the swing states where it matters.  President Trump is running away with the lead in polling where it matters.  Sleepy Joe may be slightly ahead of the President in Delaware but that may be it.  FOX Sample = 48% Dem

If Biden wins Florida, it‚Äôs all over.
and that goes into play with his finical donation to Biden?  that‚Äôs a reach...  it‚Äôs the headline to create thread/ clicks.  it‚Äôs him trying to take to task nba and players commissioner picking what‚Äôs their concern to fight for...  1/2
Now it will be because of you that VP Biden is elected President. You‚Äôve done a terrible job!
Philadelphia Prosecutor Threatens to Arrest Feds Sent to His City    ...."Since Biden appears to be tacitly encouraging the violence, he becomes an easy target for the Trump campaign to paint as a dangerous radical..."
He is goading Joe Biden to take a test that Trump knows Biden will fail.  Clever.
Put Biden through this interview and see what happens.
Unbelievable! One of the few Governors who did it right needs to be impeached? If it weren‚Äôt so important to elect VP Biden, I‚Äôd write him in on the ballot for President. You, Mr. Rand, are a conspiracy wacko who needs to go!
Maybe he is confusing Biden and Trump. Has he taken the cognition test?
This is why we don‚Äôt trust the polls. They say Biden is ahead and then only 19 people listen to his live-streaming.What is the prob with KH? Biden needs a relentkess attack dog, though Rice better qualified to take over in energency
Imagine being a white liberal woman who wants folks to vote Biden so badly that she thinks no black people could possibly be anti-Biden leftists.  Have you not studied American history, Becca? Or American current events?
Also they just said he was pulling his ad buying to change their message.  "Sleepy Joe" has been his lame message since the start. He has been afraid of Biden or else he would never have asked for help beating Joe. #TrumpHasLost
Hmmm...your losing in Texas and Florida as well. Sleepy Joe is very a old and tired cliche. You need something with more relevance.  Something like "Joe Biden would never tear gas your Mom like I will" That shows Americans your toughness.
Yes and he must walk through a two columns of people - Black Lives Matter Protesters on the left and Moms and Veterans whom he gassed on the right - on his way to the police van. Biden and Obama get to shut the doors on the vehicle - and America returns to her greatness.
You WILL know like 4 hours after the polls open. Biden with 85% of the electoral college locked up. That leaves no way to protest the results. Have no fear, the Blue Wave is poised to roll tide on November 3rd, voter suppression or no, it wont matter.
The newspapers in the state that he Governs has to beg him for help - and he loves and cherishes every second of that because to him, that makes him powerful.  He's nothing but a spineless, sycophant, small-minded Trump follower who, once Biden takes office will not last long.
I‚Äôve never considered voting for Joe Biden because he‚Äôs never considered Medicare for All, not even in the midst of a pandemic and not even when nearly 90 percent of Dem voters want it.

I‚Äôd be happy with any of the ladies but I‚Äôm putting my money on Rep. Val Demmings, she checks all the boxes and has the kind of gravitas to balance Biden out.

Biden didn‚Äôt write this. It‚Äôs sick what the left is doing to this dementia stricken and confused man. #DemocratsTheEnemyWithin
Well. Biden is losing it. Doesn‚Äôt even know where he is half the time. And obviously I don‚Äôt have to explain Trump
My history of Presidential voting:   2000:George Bush 2004:George Bush 2008:Ron Paul 2012:Gary Johnson 2016:Gary Johnson 20220: Joe Biden   Weird evolution that probably isn't that uncommon.
Seems like today would be a good day for future president Biden to announce his VP. Take back the narrative and assure us all Nov. 3rd the trump nightmare is over.#NobodyLikesTrump
There you have it, folks! He tried extortion, suppression, and every other ‚ÄúShell Game Parlor Trick to rig this election. Now he‚Äôs flat out saying, STOP the election, because I can‚Äôt beat Biden 1 on 1.
By "looking pretty good" she means that its pretty clear Joe Biden is going to walk all over Trump on 11/03/.2020 without any delays in the election. She and her siccophant, mindless, spineless followers all become irrelevant on 11/03/2020 and not a day later!  Buh-bye Laura!!!
Lowkey super fucked up that a president wants to delay being voted out. I think biden will win bc all my conservative family members seem to be on board but to me hes just as bad, we truly need revolution
Joe Biden's job will be easy. Just do the absolute opposite of whatever Trump did. We will have national allies again, we will beat this virus together, we will began to have equality for all, corporations will finally pay their share, and we can all sleep again. #Biden2020
This one is easy. He is no longer president. Biden is and Biden then assumes military control just as Trump has. So Biden, smiling all the way, simply orders the military to throw him out. Any officer not following that order is guilty of treason. Period. This is a non-issue
If you want to defeat Trumpism, not just the man, then Joe Biden ain‚Äôt your guy.  Joe Biden said ‚Äúnothing will fundamentally change‚Äù if he‚Äôs elected.  He‚Äôll set the conditions for Trumpism to come back with a vengeance in 2022 and 2024.  We don‚Äôt have time for this.
On top of ensuring Texas forgives all taxes for Elon Musk to build his new plants in Texas. Yet, he's STILL behind in polls in Texas according to CNN and Reuters. And Biden and Lincoln Projects ads start hitting there soon. #Biden2020
What are the odds that lady is voting Joe Biden?
Yes Donnie, keep it up. The more you push, the lower your polling numbers go. Americans love your plan and will show up in droves to vote - for Joe Biden.
If Biden wins, every business will be booming. Covid will be magically over. #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica
YOU are my President Joe Biden. Not in November - right the F now!!! You are EXACTLY what we Americans need to bring light back to our battered Trumpain dystopic wasteland.  Your victory cannot happen quick enough.
Biden and trump both will see the guillotines
Unfortunately just as many think a biden presidency fixes this. We need true revolution and both parties have made it clear peaceful revolution wont be tolerated
Trump is amplifying this whack job and minimizing Fauci...and people are questioning Biden‚Äôs mental fitness? Holy crap!
We plan to on 11/03/2029. Biden - 70%  Trump - 30%  with Mothers and veterans. Turns out tear gassing Americans who vote is not a great idea. I‚Äôll tell you this since your campaign manager won‚Äôt.
Mr. Biden is very smart to wait until the final second. It drives Trump batshit crazy not knowing, and it saves whomever he chooses from the immediate media smear that is coming. But I'm with you, I can;t wait to see whom he  chooses.
Biden‚Äôs Campaign Advisor
His "team" said he was going to focus on the issues and tweet less. They lied obviously. Also if it is "illegal" to tweet bad things about people, he should be jailed. Have you seen the filth he tweets about Obama, Biden, Hilary, even Fox News? Will he ever make sense?
Biden didn‚Äôt give Putin a BJ in Helsinki....Trump did. Case closed.
For those keeping score, Biden's lead in Texas and Florida grew again today in all national polls. Yes I know polls don't win elections, votes do.I will do whatever I have to to vote for Joe Biden and WHOMEVER his VP is. But my heart loves seeing Joe's lead grow in the polls
It is so easy to 2nd guess a President that has had to face a health crisis that is unprecedented in our country‚Äôs modern history, and given 6 months like Biden has been given, he may have done a few things differently, but still made life-saving decisions.
And his job tenure will be shortest on record. He is gone after 11/03/2020. President Biden will not stand for it. This goon and all the other complicit people Trump installed with no qualifications or merits.  America will be back from this Trump golf vacation on 11/03/2020
Translation:What we already knew. When Biden wins, the election will be deemed ‚Äúrigged‚Äù by Trump and his Cult.The ? is, will Trump try to ‚ÄúExecutive Order‚Äùan attempt to overrule our laws,again, and use crook AG Barr to rubber stamp it. Remember, he‚Äôs trying to avoid a prison cell
The polls will tighten. It‚Äôs inevitable. However, if Biden gets 51% of the vote in certain states, he can‚Äôt lose...unless Betsy DeVos is doing the counting.
I love it that Biden is leading in Florida. DeSantis has done everything except legally change his last name to Trump to appease his master. Now he owns the largest hotspot of Covid in the US, got caught faking death numbers, can't get rallys or conventions held. WINNING!
President Biden, as a celebration victory lap, should invite voters to come and "knock the hell out of that wall until there is nothing left."  It would be so symbolic of America's change back into a free society and away from fascism.
But PA will be voting for Biden because they have no faith in you Donnie!
Im gonna vote third party. Biden helped build the rigged system that allows fascism 2 run rampant. Cant vote for someone who is morally corrupt. I think a vote for either biden or trump is a wasted vote and I personally believe its clear that peaceful revolution wont be tolerated
There is really no need for debating. Trump will just lie and call Biden names. And he won‚Äôt answer the asked questions. The downside beats the upside If Biden debates.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.

We are only 3 1/2 months away from election. You will not change a Trumpers mind (theres little to work with there anyway). Resisters love and know Dr. Fauci is a source of truth. Reps. are wasting their money and time. When Mr. Biden announces his VP this election is over.
In a million years dt couldn‚Äôt be this normal. That‚Äôs it. Normal. Biden is normal. Dt is fkn weird man. He‚Äôs like a late night sneaky uncle, the dirty old man that always looks at the girls through his shades, like a snake.
Fun fact: Trump would also currently lose to Biden in the rest of the free world - except for Russia and Saudi Arabia.   So at least he has a couple of choices to move to after January 2021.  Look for more Goya ads from the entire Trump family emanating from the USSR in January.
Biden should not get 1 Christian vote....period!
I love that  is waiting until the last second to announce his candidate. A) this is driving Trump crazy because it takes time to create all the smear ads against that person, and B) Biden has already told the person who it is so they can have they pressers ready. Smart.
IE, he did not.  Instead he got information about the red folders given to the Republicans who were in Russia on July 4th. Its just fake dirt on Biden more than likely.
I wish it would end if/when Trump loses the election on November 3, but you know he will be doing some crazy shit until Biden is sworn into office.
Keep gassing the Moms Don and keep forcing them to choose whether to send their kids to face Covid at school. It will continue to do wonders for the Biden polls.  Never change!

He's telling them Biden will take their homes as his Graffiti Gestapo tear gasses them as they peacefully protest. Then he forces them to send their kids to school to face Covid. I believe he injected bleach directly into his brain. He's gone mentally.

Champions keep their foot on the gas. Don‚Äôt let up. If Biden‚Äôs up by 15, he needs to make it 20 by Election Day. If they drag Trump out of the WH 1-20-21, they need to lock him up right away, because he will be a flight risk. Bill Barr as well.

WTF you expect Biden to die by 2024
Biden should make the announcement tomorrow and put an end to it.

Note that this was also in this same op-ed: ‚ÄúBiden accused the president of trying to make it harder for people to vote by mail by defunding or otherwise hindering the Postal Service‚Äôs operations. There‚Äôs absolutely no proof Trump wants to do that, but that didn‚Äôt stop Biden.‚Äù
That‚Äôs true! If Biden wins, they will riot a bit! Until somebody riots back! Then it‚Äôs back to yellow flags with snakes on them!
I have no idea why people in major cities and on the coast are so sure Biden will win. I'm in Michigan/Indiana, and it is looking like Trump voters have sheer excitement to vote. Meanwhile anyone formerly a Democrat is like "meh" the DNC F***ed us again.

Black people who don't vote for Biden are useless? That's what you mean?
Right? I understand the media has an agenda too. I make my own decisions. Which is why I didn't vote for Clinton. I don't like Biden either but he is the lesser of the two evils.  Trump will be a 1 term president and so will Biden.

Trump carried Michigan in 2016 by a narrow 10,704-vote margin. The new CNN poll put Biden on top there by 52% to 40%. Another poll released Sunday, from CBS/YouGov, showed Biden leading by 6 points.
Awww, someone's been reading about his tanking poll numbers, especially in Florida. And Pennsylvania's Biden's home state, Doofus.
And this is why you are one of the most corrupt Presidents ever. Because Joe Biden Don't need Russia or China to help them Win the election. Joe Biden will Win because he is an honest and caring and honorable man. He's not killing Americans with Trump Virus, or Golfing. Vote Nov3
Joe Biden can shoot someone on fifth Avenue and won't lose a vote.
If nothing has moved you to ore Biden, this should do it...
Despite the former VP's lead - more of Trump‚Äôs voters strongly back him than Biden‚Äôs supporters do, and the president holds a significant lead on handling the economy.

JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Joe Biden is running a campaign like a person who is kicking Donald Trump's ass, even in the FOX POLLS by at least 11 points! Also you say the Democrats are losing really bad, Joe is winning in some polls by 20 points, if you call that losing, we rather stay on the losing side.
Biden probably plagiarized quotes from the movie for his speeches.  LOL
Biden was on MSNBC five days ago!
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
You will beat Biden off ?
All you and Sean Hannity complain about is how far Joe Biden is going left. That's the way Democrats go and  Republicans go right. Do ya'll actually think the Democrats should go, FAR RIGHT! You don't know how ignorant ya'll sound!
Cardi talks with Biden about Trump not apologizing and using the right production for coronavirus. Trump is not doing anything that contains better benefits and I agree with both of them when they were on IG live. That makes him think precisely about not caring.

And here's a troubling current matter. #MSM, STOP dwelling on the 'horse race' and Biden's lead in the polls! I've no doubt Biden will prevail among voters. Rather, the issue is massive efforts to suppress voters and meddling the voting process. Follow  !
Everyone better vote for Biden no matter who he picks for VP. Cry, debate, even fight for your person, but don‚Äôt you dare let it keep you from the polls.
Biden is up 13 points ahead of Trump in Florida. F-L-O-R-I-D-A. Just thought you'd like to know.
In a  poll out today, Biden has a 9-point lead over Trump in Michigan and an 11-point lead in Pennsylvania. Both states that Trump won in 2016.
Does this horse's ass Gidley know that Biden is ahead of Trump by 13 points in Florida??? FLORIDA.
Biden's ahead of you by 13 points in Florida. FLORIDA. Just thought you'd like to be reminded.
Sean played some of Joe Biden's gaffes to suggest that he's not all there. But, Joe is still smashing Trump, even in FOX POLLS by 11 points, 20 points in another &amp; from 13 to 9 in 4 swing states. So that should tell you what people think of Trump's competency. Trump's Doomed!

So, I guess Joe Biden is going to do the same thing at his political rallies that Clinton tried to pull off in 2016.  Does anyone else remember the photoshopped crowds of excited people that HRC's PR team tried to pull off 4 years ago?
Yep. You can be conservative and vote for Joe Biden. You can't be conservative and vote for Joe Biden AND hope for a Dem Senate.

Joe Biden is the worst public speaker to ever run for President.
So are you saying you were wrong or what? It sounds like you are still just trying to justify your previous column about Biden. Are you that willfully ignorant of Donald Trump. There is no norm that he won't challenge or line he won't cross. Have you gotten out your tin foil hat?
I am a #Biden voter but trust that I am saddened by the loss of Mr. Cain. He was way GOP choice in 2012. But Mitt won the nomination and I became a Mitt campaigner.   My condolences on your loss.

Governor Carney would then have to name another Senator to fill the new vacancy, so he could give Senator Coons his seat back...  So, a canceled election means we get Joe Biden, or an election means we get Joe Biden. Life isn't terrible.  6/?

And another thing, just because I pick Biden doesn't mean I'm liberal, I'm very much in the middle when it comes to our political parties

Wrong. The Democrats are still Republican lite. The Republicans are at least honest with their contempt. Democrats haven‚Äôt really cared about the under served in decades. Action speaks louder then words. I want Biden to win but I don‚Äôt want the old Democrat party.

No big surprise. He's got "his African Americans" and he doesn't hesitate to show his disdain for the rest. Hopefully he'll regret this at the ballot box. Trump says he won‚Äôt go and pay respects to John Lewis at Capitol

Biden sucks and can‚Äôt hold a conversation without his dementia peaking out. My husband and I were physically assaulted by a man wearing a Biden mask because when he asked us if we voted for Trump we said yes. So glad you are all so tolerant they way you say you are.

Trump is worse, but Biden definitely has said and done questionable things. I really don't like either of them.
Interesting, although if it's a close result then we could be fucked. We need Biden to wipe the floor with him. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Mike -- I'm hopeful for virtual basement debates. Based on the handful of Biden virtual broadcasts that I've seen to date, I believe Zoom debates between Trump &amp; Biden would be both entertaining and draw very clear contrasts between the candidates. :)

Great newsletter! I imagine the insider perspective will help with the analysis of the Biden campaign. Do you see the Trump campaign as more atypical and therefore more difficult to evaluate? Or do you think they‚Äôve become more ‚Äútraditional‚Äù since 2016?
4 years down the line think about those same women and how we will b voting for the next president  After Biden who would b right there wit the experience of the white house behind them cuz right now its only Michelle that's ready but that's ok we trust her we know her she needed
Biden picks Michelle Michelle brings in Abrams and Harris show them the ropes and Val she strong too I like her show them how to stand strong in this white man world without stumbling over words cant di that in this world as a black lady flaws have to b at minimum.

Worth seeing. Much of the discussion is on the pandemic and health care. Biden‚Äôs empathy and willingness to really listen to experts would be such a refreshing change.
Is it me or do all Biden supporters simply ignore everything he has ever said or done? It's like his history is reset daily, he can't do anything wrong. Do any of his supporters know and accept his past?

Very qualified. Plus she‚Äôs no nonsense &amp; feisty.
Have been traveling for several days across Northern New England - lots of Trump/Pence signs. Not one Biden - well one if you count Obama/Biden in Blue Hill ME
She is not qualified. She does not have the stature needed. She is not ready. She is not the right pick. Just: Susan, Rlizabeth, or Kamala. The only exception is Michele but she wouldn‚Äôt take the job,
This dolt doesn‚Äôt understand that Bernie and Biden are working together on policy and pandering for their votes is pointless?
Pure BS. Republicans and you are at fault here. Voting for Biden
DO IT. It would be a major selling point for voters to know what kind of competence and integrity they'll get from Biden's team as opposed to the corruption, nepotism, cronyism, and self-dealing of Trump's.
Big mistake to pick her. Only 3 are qualified: Susan Rice Elizabeth Warren  Kamala Harris. None of the others are qualified to take over if anything happened to Joe
Jill Biden and the smarmy Ed Rendell seem to be running the search anyway
That‚Äôs Joe Biden
Hopefully she‚Äôs not ambitious so Jill Biden won‚Äôt get upset
Some Democrats never learn. Whoever Biden picks is going to be "the most liberal" governor, senator, or whatever. Pelosi's closest confidant. Hillary's best friend. You are not going to win over Republicans by picking someone safe or moderate or inoffensive. So don't even try.
You are correct, Mr. Vice President Pence, Joe Biden is the correct candidate.
is that a threat?  Are you trying to get your MAGA militia ready for a coup? We are ALREADY not safe in Trump‚Äôs America.  Look at what‚Äôs happening in Portland due to Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúMilitia‚Äù. Biden would restore sanity and civility, rule of law and common sense as well as safety.

Nope. Voting for Biden

I'm not sure of that. People who are ride or die for Biden are weeeird. Cult researchers also point out that a cult can grow anywhere, political cults are common (esp during fascism), and that there is a cult for just about everyone that could successfully recruit them.
I may vote for Biden because I am tired of fighting for a country that has no future.. with Biden  at least America will go away and we can all be slaves again.. I am old so I will die before I see the destruction of America that the Dems want and who is left behind  who cares?
I‚Äôve not missed one either, but 2016 left me with two options I resented and it‚Äôs the same this go round. I can‚Äôt believe the clown car of dem candidates shook out Biden as the pick. It could have been worse, but not much.

I don't trust you anymore. You fell for the Corona bull shit hook line and sinker. political expedient perhaps. you don't listen to real doctors on the front line you listen to #Faucithefraud   I am so disappointed in you  so if Biden wins  it is your fault..
Jesus has nothing to do with politics,don't confuse them.Isn't there something about passing judgement in your Bible?You're judging with comments about Biden. You might want to reevaluate who Trump is before you judge Biden,and before you put Trump and Jesus in the same sentence
I just said it‚Äôs not true that Biden wasn‚Äôt accused. I didn‚Äôt say anything about Trump.  Isn‚Äôt it interesting that we are now discussing two old, wealthy men who are running for president and both have had accusations of sexual assault?
O'BUMMER,  divder in chief. Most CORRUPT PRESIDENT OUR GREAT COUNTRY EVER HAD. Such a CLASSLESS person. POLITICIZING BIDEN at a funeral. So sad. KAG üá∫üá∏ üá∫üá∏ üá∫üá∏ üá∫üá∏
That might be true in a legal sense, but he has indeed been accused.
I want to thank the Biden campaign, the delegates and the members of the committee who forged this agreement. What it says, very simply, is that the will of the people must come first.
OMG Mr. President.. you are not falling for the Corona bull shit again?  Maybe we should just let Sleepy, Creepy, Joe Biden become president and accept the inevitable.. America is done.. Stap you balls on Sir or we are fucked. You know it, we all know it.
You might as well just admit right now that you don‚Äôt care if they have to prop up Joe Biden‚Äôs corpse in the Oval, because you‚Äôre happy to be ruled by unelected unaccountable Deep State bureaucrats.
Biden has a 4x greater lead than Hillary did. It‚Äôs not comparable
Hillary‚Äôs 4 point lead is not comparable to Biden‚Äôs 15 point lead. Don‚Äôt forget Hillary still did win that popular vote by like 3 points, so we can expect Biden to lead the popular vote by like what, 12 points? That‚Äôs more than enough to carry over to the electoral college
One of the most, if not the most evil man on the face of the planet today.. Why is it these decrepit  old dead looking creeps don't die?
Most of us left the party completely. There appears to be no way to change it from within. The GOP is rotten to the core now. Thank you for publicly announcing your support of Biden.
Blame would be pointless if Biden loses, because America will become a quasi-DPRK at that point.
But don't vote too early. Biden is very old. He could die and you won't get a second chance to vote.
Mail in voting. Oblubber turns Lewis' funeral into a DNC rally. NO demonrat has condemned the riots. Fat-ass Nadler, et. al., talk over AG Barr. Peelosi calls AG Barr a blob. "Polls" show Biden way ahead (review 2016 election). I'm convinced Trump is ahead and will win, again.
So, the "settle for biden" meme is a joke, but on Twitter it's not a joke? Or it's not amazing the number of people on Twitter who are getting upset about "settle for biden"?
100% correct! I guess Biden &amp; the dnc are against in person voting now? How curious! I'm sure we can provide people with hand sanitizer...it'll be okay. #NeverBiden #DemExit2020  #NeverTrump
Hunter Biden is a nothingburger. When the investigation gets done with your family, they're not going to be enough printed pages to put it all down in one book, it will look like the encyclopedia Britannica.
Good point. That means he also has a lot of the dirt on Biden as well.
John Lewis was a gay man having sexual relations with joe Biden. As a mother of two I don‚Äôt condone this but this makes me like Biden even more. #Biden2020
It's a hostage situation, no doubt. "Vote for Biden or America gets it."  Part of me wants to say "fuck you, I'm not giving you what you want because it's terrible."  Part of me is like "oh shit, they actually DO have a gun to our heads."
For Joe Biden #WeWillVote
European and American interests will best be served by working together to face challenges to their interests. Trump has seriously damaged that cooperation, but the basic needs continue. A Biden administration will do it better, hopefully with a more substantial European voice.
Oh, I'm settling for Biden, but my point still stands.  When 88% are in favor, it's not a compromise, it's a capitulation.  I'm sure wolves are equally happy to keep Americans poor, sick, and dying.
Yeah that's biden footage was way creepier than the stuff you showed Trump doinüôÇ
We‚Äôve had a horrendous four years of Trump. That‚Äôs why I publicly endorsed VP Biden in April.  and  will you stand with me in endorsing Biden for President? #believeinvt #vtpoli
Umm. Maybe this will finally move voters who are giving Trump better ratings on handling the economy than Biden.
Stop Saying Joe Biden Is Ahead. He Isn't.  via
Trump may be trailing but the polls are such that he wins if he gets to -5 and how long can Biden hide his dementia? If Biden manages to do about 5 minutes a week of carefully controlled exposure, he has a chance. If Biden does 1 debate, he is toast.
Trump doesn‚Äôt even try to understand. Voting for Biden.
Count on it! Voting for Biden!
Don‚Äôt do it! Even Bernie is saying vote Biden!!
They aren‚Äôt in mine..and Mia has not committed to Biden... I hope she beats Harris.
Wait, there were people who thought it was connected to the Biden campaign? How stupid are these people?  Believing it's a group of independent centrist-y libs, sure. I think it's safe to assume it's Buttigieg or Warren voters. But the Biden camp? Christ.
Trump: rancid meat Biden: moldy broccoli Third party: burnt pizza None of these: starving Andrew Yang: steak and potatoes with strawberry cheesecake for dessert üòÜ
If by Joe you mean Biden, who do you think will be on the ballot? Trump can't be the only candidate, and everyone else dropped out. But please, tell me who will be on the ballot... I'll wait...
Worth noting that in the popular imagination "anarchist" is almost synonymous with "arsonist". Not that I like the Biden comment but I feel like he doesn't understand or care about anarchism as a belief.
Those "allies" need to sit down, right the [bleep] now. That is utterly sexist, racist bull, and should not be tolerated. This isn't 1950. Women are allowed to have goals, just like men. I recall scheduling Biden to come speak during his presidential run, before he became VP.
Can we focus on supporting the democratic nominee and actually stick together - can we stop republicans chum to use against Joe Biden - thanks.
It's right above you. Did you not see the Biden clip. Oh and hysterically label me a 'trumptard' because that proves you're very intelligent ü•ñ
Not nearly as bad as Biden.
Our point exactly.  Remember when Biden tried to kill Anita Hill‚Äôs career? When he boasted about working with segregationists? When he wrote the crime bill or passed anti-busing laws? His racial jungle comment? When he said Obama was the first well-spoken mainstream POC?  Racist.
Biden won't kill people like the Republicans do so there's that.
Kamala Harris was friends with Beau Biden. I bet he does pick her.
Watch - as soon as Biden announces Harris as his V pick, their narrative will shift to how he was bullied into picking her.
1) Biden has already said he intends one term, and  2) Every VP candidate harbors presidential ambitions.  So get bent, Biden allies.
Biden's too old to be an effective 2-term Pres anyway, he should run &amp; win w/Kamala, declare he'll step aside after 4yrs, have her by his side the entire time so it's clear he'll pass the torch to her, or someone else. If she's doing it right, she'll be in pole position for 2024
Hiw garbage do you have to be to be losing by 30 while Biden, who basically didn't run a campaign, is winning your state by 10 points?
Then along came Bernie and the Democrats needed a familiar face to save them after the group of primary candidates was seen as failing . Biden brought the Obama link with him
Because Biden is as bad as Trump. Right.  How many times are people going to punch themselves in the balls by voting for Republicans?  Biden's not perfect, but if you don't get that he's WAY better than Trump, I don't know what to say. Clearly you'd rather be "right" than win.
Hopefully a President Biden will shelve this. Italy and Belgium send way less money to NATO. And Germany send about as much as we do economy wise. #PutinsPuppet
Keep the poor people out? Hey, don't make me vote biden!
Mr Knight doesn't seem to understand the dangerous moment that is in front of us. If he would rather live with another term for Trump, he doesn't need to take others with him! Do not listen to Ryan! It's life or death situation. Vote Biden!
I am Voting for Biden! Trump can go to either Prison or to Hell!
Joe Biden as a radical leftist. Does not compute.
If he picks someone BECAUSE she/he is black/minority then Biden is a RACIST!
People are listening to you Mr. Trump Jr. !  Keep it up!  Joe Biden is lost!
Lol really? That‚Äôs your plan? To sell Scranton‚Äôs own Joe Biden as a tool of the radical left?  Was this another one of  stupid ideas?
You're listing all of these horrible things.  Good reasons to vote for Biden, all of them.

Biden calls for arrest of ‚Äúanarchists‚Äù because, I guess, he think it‚Äôs a crime to be one. Like Trump. Weird eh?
I voted for  enthusiastically in the primary but now i‚Äôll vote for Joe Biden because Trump is‚Äî
1. Hillary has a lead too. 2. Kaine was a ‚Äúdo no harm pick‚Äù 3. Trump is President.   We don‚Äôt need the ‚Äúdo no harm‚Äù pick. We need the BEST pick and the pick that will actually get people excited. We need   plz so the right thing. #biden #Biden2020 #WarrenForVP
Did Biden endorse jailing anarchists? Wtf
Sanders hard-core supporters are as much a part of a cult as MAGAs.  They will not vote for Biden.
NO way in God's green earth will Trump debate Biden. No way. He'll back out somehow
If Trump wins, we get a dictatorship; if Biden wins, we spend four years battling a right-wing government while trying to prevent another fascist administration in 2024. Jfc
You could keep poking Trump. Every time Biden says something intelligent,you could remind Trump of the stupid things he said.But he'll probably delete his Twitter claiming everyone is being mean
üö®Congressman  has endorsed former Vice President  for President of the United States!   Full endorsement üëâ
Well, Trump will paint Biden as a radical leftist even if Biden says "no more than 5 AR-15s per family," but yeah, good points.
If we're "fortunate" to get Biden, we'll have to spend every minute of the next four years preventing the return of fascism in '24. It ain't going away.
It feels good to have that much faith in those 2 respected leaders that we know Biden is telling the truth. It's who he is.   Such a contrast to the orange shitgibbon &amp; his GOP goons who we know lie at every opportunity. That's who they are.
I love Trump's speeches. Biden's will be such BS. I'll feel like all you damn haters feel about Trump üòó

They knew you would. That's why the put it on air, to control you through your emotions. They have to get Biden in Office and they're willing to do anything to make it happen. Watch out for the big false-flag event coming...
She is great. But not as Biden‚Äôs VP!
They'll do anything to get Biden into office, even if that means killing thousands of innocent people...
True. I won't sleep until after Biden's inauguration.
Bill Barr is a very bad hippo doing very bad things.  Also, happy birthday! I got you a Biden, but you will need to wait a few (excruciating) months, I am always late with gifts.
I will do my part by voting for Biden.
Have you ever heard these people talk?  They will never face reality.  They are not going to vote for Biden.  Not a chance.
That's probably one of the biggest reasons why I cannot vote for Biden.

Same. This year I am voting Biden out of pure desperation. I'm not happy that he's the only viable option though. I don't even have much hope for that! I'm sure I'll get bit in the ass one way or another. If we make it out of this intact I swear I am getting involved politically.
How many people got Covid after your Tulsa rally? Guess Biden actually gives a shit about keeping people safe.
Ask Biden to release what was on #anthonyweinerlaptop for us would ya? What was that file? Oh, insurance policy. Start there friend.

I don't think he is meant to be the savior. He's the one making the mess. I'm watching for someone else to rise. That's why I said I would be watching the elections for a long time to see who rises and keep an eye on it. I doubt it's Biden. Maybe someone close to him though
I believe 2 venues have already pulled out citing concerns of covid. Even if Biden did have an ear piece in I think he would bungle it.
Everyone besides  is üò¥ Both Bass and Rice will be fine choices but no energy. Which is what Trumpers are going after Biden for- we need Harris‚Äôs energy in the VP slot!

Meeeee toooo. And, all Biden supporters should as well!
Before the primary,  organizers &amp; members w/ our partners   &amp;  worked hard to push Biden to commit to #KeepItInTheGround &amp; phase out fossil fuels. Let's keep organizing for our families, our future &amp; all the generations to come.
Seems fair to me. Voting for Biden.
OMG...you can‚Äôt even get that right.  Health care is #1 and leads to jobs and finally getting children back in school safely. Voting for Biden.
This bill is DOA and it should be. What a load of garbage. All that time and THIS is all the #Republicans could come up with? Shameful. #Heals Act demonstrates the  anti-worker stance. They hate us. I'm voting for #Biden and D's all the way down. Dems are TRYING to help.
TrumpHoles are embarrassed, as they should be, so they're lying to the pollsters and saying Biden when they really mean Trump.
You are SO out of touch.  hates us. #COVID is not our fault but I should live on 70% of my already bad salary? You're blowing it, Republicans. Even my father in law is voting for Biden.
Rice steps up for the Biden camp to distract those in the media from getting to close to who will be the VP pick.

Whoo Hoo! Landslide Biden victory! #RepublicansForBiden #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
Riots happen when there is gross injustice and people have lost faith in the system to correct it. Far from ‚Äúseeing more of this‚Äù if Biden wins, this behavior will settle down because faith in the ability of America to self-correct will be somewhat strengthened.
Any scenario in which Trump loses will obviously declared ‚Äúfraudulent‚Äù by the orange clown and his supporters. A landslide victory for Joe Biden will weaken their argument. VOTE!
Not a chance Biden comes out. He is not well.
Scary thinking someone like Joe Biden could be president January 31 Trump responded by banning flights from China source of the virus while Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi thought it was xenophobic

Tough guy threatening unarmed woman. This is trump‚Äôs America. Voting for Biden.
For me, I'm excited about Biden only so far as it levels the playing field some for advocacy. A Biden administration probably wouldn't do everything that I would like but would be more likely hear and incorporate ideas that I care about. I think the unity commissions show that

The more "gear" you wear and stickers you put on your car does not increase the value of your vote. More Biden voters beat less, albeit enthusiastic, Trump voters.
Can‚Äôt handle the truth, eh? Biden, in his own words, destroyed your spoon fed argument about him wanting to ‚Äúdefund the police‚Äù. MAGA can never back up any claims with actual facts. It‚Äôs pathetic how brainwashed you are into believing Trump‚Äôs rhetoric.
I love the fact that true to form you are lining your pockets with republican donor money. Good for you. Less money for your vile campaign. TAKE MORE!! Voting for Biden.
I agree. If elections happen, he‚Äôll be be voted out and he‚Äôll go. My concern: what will he take with him? How much damage will he do in the 78 days before Biden‚Äôs inauguration? We must be vigilant! And vote in huge numbers. Please!

IMO,  is the best candidate at this time. We need boots on the ground ready to repair our relationship with OUR Allies. Let Biden handle OUR Domestic affairs. He's a proven leader.
They may not want Harris for that very reason. She would be in better position to capture the 2024 nomination as Biden's VP if he doesn't run. They may want a "place holder" candidate so the field's wide open in 2024. That ain't Harris.

Your losing big and Biden will win this. You will never be a dictator of this country!
Every American who wants to save their country , their freedoms, and their democracy should vote for Biden, even if they are ultra conservative. Get rid of Trump and regroup in 4 years. Trump is killing this country. WAKE THE HELL UP!

If it were six words, I'd say "You had me at Joe Biden".
Anyone who supported Biden or any of the other candidates who endorsed him during the primary better get on the phone and knock those doors.

No this past four years trumps speaking abilities have significantly decreased. Biden has always had a speaking disability
Trump brought on Criminal Justice Reform which every POTUS, including Obama, promised and never delivered.  Biden is the asshat that gave us the 1994 crime bill which led to mass incarceration of minorities and militarization of our police forces.  Pass.
No, Joe Biden is not a good man, but as a black man you can literally not leave the future &amp; your legacy in the hands of Donald trump for the next 4 years.
Whoever Biden picks needs to be someone who wants to be president. Between a couple of things he's done (biting his wife's finger) and a few things he's said during this campaign I almost think this could be the most important running mate decision in a long time.
You‚Äôre quite delusional in your assessment of Biden‚Äòs accomplishments. None you have listed have made any difference in the lives of every day people. Tax breaks for the rich, the rich pay no taxes. You misinformed, Biden apologist, dunderhead.
I would certainly hope you wouldn't be tweeting at all. Mr. Biden, although I am not a supporter of yours, I will be casting a vote for you. Please do right by the poor, the workers, and the under represented. We will be paying attention.
Joe Biden Makes The Simplest Anti-Trump Promise Ever And People Are Here For It  #SmartNews
Just because they promised to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour in five years, you‚Äôre going to vote for Biden? What about M4A, UBI, student loan forgiveness, you know the important things?
Biden could eat alphabet soup and crap out something smarter than Trump.   Even a can of tuna is more qualified than President Donald Von Clownstick
That statement is a form of fearmongering. Pence should provide examples of why America should be afraid if Biden was President. However at this we have reservations about this current dude looking out for the welfare of the American people.
No problem Walter.I find myself using language I don‚Äôt usually use as a lady when it comes to Trump. He brings out the worst in us all! So ready for our new President Joe Biden.
Wow, it‚Äôs almost like saying Biden is a Trojan Horse candidate ushering in Socialism, while simultaneously saying he‚Äôs part of the Deep State cabal to undermine Trump, isn‚Äôt resonating with his base.
If Trump pounded a much better candidate and had no record the first time, his defeat of Biden will be epic.
I‚Äôll share because the media won‚Äôt. Apparently only certain black lives matter if they can be used by the Biden presidential campaign to slander Trump. Where are the riots for this man?
Lines will be Forming for Joe Biden‚Äôs events if he wins. Unemployment lines, Welfare lines,Food Bank lines, &amp; many more lines that Americans don‚Äôt want to be in.
Or because Trump would absolutely demolish Biden in a debate &amp; doesn‚Äôt want to make a fool out of a man who has dementia &amp; is being used by the dems as a puppet.
This is pretty much how I expected this whole Bernie and Biden thing would go
It was a question, but the fake news CNN already knows this and will stop at nothing to get Biden elected.
He knows the democrats are planning to cheat their way into the WH. Biden has already hired 600 attorneys.
It‚Äôs really sad that this is the only candidate the Democrats could come up with. Joe Biden will never be President!
Racist Joe Biden
Racist Joe Biden
Would it be considered ‚Äúgood trouble‚Äù if the republicans lose ALL POWER (Senate, House and White House) this November, and VP Biden supported the majorities efforts in exposing Trump‚Äôs lies and treachery during his entire presidency by declassifying documents if necessary?
#BidenRepublicans RACIST JOE BIDEN
Biden is as fake as these tweets they keep sending out.
The bar is so fucking low. Just incredible how absolutely awful Biden is and still seen as a Savior.
Anthony Fauci. John Lewis on a bridge!  Little girls next to Joe Biden!
This is exactly why I am dropping my support of Senator Bernie Sanders. He is towing the DNC line. He does not stand for Medicare for all or any of the other issues he championed a year ago. The DNC led by Joe Biden and his policies are something that I cannot get behind. I‚Äôm out
You'll be sorry if BIDEN IS elected !!! ü§¨
Her term end jan 3rd.  And how can you support a racist like joe Biden? Because that is a RACIST quote
Secondly did you hear Biden‚Äôs plan? He rolled his dumb ass out there and said he would do eight things the President has already done to treat Coronavirus. I know liberals love Covid-19 and all, but watch it disappear after Nov. 4th. Trump has done everything the Docs told him to
üòÇüòÇ imagine that a  journalist just advocated that people must vote for #JoeBinden and drive people to vote for Biden.  So much for leaving out your bias Tom, but then again you do work for the  at least your honest üòÇüòÇ
If Biden doesn‚Äôt want to move further left when he needs our votes the most, how are we gonna get him to even consider fighting for M4A, green new deal or any other progressive policies when he‚Äôs in office already? Please enlighten me..
I can‚Äôt help but find it proves the deeply engrained misogyny of American voters that they weren‚Äôt comfortable with Warren as President, but they‚Äôre the most comfortable with her being Biden‚Äôs VP.
Joe Biden, President AND Barack Obama, Vice President ü§î
What's the over-under that  releases this info in October or at some strategic point for Trump?
I don‚Äôt know.  It‚Äôs 50/50.  Biden isn‚Äôt hated the way Hillary is.  If Biden avoids public speaking and debates, he just might win.
Also, everyone who is making this take is telling on themselves. If you think standing up for reinstatement of landmark civil rights legislation from 1965 is the same as a partisan speech for Biden over Trump, well, what's that tell you about your party and your candidate?
Imagine truth, honesty, and decency, . #VoteBlue #TrumpThreatensAmerica #GOPCorruptionOverCountry #Biden
Why didn‚Äôt Biden say this? Biden rolls out and says he would do eight things Trunp has already done. üòÇ
Too bad. Biden wins and takes office 1/20. He‚Äôs out even if he wants to litigate it. The orange shitstain has no idea what‚Äôs in our constitution. He just spews whatever pops in his head
More than 1,000 Hoosiers have claimed Biden yard signs in Indiana so far. More than 8,000 Hoosiers have claimed Trump-Pence yard signs in recent days.
Kick A$$ Mr. Biden,.... Kick A$$!
You sound like an idiot!!! If trump had anything at all on President Obama and Vice President Biden he would have let it out by now. You are right about one thing . The game is over...  for trump!!!
"Seems like we're producing worse-than- mediocre ads for Trump while Trump is producing amazing ads for Biden on his own. Maybe we should look into that."
‚úãWe need another man who possesses the same sense of truth, honesty, and humanity. We're getting Biden because he'll continue to follow in the steps of the best President we had this century.
I remember Biden calling him "clean" and the "first mainstream African American".  He really made an impression on him.
Biden is obviously ‚Äúsavior‚Äù
Final question, with all this power they have, could they swing the vote against Biden or Trump?  If they throw all their weight behind one party and deny the other party use of their services, wouldn't they be able to determine who wins an election?   Pretty scary thought.
The election will be held Votes will be tabulated Electors will be chosen Biden will be elected Biden will be sworn in
WOW! How sad! Guess Fox didn‚Äôt have anything better to do! If this is the worst thing Biden does, we are way ahead of the game! And the fact this is news on Fox shows how you are reaching for stories! Biden May struggle w/Zoom, but you are obviously struggling to find REAL news!
What I love this election cycle: if Joe Biden wins the far left extremists will get shitty when he doesnt do anything. If Trump wins they'll be shitty when he does anything. Honestly though what are cunts going to march for if a Democrat is president lol win:win
1/2 So Biden? Bahaha! Seriously, what if one thing fell on your shoulders even though you had WHO, CDC getting funds to work this shit out? Do you think that is fair? This falls on China, they lied and hid the truth on purpose
Right.... By January 20th, 2021, biden's mental capacity will prevent him from being able to even type, let alone form coherant sentences.
I am voting for Biden, and so is my Mother, two daughters, and friends. Empowering parents is brilliant. Get DeVos out. Vote for a President who has a pandemic plan.
It‚Äôll be nice to see chump gone! But at the same time Biden is not the answer either! #NoMoreBoomersForPresident!
Joe Biden will never be President!
Wanna discusses decline? Look at J Biden
Ashame u say that but cheer on Biden and his racist statements
Vote like your life depends on it. Because it does. Vote Joe Biden.
Biden cant speak in complete sentences, u are correct...he is also a racist

Biden probably won't be around in 20220, either. Haha
I think Biden is just as comfortable as Bill in a Black church. He can't preach like Bill but that's a different discussion.
I'm wondering why Joe Biden didn't speak at John Lewis' funeral. (I didn't see much of it so I don't know if he was even there.)
Are you saying the Biden campaign IS NOT behind these pressers? Couldn‚Äôt pay for better material.
Wow. $2.1M across 300 attendees.   Big numbers for the Biden campaign today.
I haven‚Äôt seen joe Biden in months
I am sure the two times Biden answered a couple of questions he called on reporters from a list with predetermined questions with the answers likely on his teleprompter.
Can you imagine Biden trying to communicate and direct this much content, events, and personal attacks, etc.?
This Corrupt, Unfit, And Now Coward President Has Stated That He Would EASILY Defeat Joe Biden. No CONFIDENT Sitting President Would Postpone An Election.
Watching Obama, and Biden, in any setting, speaking to the American people makes me tear up. I miss having elected officials who know what it is to serve the country. üò≠
Biden saw it coming and put out the warning - I get you don‚Äôt understand, but that‚Äôs what leaders do.
In order for Trump to remain president after losing it wound take a MASS refusal among government actors to ignore Biden‚Äôs legitimacy. And that won‚Äôt happen. They don‚Äôt like him. Justice Roberts could administer the oath in American Deli and Biden will still be the president
üëçüëçüëç.  I‚Äôm still waiting to hear from ANY Democrat how they will STOP the violence, rioting, arson, theft, murders, IF Joe Biden were President! STILL WAITING! Nothing but SILENCE!!!
Trump makes me nervous re: what he‚Äôll do inbetween losing the election and losing power. As soon as Biden takes the oath Trump is very close to the prison cell and he knows it. I maintain that NY state DOJ or US attorney will take him down before US DOJ
The dude can‚Äôt tell the Biden logo is imposed on my pic - his ability to deduce what‚Äôs legitimate is already lacking.
Your family is actively trying to dismantle this country.  Do you actually think we would focus on Hunter Biden and not on the blatant criminal acts coming from the Trump camp?
Plus, some of the age/oratory jokes (while still in poor taste) might actually *land* if Biden‚Äôs opponent were, in contrast, cogent and able to descend a ramp.
I‚Äôm attending Joe Biden for President‚Äôs event, ‚ÄúMoms for Biden Kickoff‚Äù ‚Äì sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe

You already do, Biden‚Äôs a live example for that. He‚Äôs getting dumber and dumber, the closer we get to election date. So yes, we agree
How could anyone vote for Biden #BidenIsAPedophile
No, you don't think, if you did you'd be voting Biden.
Really?  And you don't think Donald Trump commits gaffes, indeed a heck of a lot more than Biden?  This is such a stupid issue for Trump supporters to raise.

Watch for the perp walks and executions. That's plural...  You know, more than one. Many will fall. Oprah, Ellen, Tom, Crissy and John, oh wait it gets better. George Clooney Biden the Clintons and more... It's going to be very satisfying to watch it.
Most racist corrupt fraud in history!  Obummer and his flunkies!  Biden being the gother
You right, Biden doesn‚Äôt have any rallies cause his crowd ain‚Äôt that big. Maybe a broom closet would do.
4 year delay sounds good. Maybe Biden‚Äôs brain can make a comeback
It's in preparation for a mail-in vote that way when Joe Biden wins by a landslide they can say that he was always leading which we know is a lie
Oops...  I'm sure  will gladly accept an endorsement in lieu of an apology
Y'all realize that if Biden wins he's gonna get primary challengers as an incumbent in 2024, right?

The moment President Biden attacks Fox News, Jake Tapper will be one of the first the defend them
Biden has beginning stages of dementia. As a licensed attorney sworn to uphold the law w/ ethics, it is ur obligation to take steps to protect the election process from a candidate who is not qualified to take office or u should be disbarred from  practice of law
And Biden‚Äôs rally is filled with antifa and rioters. There fixed it
yo bro I know you‚Äôre basically a psycho but I don‚Äôt start my new job until next week and I could really use another stimulus check. Get it done and I promise I‚Äôll vote for Biden anyway but I‚Äôll feel really guilty about it.
I'm sorry, isn't aiming for pres after vp literally exactly what Biden did or am I hallucinating
Just saw an email about Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren having a fundraiser tomorrow, on the day that he's scheduled to make his VP pick. Hmmm
MSNBC'S Joy Reid, Rev Al Sharpton &amp; all other "BLACK" Democrats are supporting a "White Prevliged" Senile Old White Man Joe Biden to be their President! Joe Biden longs to be their Massa, even going as far as to say "if you don't vote for Joe Bidden, then you just ain't Black"!
You weren‚Äôt very polite when accusing Biden of peddling an ‚Äúextreme, dangerous conspiracy theory‚Äù that turned out to be true.
I see you‚Äôve been catching a lot of flak here for not being a Biden supporter. Try not to feel too burned.  Just wanted to let you know that I understand why you feel as you do, even if I don‚Äôt agree, I welcome your support of Yang and hope to see you again in 2024.
It's wild how y'all really think everyone is a Russian bot now. That's some tin foil hat paranoia given legitimacy by the media and it's tragic. No I'm American that's why I remember getting lied into Iraq by Biden and co. But sure yep you've got it all figured out
Great, then suspend your Texas campaign. Show us just how confident you are and just know this tweeter is a former lifelong Republican who is voting for Biden to insure you are removed from office before you do any more harm to this great nation.
"This is a continuation of the railroading of President Trump and his administration because Democrats know their candidate, Joe Biden, is also a dumpster fire.‚Äù
No Trump. No Biden.
You will be out of a job once the Biden admin reinstates the FCC Fairness Doctrine. Your lies and dangerous rhetoric should land you in prison.
Had a dream I was set up for an arranged Marriage with Joe Biden. Might this have something to do with the fact that I've been watching both Parks and Rec and Married at First Sight?
I hope you're watching the JL funeral...Biden is supposed to attend....WITH KAMALA!
You went at Jimmy pretty quick with the race card, there, Karen. You think he'd only care because Biden will pick a woman of color as his running mate? How about the fact that Biden is an empathetic human being with basic human decency and isn't the laughing stock of the world?
U are a real killjoy...makes me sick...why even pay attention to all this crap and vote.. for what soooo Biden can win!
If we have in-person voting Trump will win easily if we have a million vote Joe Biden wins in a landslide
As I drive around our country working I see no Joe Biden signs no Joe Biden banners  but the media says he is winning over Trump everywhere all I see are Trump flags and banners are they trying to prepare us for a fraudulent mail-in voting system
Another way to avoid unwanted hair is to avoid being a waitress for Dodd and Kennedy.
Biden (April), "Mark my words he will try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can't be held." Trump‚Äôs response, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs incoherent, conspiracy theory ramblings of a lost candidate out of touch with reality." Trump today, ‚Äúdelay the election‚Äù

Best get used to it- AA‚Äôs supporting Trump, I mean. Biden‚Äôs an admitted racist and anyone who can‚Äôt see it is blind. I work with 6 African-Americans (4 male, 2 female) and 4 of them voted for Trump in ‚Äò16 and all 6 of them say they are going to vote for him this year.
Where does President Trump get his from Biden?  To date, the President has done nothing in an attempt to delay the election.  was right in April and it has aged well. The tweet today does not qualify as a plan and was not even a suggestion is should be done.
you wrote a great article about Bernie vs Biden, and how you knew America wouldn‚Äôt go for Bernie so older black Americans were all in with Biden.  It was before the pandemic swept the country, before George Floyd‚Äôs murder and before America‚Äôs semi awakening or
An F&amp;M poll puts Biden ahead of Trump by 9 points in Pennsylvania.   For context: if Biden wins PA, Trump NEEDS to win Michigan, North Carolina, or Florida.  Biden‚Äôs magic number is 35, which represents the number of electoral votes he needs to flip.
I'm voting for Joe to FIX the mess Trump has made. Fixing the divide in our people will take a while longer.  Biden can honestly give us the background to start healing again.
It's not brilliant, actually. Trump is 100% in control of this race. The swing states where Biden is ahead are because of things Trump does or does not do.  Biden hidin' isn't leadership. It shows he cannot move the needle on the poll numbers. That should be deeply concerning.
Pro-abortion groups have endorsed Joe Biden because his support for abortion is "compassionate."   How have we come to a place where abortion is defined as "compassionate‚Äù?
Joe Biden's VP pick will be the most consequential in history
Not on your life.  Her agenda is politics not America.  She and her party have cost this country millions if not more.  I don't want to delay the election.  I don't want Trump and I don't want Biden.  I think the country is in for one hell of a ride the next four.
Someone's response to "trump floats delaying the election" was "vote for biden!" and I fucking can't
Understand your sentiment but Biden will have to be able to talk and not seem confused....which has happened more recently in any llive situation. Serious question for all voters.
But look at the splash screen title at the bottom: biden takes questions from reporters. Any little thing cnn can do to pump their man along, they do.

One presidential candidate appears to be paying attention #Biden
You kill the illusion like Trump is suggesting, there‚Äôs no going back for a much bigger demographic.  I‚Äôve been pretty certain his advisors are slinking away and I think we‚Äôll see the moderates like Romney endorsing Biden if this keeps up.
Just checked the log, it wasn't Biden either... it was fucking Clinton
Guys, he lost already, we‚Äôre getting Joe. Don‚Äôt even worry about it.   If Bernie or Warren had won this might be a concern but lmao at the powers that be killing the illusion of democracy for Trump over Biden
How is his agenda the ‚Äúradical left‚Äù when Biden is just another republican in democrat clothes, just like 90% of democrats are?
The catastrophic disaster is Donald Trump. He owes Putin Bigley and he is selling America‚Äôs security to pay the bill. If you are a Trump supporter after the Helsinki summit, you are a complete idiot. Real conservatives recognized what was going on. They will support Biden.
See your the true racist , based on that statement. In America we don‚Äôt choose a party, we choose a person. Everyone knows that Biden is incapable of running USA. Based on tour statement you just proved racism still exist. Shame on you
The Lincoln Project are Republicans. They want Republicans in office, just not Trump. Their ONLY goal is to replace Trump with the closest thing to a GOP they could find, Biden.
Yelling at the left about not voting for Biden instead of phone banking those sweet, sweet conservative swing voters y'all think are the key to a Biden victory doesn't seem like an effective tactic. Spoiler: those swing voters either gonna stay home or vote Trump again.

For that matter, let me know when you find any evidence that Biden has made inappropriate sexual comments about his own daughter, as Trump has. Or when 24 women are saying Biden raped or sexually assaulted them, like Trump has.
Now as far as "shouldn't be left alone around children," please let me know when Biden is being sued for raping a 13 year old like Trump was in 2016, or when Biden bragged about deliberately walking in on underage beauty contestants to see them nude.
Trump can't win on policy or leadership. He has neither. He's a blathering idiot who can probably barely tie his own shoes or use the potty on his own. He's losing by a wider margin every day. And you think that pretending that Biden has Trump's problems is a winning strategy. ü§£
Projection of Trump's character flaws onto Biden has been a losing strategy for your bunch from the start, but please keep up the good work of helping Trump lose. ü§£ü§£ü§£
Joe biden in 2020 is the left's version of Mitt Romney in 2012. Many leftists just can't do it, hes either not far enough left for antifa grade communism, or too far left for old time democrats. Very few will be satisfied, or vote. Aww.

DOJ IG rejected claims that the Trump/Russia investigation was corrupt or unfounded.  I mean, most people didn‚Äôt even know it was happening because the Obama DOJ was very scrupulous &amp; stuck to policies.  What‚Äôs Durham going to come up with that‚Äôs going to irreparably harm Biden?
You can say what you want but you clearly disagree with Fox News and the President. You have two choices in this election.  My guess is you either won‚Äôt vote or you‚Äôll vote for Biden. Crazy thing is I voted for Obama in 08. Not my Dad‚Äôs Democratic Party.
If he picks her, it‚Äôs a clear signal that he has no real remorse for his Crime Bill vote. She‚Äôs a cop.

Trump and Biden have a deal for a BRIBE: Trump will lift sanctions on Russia; Putin will enrich Trump. Everything Trump does for Putin, such as ignoring Russia's paying bounties for killing Americans, is explained explained by this  one fact.
Biden does right?
I've had enough from the contingency that says they are not going to vote if Biden doesn't pick their fav for VP. GET OVER IT! Do you want 4 more years of trump?
So much for your lies defending Biden lol. We are sick of your leftwing bullshit and lies when we actually can hear for ourselves what is being said. You and your buddy Brad can revel in your ignorance, but the rest of us are not sheep to be fleeced as easily as you are.
Agreed. If Biden wins can you me and Liz go get like extremely drunk and yell to the world how awesome our future is?
Biden is going down, one debate and it is over. Will be hard to hide his incompetence on live TV. No way to sugarcoat it.
Don‚Äôt be an idiot professor.  The President completely understands and knows it is not a ‚Äúfee‚Äù, but Germany is not meeting its obligations.  By the by, just as many Biden voters don‚Äôt understand the inner workings of NATO.  Also to be expected.
Likewise, it should be repeated often that PROGRESSIVES OWE NOTHING TO BIDEN OR THE DNC!  The fact that Biden cannot defeat Trump aside, We Progressives owe no allegiance to a Democratic Party that looks, acts, and smells Republican!
Is this an instance of some sort of weird projection? Have you seen Biden on his rare visits aboveground? The man is clearly sundowning. He often doesn't know where the hell he is or what the topic is or what the question was. Good grief.
Isn‚Äôt the point that the Federal Government shouldn‚Äôt dictate local zoning against the wishes of a state or city?    IE. the Biden/Sanders/Booker plan to start enforcing Obama‚Äôs Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing initiative.

Democracy was on the line when you were trusted to choose our future over the post-capitalist authoritarianism of Mike Bloomberg and Joe Biden. You chose the later. I believed in you, by the way. You, not Bernie, were my political hero. Thank you for proving how wrong I was.

It would KILL Trump if he can‚Äôt follow Biden around the stage like a crazy stalker.

Who‚Äôd I call a racist? And not touting Biden either, but Trump is our worst president by far and for a multitude of reasons. End of story.
And if you‚Äôd like to compare him to say Bernie, who is a true lefty, here ya go:
And here is a useful timeline of his life and career.

Another bold stand by Rep. Rashida Tlaib.  We Progressives owe NOTHING to Biden, the product of a corrupt DNC which has backstabbed and betrayed We The People.  We most certainly need more Representatives &amp; Senators like her!

This is how people are treated by love ones, when they have something to hide. Biden is not  Hiding .  That would imply he knows were he is, or where hes going.

Hmmm I didn‚Äôt know that you could decide for all of us ... Problem is Democrats have lost the middle ... I‚Äôm part of that middle ... I don‚Äôt know of anyone voting for Biden ... Joe doesn‚Äôt even know where he‚Äôs at ... btw where was his mask ...
The two big objections to Harris in Biden's circle seems to be that she's too ambitious, and that she's a ruthless political operator. Because Heaven forbid we should have one of THOSE in the Democratic party.
This judge has been wrong several times now. What‚Äôs going on here. Does he have Biden disease?
More to the point, the job of this VP, even more than others, is to become president if/when Biden's health fails. Ambition for the Oval is a key component of the job description.

Yup, sucks that Biden is so racist too
Listen to the scientific evidence. Biden is lucid and in a daydream of dementia.
Also a complete lack of awareness since Biden will be ancient in 2024 and should absolutely step aside if he's even able to run in the first place.

No this isn‚Äôt a both sides thing. Joe Biden has always been a decent man.
Oh you mean EXACTLY WHAT YOU DO?? The difference btn Biden &amp; you is he cares about ALL Americans, not just those who are in his political party! Only POTUS who consciously does what he can to divide our country! November can't come fast enough..can't wait till you are gone!
Best neighbors I could ever have: Hispanic, Korean, Slovakian, Chinese, Black, White, Indian, Irish, and more. All awesome  AMERICAN Neighbors! YOU DO NOT REPRESENT ME! YOUR ‚Äúnews‚Äù disgusts me! YES I‚ÄôM VOTING FOR BIDEN!
You know how Biden is a sex predator so the DNC is silent about Trump being a sex predator? You know how Biden "won" the primaries with voter suppression and exit poll discrepancies? So....
Doesn‚Äôt have what it takes to be VP but will definitely have a spot in Biden‚Äôs administration.
Authors Claim In New Book That Obama, Biden Operatives Had Financial Ties to Russia
Biden is a genius compared to Trump, who is easily the dumbest person ever elected president  EXHIBIT B
Biden needn't spend a dime campaigning. Just let Trump do as many interviews as he can.
This Biden strategy of just working behind the scenes and letting Trump make a bigger ass of himself every day is actually brilliant.  #Trump2020
Trump will endorse social distancing to avoid debating the obviously superior speaker Joe Biden.
If Biden wins and we win the senate, can you guys start a social media drive to have Biden pick President Obama for his first SCOTUS choice?  The poetic justice would be reason enough.
This move has no backing from the American people. This is COMRADE Trump at work. Our new ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù President, Joe Biden will have to right this wrong on his first day in office.
Joe Biden do you care to tell America about your son's partner or should I do it  do you also care to tell them  how much he made under the table bribing Ukraine
I totally disagree with this move. President Biden will have to send them back on day 1. He‚Äôs definitely going to have much work to do that day.
Biden has dementia, his shuffling walk, confused speech, someone constantly leading him or telling him what to say. This is the Democrat candidate for the Presidency! They‚Äôre all looney!
President Trump is painting a dystopian portrait of what Joe Biden‚Äôs America might look like, asserting crime and chaos would ravage communities should the former vice president win the White House in November.
would the VP selection for Biden influence in any way the polling in swing states? #askPOLITICO thank you.
I sure hope when Joe Biden becomes President he need the trump regime a terrorist group.
Joe Biden is a delusional lunatic!!!
I wouldnt vote for Joe Biden if he was the last man on earth. Trump2020!!!
"She's settling...for Biden?"
Young voters r not aware of Biden‚Äôs absolutely horrid n racist history..n the way he touches children makes gag.. he will never lead anything if u uneducated voters happen to put that weak brain in office..he  set up his son.. sister..brother..n himself up from Ukraine n China $$
Actually, freedom of religion means freedom from government control of religion, unlike Biden wanting to force studies of Islam upon schools, or numerous dems being radical islamists, or the numerous democrats who are extreme anti-Semites trying to force their views upon others
Biden couldn‚Äôt challenge my cat! Go Trump!! Actually Biden can recall the fibs from outright lies he has told..u people put him n he will never run this country 1 day..all the country haters will do that..starting with the laughable AOC.. she wants ur gasoline gone! N high taxes
Joe Biden expected to select running mate next week
Hey, I made no statements about my political affiliation or what I think of Biden. I said masks are important, and that he wasn't wearing one because it was February. That's a fact, not an opinion.
Biden expected to choose running mate next week
Police protecting human life is not Biden‚Äôs focus
Remember when we all had a meeting and decided Joe Biden would be the best person for the job?  I don‚Äôt remember either.

Watching Vice President Biden Eulogizes Senator Byrd
For context: if Trump lost Michigan and also lost Pennsylvania, Biden wins the election.   Biden needs to flip 35 electoral votes. Michigan is 16. Pennsylvania is 20.
Tell me you‚Äôre not a vote blue no matter who. Dems are just as complicit in all of this. Nothing will fundamentally change with Biden.
Probably the reason #Biden is picking #KamalaHarris over #SusanRice. #USABash will "unmask" Rice &amp; a few dozen others.

For those of you having trouble understanding why Biden's statement is a problem, just imagine how you'd feel if he said you should be arrested for brunching or golfing or watching network sitcoms.
I believe the Arabic text says, "Biden-bin-Lyin is an idiot.  Elect him if you are for Sharia law. We have this cat in our pocket. Allah Akhbar."
We all are, but it's not going to happen. The Dems will keep America shut down &amp; #Biden in the basement to avoid it.

Wait, are you implying Biden is in charge right now? He's the one overseeing the country eat itself apart? Or is it Trump fueling the protests with secret police and tear gassing people for photo ops? How deluded you have to be to think Biden has played any role in where this is
Not even funny anymore.  It may work against Pres Trump, but I dont think Biden is fit to serve as POTUS. A new candidate is needed by the left.
Biden‚Äôs notes on very simple concepts and ideas - good;  briefing notes on complex foreign and domestic issues - bad
those polls are fake.  There is a lot of negative stuff circulating about Joe Biden and his agenda.  The Dems can‚Äôt even decide on a platform.
A couple snapshots from the CBS News/YouGov Poll (July 21-24):  via
Yeah? Biden is less garbage? The dude can barely even put a sentence together. Truly ask yourself why you hate trump. He is NOT racist. He is trying to save this country. Please please stop listening to cnn. Trump not the bad guy they say he is. That's what you've been led to see
Two choices: Biden and open borders, Medicare for all including undocumented immigrants,  Federal government coopting State's Rights,  control of residents rights, assault on the US Constitution,  higher taxes across the board OR President Trump,  putting America First. CHOOSE.
is refusing to endorse Biden. She‚Äôs a detriment to the Democratic Party and not just because she won‚Äôt endorse Biden. I lost all respect for her when she led the booing toward Hillary Clinton on whose shoulders she stands.
Before you make a final decision on a running mate next week, please don't forget     #Biden2020 #Biden
Exactly. In her own words, ‚Äúme and Joe Biden should not be in the same party‚Äù. Meanwhile, well-meaning leftists attacking her for that very same reason as if she personally has any say. It isn‚Äôt like the DNC doesn‚Äôt primary every leftist everywhere every chance they get.
I agree.  Don't worry, I'm a Biden voter no matter what.  My comment was intended as humor since both Palin and Quayle were republicans.  Biden will pick a sane running mate.  (I'm hoping for Rice.)
Hahaha Axelrod blocked me? For what? I didn‚Äôt even know I followed the little guy. Was it because I retweeted that video yesterday? Yes I get it not the most credible thing but I ain‚Äôt a Trumper or a Biden guy. Just a dude trying to stay objective. #soft
And yet you say nothing about RACIST Joe Biden?  Stop being partisan and do what is RIGHT for a change.  Pocahontas is exactly why we need #TermLimits
I am making an augment living in a non-swing state your chances winning Mega millions is better than effecting the outcome of a presidential election. **it has a technical name that escapes me at the moment**  Dan Slott, you are better than Joe Biden.
If Biden picks a Palin or a Quayle as a running mate I'm moving to Canada.  Otherwise it's #Biden2020 all the way.
First Biden has to win.  Vote Biden!
Biden Coy About VP Pick, Meeting With Them In Person
You are the anarchist! That‚Äôs why tru conservatives, like me, are voting for Biden.
That is a the most hilarious thing I have heard in a long time. Clearly you were just a child and didn‚Äôt have to pay bills back then. Thankfully President Trump brought us back from eight years of Obama and Biden.
THIS IS KIDNAPPING! America is dying and Donald Trump is the murderer of democracy. Please for all things you love about this country, vote for Joe Biden. America is better than this. I'm terribly sad :(
We're less than 100 days away from the election and Joe Biden ain't said shit. Ain't aired a commercial. Ain't picked a VP candidate and this the guy y'all chose to run your country? Put it together, you fuckers are just biden' your time.
If it‚Äôs not Stacey then Biden‚Äôs a racist.
Biden vows to battle racial inequality with economic agenda
So you don‚Äôt even know?  I‚Äôll tell you what it is -  ‚ÄúNothing will fundamentally change‚Äù joe Biden   ....are you a dual citizen or are you now considered a foreigner interfering in American politics?
When Joe Biden blow up in people‚Äôs faces you can say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt blame me I voted third party.‚Äù
Ashley - they‚Äôre warped.  The democrats are 1980s republicans now.  Biden gets in, I guarantee America goes to war.  It‚Äôs pathetic, yet predictable.
Oh, and in this one, he just deleted a tweet insinuating that the debate at Notre Dame had been canceled as a conspiracy to help Joe Biden:
This would be the same method used if there is a presidential debate... Somehow never let Trump get a word in, between biden mumbling random dribble and the leftist moderator covering for him.
Joe Biden is a joke, but he's still better than Drumpf the Traitor .
Yeah, hiding in the basement and refusing to talk. That‚Äôs LEADERSHIP at its best. LOL. To be clear, I‚Äôm not defending Trump at all. I‚Äôm completely shitting on Biden.
To my Twitter followers: who do you think Biden will select as his VP?
And voting for Biden will change it?...are u high
üö®This is just more of an example that Biden is not running his campaign. Nor will he run his presidency he if wins.They even put words in his mouth about what he thinks of his choice.  Well done puppet masters.

I‚Äôm an anarchist. I had planned to vote for Joe Biden. Now that I know he wants to make me a political prisoner, I will not.
To vote against Biden, I would need another, viable, alternative to trump. Having met trump and lived through near 4 years of his "leadership" there is no circumstance in which he could earn my vote.
Lmao damn Joe Biden and trump are.... Yes the same.
But... this is literally America right now.  Under President Trump.    Joe Biden's not in charge of anything or any decision making...
Thank you we will remember that on November 3rd.   Joe Biden 2020!!!
No, we are hell bent on changing the reason why Trump was elected to start with. Hillary lost because she was a shitty candidate, people aren't voting for Biden this time because he's exciting them, they are voting for him because Trump scares them.
Wrong! Biden isn't president.  This is America under Trump. These are not peaceful!  I'm sure Trump's base isn't that stupid. Biden isn't in office.
How am I being rude? Biden is pandering over supposed ‚Äúincome inequality‚Äù. It is not inequality when women choose work that doesn‚Äôt pay the same, don‚Äôt work the same hours, and other things that women freely choose. If you don‚Äôt know those things, then you aren‚Äôt smart.
Coherent would be anyone but Joe Biden
That‚Äôs cool, but as a 30 year Senator Biden won‚Äôt need much help moving domestic policy. He still has relationships in the Senate.
Vote for Biden, unless you like a president who lies for his benefit at the cost of your lives.
Stupid prediction: Biden/Harris is going to win like 350 Electoral Votes if COVID doesn‚Äôt drastically improve by October
Accusations come out of the walls for politics.  What about Biden's sexual assault.  She seemed credible, but one always wonder at how convenient these accusations come out. Don't put all your eggs in this one.
I don‚Äôt like a Biden/Harris ticket but that‚Äôs the best possible result of ‚ÄúJoe Biden VP search‚Äù that was anywhere close to reality
He wasn‚Äôt picking anyone to the left of her and it‚Äôs much better than a mayor with limited national pub or Amy Klobuchar. He wasn‚Äôt going further left than Harris either. So for Biden it‚Äôs the best possible pick
Well, it‚Äôs the right call for Biden honestly

So true Me President. I‚Äôm sitting here watching Joe Biden read answers to pre determined questions as he selects pre determined reporters from a list of people who submitted their questions prior to this press conference. This isn‚Äôt a press conference. üòÇ
Yet nothing about the Obama/Biden DOJ/FBI illegal activities.
Watching Biden's "Press Conference" Obviously staged. He has a list of media and is calling "them" to ask questions, nothing random about it.
All I know is I‚Äôm sitting here watching Joe Biden answer pre determined questions with written answers from pre determined reporters. This doesn‚Äôt count as a press conference.
The Attorney General testified before the House Judiciary Committee, today. Joe Biden detailed a proposal to advance racial equity in the country, and a psychologist explains how the covid death toll can dull our collective outrage.   begins now on 90.1!

FWIW, here are my reasons to give Biden my vote this year; he'll likely:  1) respect allies / resist dictators  2) make competent appointments, then let them do their work  3) conduct himself in a conciliatory way; not start relational forest fires  4) less hate in immigration(?)

Yang's been a lifelong democrat, he hates Trump, and always had nice things to say about Joe personally on the campaign trail. With all those things under consideration, I don't think anything's really out of the ordinary the way Yang tries to support Biden
I've thought the same thing. He could be easily 10 points ahead of Biden and coasting into getting re-elected IF he had just followed basic advice.
The ironic "Integralists for Joe Biden" meme is cynical entertainment for the terminally online
You think those people support Biden? Go ask them, if you‚Äôre not too scared.
A presidential candidate has declared that he will force Americans to fund Planned Parenthood. This would undo a litany of reforms put in place by the Trump Administration.   We cannot lose the progress we have made to protect life.
The DNC is really fumbling it right now. I‚Äôll still vote for Biden but after this election I don‚Äôt think I can support the party anymore.
A bit more nuanced than that. It comes down to strategy. Dem leadership are trying to create Trump/Biden voters. And they don‚Äôt want to hit Trump too hard, fearing that people who could switch would just double down on Trump. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make them feel bad for voting for him in ‚Äò16.‚Äù
Notre Dame cancelling the debate at their location. Will that be a trend so debates become virtual so Biden can have someone whispering the answers? COVID gives Biden operatives better cover to keep him hidden.

Until the election. Biden wins the narrative changes and not as bad. Trump wins narrative also changes to impeachment over the handling
Days or weeks later, are you kidding?  Many places are doing mail-in voting in addition to absentee voting (due to an excuse) We could be months waiting on tally's. Surely there's another ACORN out there to suddenly FIND just the right number of votes to give Biden needed votes.
Democrats are now trying to eliminate the Presidential Debates. Is it because Biden can‚Äôt speak in complete sentences?? Democrats want things shut down so people can‚Äôt go to polling sites and instead use mail in votes. Is this so they can FRAUD our election??

Joe Biden has more strength, intelligence, integrity and morals in his pinky finger than you could ever wish for!Your lies about Joe only shows YOUR DESPERATION because Joe is massively polling double digits across the country ESPECIALLY MICH., Pennsylvania, WISCONSIN AND FLORIDA
is going to lose the election. The people around him lie. We will throw him out of the WH and Biden will tear down the embarrassing WH wall. Never, in American history has a pres* walled himself in because he is afraid of the people.
Media: Biden is double digits up in every major poll.  Trump:
No he doesn't. Biden is leading by double digits and folks are still saying he needs a choice that will energize the far left in the party.
I think this media fueled "buzz" for Karen Bass is bull sh*t. I'm a political junkie yet had to google who Bass was. THAT's a problem. This reeks of being a weak VP selection who'd be a place holder if Biden doesn't run again leading to a jungle primary.

Karen Bass is a good choice. So are all of the other candidates Joe's vetting. If the VP pick turns you off Biden, you were never going to vote for him in the first place.

Joe Biden will never be President
This is the first point on Biden's health care page. Saying that mainstream Dems don't want to "open Medicare to every single person" borders on lying.  All this nonsense infighting does is help Trump.
Marxist Angela Davis backs Biden. Why? B/c he‚Äôs a 'candidate who can be most effectively pressured'. In other words..he‚Äôs a puppet. So he‚Äôs an honest &amp; decent guy. Ok great. But remember..Biden will usher in a irreversible societal change. As a republican,surely you can see this?
What "so kind".."so decent" is that what is needed if Biden doesn't finish his term? I want a VP that is a leader and can step in at a moment's notice.

Another great reason NOT to vote for Biden ‚Äî he‚Äôs owned by the lib teacher unions who want government to make the decisions re your child‚Äôs education. Teachers unions will demand Biden eliminate charter schools ‚Äî rollover-for-a-vote Joe will acquise to their demands. #Trump2020
Is he? How do you know? Does anyone really know? Does media actually report on it accurately? I think your instincts on DT are probably correct. I‚Äôm not going to argue with you about that. But again, you‚Äôre making a bad deal if you think Biden is a good alternative.
Hillary SUPPORTS Racist Joe Biden!
Joe Biden is a racist.  Are you saying you agree with his racist remarks?
I don‚Äôt disagree. He‚Äôs not a conservative. Not in the classic sense at all. But Biden and the Democrats are not Americas savior.
Hahaha biden is going to win.  A dying old man who can't remember where he lives is going to be your president hahahaha
Biden's 1977 statement that the right tries to use has been debunked. Repeatedly.
I don't think Biden will win, but, like I said, I agree it's a dangerous path.  I still think it's necessary at this point because it's gotten too far out of hand already.
Well, I‚Äôm not interested in throwing mud on anyone. You don‚Äôt know what you don‚Äôt know. Look at the whole, complete picture. Electing Biden comes with baggage. You get a package deal. You get AOC, Bernie Sanders, Stacy Abrams, Pelosi, Schumer and their whole agenda.
Well, to be sure I‚Äôm no Trump fanatic. But I think you‚Äôre deluded if you think Biden is some kind of angel.
Notre Dame giving Joe Biden a way to duck  for a debate
The University of Notre Dame has withdrawn as host of the first presidential debate between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden.
It will be after January 2021.  How much damage you do between November and January will really determine how much more work Biden will have to do. You will utterly destroy this country even more than the prior 3 years if that is possible.
I seriously doubt Biden‚Äôs handlers will follow through
I don‚Äôt care if the polls have Biden up by 172% and everybody gets a turkey club sandwich. Vote vote vote vote vote.
I appreciate the sentiment, Pete. But that day is going to be a dark day no matter who wins. Our country is too divided, and the rhetoric has run too hot. Joe Biden just means we can spend 2021 trying to heal our country. But either way, November will be a dangerous month.
Trump should go on the Joe Rogan show and force Biden to something similar and come out of his basement to do interviews and debates.
There is only one person who is the most qualified in experience, savvy, heart, integrity, tenacity, and leadership skills necessary to be the Democratic VP pick. That is Kamala Harris. Not selecting her will be a severe detriment to the country and the Biden campaign.

Ari, did you ask her abt ANY of these issues during that interview? Or are you just dragging her now before Biden choses his running mate? #thebeat
Duh! Biden won‚Äôt debate.
That's why the other candidates closed rank as quick as they did around Biden. They weren't going 2 let her campaign divide us  As  rises 2 power, I hope she does not take this track. She is a bright, strong, articulate woman, but I worry she's cut right from Bernie's cloth.
Andrew Bates, I would like to ask you if you could plead with Mr. Biden in reference to our BLM protesters. If he could ask them to go home for awhile and then maybe trumps goon would stop hurting us. Please I am pleading here.
Biden's team better understand that America will not accept a debate-less election.  Cowardice - hiding - will not win you OH, PA, WI or MI. If Biden doesn't debate, he loses the Mid-West.
Fair enough. So, not to change the topic, but do you think Joe Biden should be going out and filling up gyms and auditoriums and stadiums with people at rallies? What is the appropriate way to campaign? After Tulsa, Trump/Pence isn't doing much more than media appearances.
Hello, my name is Melanie Harvey and I am pleading with you ty o get Mr. Biden to ask our protestors to stop for a while so trump's mitilia will stop hurting us please I am pleading with you

This is the worst possible pick for Biden, and it has nothing to do with Susan Rice personally, or what she would bring to an administration.  Trump‚Äôs base hates her.  We cannot afford to fuck this up with something this obvious.

Dude..., what world do you live in? Open your eyes and get off of Twitter. Biden stands 0 chance.
So much of the analysis of the 2016 election is unread of what actually happened in 2016. Trump won Michigan by 10k votes....that‚Äôs **nothing**....people decided not to vote or that Trump wasn‚Äôt gone win anyway. Add into that, misogyny. Biden can win
oh my, lets panic. They don't want a war anymore than we do.  They are gonna wait, hoping Biden gets in.  if that happens, Biden will voluntarily offer up our intellectual property.  Increase job loss for USA.
Joe Biden should have a part of his transition team that is completely dedicated to commutation and pardons so on the very first day thousands are released from prison. He‚Äôs 100 mf years old, nothing to lose. It‚Äôs time for big gestures like come tf on

I don't care about your stupid rose garden, you won't be around to enjoy it anyway, and 1st Lady Dr Jill biden will make it much better
It‚Äôs Michigan. She represents the state in Congress. She is using her platform to stay neutral when we need her the most. It was only decided by 1% in 2016, small decisions like her‚Äôs not to endorse Joe could make the difference between a Biden win and another 4 years of fascism.
This is not the reason why they won't host. A debate can be done safely. They have to keep Biden from the public until November 3rd.
Check out the neoliberals. Will one be Biden's running mate?

Joe Biden is the fucking nominee and ‚Äúthe left‚Äù will go out in droves to vote for his centrist ass but douchebags like this will say dumb shit to frame this situation as ‚Äúthe left‚Äù causing a fracture between themselves and centrists.
And, Dr. Biden will very likely undo any of the trashiness that Melania brings to her "revamping" in an effort to put her "mark" on the White House.
If Biden wins in November you probably will sleep peacefully... unfortunately for eternity.

VP Biden you haven't said a thing on social security what are going to do for seniors? A 1.5% raise is just not enough for seniors
Not knowing how much Biden has accomplished and just repeating the GOP line shows you‚Äôre a low-info voter. You‚Äôre better off with Trump if you need someone to tell you how to think.
Everything you believe is untrue
Bernie/Biden had a debate with no audience, they'll happen maybe with no audience or need to covid test/quarantine audience.

Turnout up and Biden wins with +4 and they‚Äôll still say he‚Äôs not Liberal Enough to get Bernie voters.
The biggest story in decades is the Trump administration ignoring the fact that Putin has put a bounty on the heads of American soldiers in Afghanistan!!!!  When Biden takes over in January you will go to prison for treason!!!
"How to Blow a 3-0 Lead in the Playoffs: The Joe Biden Story"
Agreed!  But don't count on it.  Remember 2016.  Then keep in mind the DNC chicanery of this year.  All it takes to give away our landslide is for the presumptive Candidate Biden to choose a nasty running mate.  As for Congress, WE CAN SANITIZE THAT SENATE AND CLEAN THAT HOUSE!
It's real nice of Melania to  get the garden all spruced up for Joe Biden and his wife to enjoy.  ü§†ü§ØRight now, the soon to be First Lady, is planning to have sunflowers planted. This way, they have a natural way to feed the birds.

God willing, the damage can be contained until we get Biden in the WH. We'll see you in 2024!!
Biden has literally never been a corporatist--he's been pro labor his entire career
Joe Biden can barely make it through one let alone two sentences without rambling on to something else. His mind ain't there no more. So you have three people running for president who got mental problems.
Biden's entire healthcare plan is centered on allowing everyone to enroll in Medicare or an equivalent. And I agree with you about marijuana--that's why I'm supporting Biden over Trump.

is the only logical choice. If Biden actually wants both Progressives AND a chance at winning over the black vote, she's the realest deal there is, bar none.
Ther is no way anyone with a serious concern for the future of our democracy can support the fascist presidency of Donald Trump. Former lifelong Republicans are tired of this dumpster fire and we are tired of idiots like you promoting him. I‚Äôm voting for Biden in November.

Hey Biden, when do you plan on passing?
Aug 17th? Tho Biden has previously said he was shooting for a reveal by Aug 1?  So hopefully soon.
Well, a lot of young Democrats are starting to realize that Joe Biden is a senile kiddie diddler so I'd actually be planning on another four years of Trump.
Just remembered that I'm gonna have to sit through Trump-Biden debates.   Can't wait.
Before you vote, ask yourself this one question: who is the liar? Trump or Biden?
This former lifelong Republican will be enthusiastically supporting Biden. I am also looking forward to voting my GOP senators out of office. How do you like that enthusiasm?
If I were one of Joe Biden's media handlers, I would secure him incommunicado in a windowless room until the day after election day. His wife &amp; sister would be his only contacts with the outside world. They're all the same to him.
One of the many reasons NOT to vote for Biden is the simple fact his corrupt dealings with foreign nations for financial enrichment of the Biden family makes him vulnerable to blackmail. Biden will be forced to acquiesce to demands or be exposed. #VoteRED2020 #VoteTrump2020
Didnt Biden say he was in support of increasing police funding?
I hope so, for I now fear that even if it‚Äôs a landslide, at least six states flipping and Biden wins by 10M+, Trump has tasted that he can deploy a paramilitary. I could see him forcing key states to declare the elections as tainted, easier done with  governors.
When Biden is president he won‚Äôt harass us with Twitter hissy fits.

You are hateful and sick for implying Biden might feel that way without evidence. Biden may be a douchenozzle, but so are you for this despicable implication.
You're spot on about Biden being more liked and respected across the political spectrum. I don't remember Hillary having a bunch of Repubs and former Repubs advocating for her and the Dems. It's not just the Lincoln Project.
You have no credibility caping for Joe Biden while talking about the "ball and chain" on your ass.  Hold Democrats accountable for once.  Maybe they will try to earn your vote instead of simply expecting it.  Blacks people are the Democrat side pieces.

It wasn‚Äôt just conservative politicians  he disliked. He hated it all. Yes, liberals too. The wool being pulled over the eyes of the voting populace to give them the illusion of choice.  That‚Äôs why the other Dem noms coalesced around Biden on ST.  To keep the status quo.

This had to be the dumbest meme I have ever seen, man. I mean, even if it was directed towards Biden...I'd still say the same thing. But I've only seen liberals post things this stupid, so...Well at the very least if ppl have concerns about Trump's background, they certainly should be very concerned about Biden's inconsistent and sketchy history.
First, everyone can have and express their opinion, even if others don‚Äôt like it. I disagree with Rendell but it‚Äôs his opinion. Second, Biden‚Äôs VP is more than just a VP due to his age and 1 term promis. Third, timing of announcement is important, he shouldn‚Äôt take it lightly.

What‚Äôs funny is that he thinks we care what he has to say. Last time I checked, there are credible allegations  that Obama, Biden, and his administration committed treason.
China is the biggest threat to America and the rest of the world. As Dems continue to pander to the #CCP, they nominate a puppet. Biden has proven to be weak on all fronts: mind, body, policy, leadership, and China. America needs
With the left controlling the MSM and many cities and states, some hallmarks of communism are already quite evident. Imagine consolidating that power in the Biden puppeteers. #Trump2020
He‚Äôs as bad as Biden!
Joe Biden, April 23: "Mark my words: I think he is going to try to kick back the election somehow; come up with some rationale why it can't be held."  President Trump, April 27: "I never even thought of changing the date of the election. Why would I do that?"   July 30:
Biden is 78. Any VP he picks needs to start preparing to become president the moment she is chosen. That‚Äôs in fact the more important of the VP‚Äôs two constitutionally mandated jobs. The other is to preside over the Senate.

Obama and Biden was smart enough!
Biden is also a pervert!
It's not clear what Biden meant, and it's his obligation as somebody trying to be the leader of a global superpower with thermonuclear weapons to be INCREDIBLY clear in his communications.
We'd better get on the ppl who have to organize the huge undertaking of absentee balloting first so we can make Biden happen.üá∫üá∏
If they "infamously pull low numbers for Biden" that wouldn't mean the trajectory wasn't useful. If the "real" shift is B+60 to B+53, a poll that consistently showed low for Biden might show something like B+52 to B+46
Democrats got in a tizzy about big donors and cooperate sponsors; what they don‚Äôt want you to know: big tech and liberal controlled media propagate division and disinformation to keep the Biden campaign alive. #Trump2020
Anyone else thinking that we will be better if Joe Biden is elected because his opponents won't torch America?
Joe Biden your top pick for your VP pick is waiting to hear her name and as well as her excitement I‚Äôm sure you can‚Äôt wait! But not so sure if your wife Jill is ready for her!
Everyone knows that protesters/rioters/looters are immune. Yet the President is right. Most of the country is free from that imaginary virus.  At least the pandemic part is imaginary.  It will go away with Joe Biden after the election.
Joe Biden doesn't remember what he had for breakfast.  I suspect the intent was "arsonists and vandals", which would be consistent with references to criminal damage.  I really wouldn't read much into it. I've talked to family members with dementia who still thought it was 1942.

Who do you predict will be Joe Biden's running mate?
Oh its real alright
Biden you stand right in front of these people and tell them you don‚Äôt lie to them, that‚Äôs a bare face lie!

Biden  you need to quit using God‚Äòs name in vain, you idiot you must be Pelosi brother!
Biden the local police is getting killed they can‚Äôt take cate of it you Phucking idiot!
Sanders has done a lot. But his gaslighting to his supporters is appalling. You can encourage the electorate to vote Trump out because Sanders sees the dangers likened to the ones that his Jewish family had suffered. But don‚Äôt lie about Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúprogressivesness‚Äù.

You're free to do what you want and I'm free to make fun of it and vice versa. With that being said, it would seem that Biden is currently leading so I'm not sure about that victory, much less a landslide, but I can understand why you would want to remain delusional.
Also heard that if Biden is elected aliens will steer asteroids towards America. Also heard that the Dems will cause super volcanoes to erupt leveling cities with liquid magma. Also rumors that only you can protect the sun from exploding sending us to a cold dark icy death. #MAGA
Biden is not able to do an unscripted interview.
Joe Biden, you best bet is to pick Harris Kampala Harris she‚Äôll take care of ya!
Which is the dumber Biden campaign platform?
I'm seeing all of the same liberal tactics from the 2016 election used again to encourage people to vote for Biden and just...  Why do you think that will work this time?
Biden may be in it for four years to clean up the damage and then pave the way for the next person. Trust the process.
Think we still will be counting ballots (for a while). Even if overwhelmingly in favor of Biden. Challenges, challenges, challenges.
All Biden needs to do is promise to return the #PeoplesHouse to the American People.
Hating Trump is common on both sides and i know a few republicans that absolutely despise him but are still going to vote for him because fuck Biden and fuck neoliberals  Which is hilarious because many on The Left feel similarly but have come to opposite conclusions

It's like they're trying to create an iconic moment when Biden has the Trump wall torn down
Biden seems to have a deep well of personal empathy in one-on-one interactions, but I remain somewhat skeptical of his capacity for systemic empathy.
Beyond parody. Democrats controlled the House, Senate, and presidency for 2 years under Obama-Biden and they refused to increase wages to $15. We can‚Äôt even cut the Pentagon budget to reinvest it into our communities.
Sanders gaslighting his supporters is a new level of commitment to defeat Trump. I wish he had that same commitment during his campaign against Biden. You don‚Äôt have to lie about Biden and his platform. Just say Trump is dangerous. That‚Äôd be enough for me. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Your ignorance is astounding. Carlin was speaking about the system &amp; how both parties cater to the billionaires and Wall Street while ignoring the needs of the people. Carlin‚Äôs words can just as easily be used against Biden‚Äôs record as they can Trump, as well as your ignorance.
we love all your shows especially this last Thursday panel with Bevelyn! You guys were right that there is something planned. You need to watch the X22Report daily! There is a switch with Biden coming! People need to be prepared!
heh ye said he gon beat Biden off
Would be hilarious.  Biden would have no clue. Dave would run wild
Maybe... Joe Biden.
Why resign when term almost up? S/h resigned a few years ago. Fact: Trusted Trump like so many others. Fact: Nice fix he has gotten himself into.   BUT Vice Presidency actually can be a winning position. Ask Joe Biden!
I'm waiting for Biden to be asked if he took the same test as Trump and have him answer, "My doctors have not suspected that I am suffering from dementia and therefore haven't given me any tests to check for mental impairment."
But for how long will you vote Democratic? A one-off vote for Biden is not going to be enough to turn this country around and mend all the damage done by Trump, Bush 2, and Reagan.
So Joe Biden day BLM?
Still confused on how Biden won the primary tbh
Oddly, Biden didn't blink in pulling that trigger months ago.
My child.  You just made my point.  Trump lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes. Actual American voters rejected him as a sexist, racist, xenophobe by a huge margin. Thank you for agreeing with me.  And, again, I'm glad Joe Biden has been called out by Democrats.
Hell no, I don‚Äôt want nothing to do Biden! He‚Äôs a pervert!
Elect Biden and we'll find out real fast.
To all MAGA Trump supporters, BIDEN IS WAY BETTER THAN TRUMP!!! üñïüñïüñïüñï
Biden is a sidestep in place.  Nothing will change.
#ImVoting4BidenBecause Biden is WAY MORE BETTER THAN TRUMP!!!Blaming the people pointing out Biden's flaws instead of putting the pressure on Biden to NOT have those flaws is ridiculous. We have morals on this side of the aisle, and saying we should not criticize him bc it will hurt his chances is real dumb.
And nobody said I'm not voting for Biden. I'm just not going to pretend he isn't an absolute trash candidate. He may be going up against a shit sandwich but I'm not going to pretend he's not the fat free shit sandwich
Lobbying Intensifies Among V.P. Candidates as Biden‚Äôs Search Nears an End
Of course we will. We will be much safer with Biden than with the lying autocrats of Trump Pence! Losers
Hey, Doughboy! I can project the results of this fair election right now! Biden wins! And you are so afraid of losing you are trying to sow seeds of dissent and doubt. Your excuses are meaningless, Loser!
You‚Äôve lost your mind just like Biden. Trump is the only logical choice.
While I understand why Trump wants to delay the election this must not happen the Democrats will say Trump is only trying to rig the election Biden has already said Trump will try and steal the election a delay will make it seem he was right!
Truth! Vote Biden!!!
Tbh it's hard for me to say who will win. A lot of the polls are pretty close afaik and Biden unapologetically saying fuck you to leftists doesn't help
For real. I may very very reluctantly vote for Biden because the other option is far worse, but I'm not going to pretend a vomit sandwich is gourmet compared to a shit sandwich
Too many people are voting for Biden for all the wrong reasons. I can respect you if your reason is because you are (rightfully) afraid of what Trump is capable of, based on the shit that is happening in Portland and NY right now.
I made a deal with a friend. I'll vote for Biden and they'll read, "The State And Revolution" and post a report about it on their Social Media.  I bet people with an audience could leverage quite a bit more than me though.
This is a 100% sincere offer and I think all of us on the Left should be making it.   Read and report on 1 book by a Revolutionary Leftist, and I'll vote for Biden.  Read and report on a 2nd, and I'll vote blue down the ballot.  Tag me in it and you'll buy my vote.  #Read4Biden
No, I am voting for Biden.
You're a total idiot Joe Biden will never get elected you're beyond pathetic and a disgrace to decent Americans everywhere!
They must not want to protect the most important person in our country due to his attitude????  Maybe they could hold him by his arm like they have to for wannabe president  joe Biden lol
I‚Äôm sure you were thinking about how to tell Biden more ways to try to ruin the country like you tried to
During a week in Cocoa Beach; only sign of #Biden support.  These ‚Äúkids‚Äù were asking for honks.
He seems to be doing his job for Putin and wreaking havoc on Americans.  We need a real president like Biden who will put Americans first.
WTH??? Now you are selling books?? You really aren‚Äôt a president! You are a bad joke and we will all breathe better the day after Biden takes over! I just wonder where you will go?? Jail?
We need Joe Biden. The Trumps need to go to jail. All of them!
I mean I can totally understand. Have you seen the shit that is happening on the streets of Portland and NYC? That shit is TERRIFYING. I don't blame or shame people for folding to Biden in the face of that, because that is wild. This breach of citizens rights is unprecedented
If the majority of the American people can stop and think they will see that everything Trump is doing and had done is for them Trump will be reelected but if the Democrats can succeed in making a majority of the American people forget that fact Biden will be the next president!
I‚Äôm determined to vote for Biden, and I will, but this is unsustainable, to say nothing of it being deeply, fundamentally unethical. Medicare for ALL.
Biden should come out for monthly payments to all adults of $2,000 and brand them as BidenBuck$.
If anything, recent events have shown us that Democrats, and subsequently, Biden, don't care about the people. All they care about is getting Trump out of office. It just so HAPPENS that getting Trump out of office benefits the people, but that is not their purpose for doing it.
So, while I have conceded that it would PROBABLY be better in the short term to vote Biden instead of third party, I have henceforth decided to withhold my decision on who I am voting for til the time comes to vote.
So, I said this literally 5 days ago. Not even a work week from then, and somehow the DNC has made me hate them even more and has gotten me to think about reconsidering my long long struggle with trying to figure out whether I should vote Green or for Biden. What even
Wait. You get geography of America wrong all the time djt. And you of all people are calling someone else out on it? You are more demented than Biden
Florida is behind Biden by 8 points... trump never won by a landslide either. Also Minnesota is still blue
Great question Neil I'm glad you asked:   After Biden + the 107th Congress passed the BONG Act (Boomers Organized to Nullify Ganja) the FCC began limiting the amount of music from paraphernalia-sponsored bands and I accidentally used up all my 2020 minutes on 2 Bongripper jams :(
Unless the majority of the American people are total fools or complete idiots Joe Biden will not be president yet even as I think this thought I remind myself that roughly half of the county is occupied by liberals and they are total fools and complete idiots scares me to death!
and  are the two best picks for Biden‚Äôs VP. They‚Äôre more moderate than what I‚Äôd like, but much better than the other options.
needs a studio with no audience, like that Bernie/Biden debate
When trump says his supporters have more enthusiasm than Biden‚Äôs, he clearly underestimated how much we want him out of office and in prison with the rest of his crime family.
I saw this Biden support squad asking for Honks in Cocoa Beach.... I didn‚Äôt hear any honks.  lol üòÇ
The real ‚Äúsilent majority‚Äù are the many Americans who can‚Äôt stand Biden and will be bullying him to the left (even if we‚Äôre skeptical) if he wins, but will voting for him to stop Trump as damage control. The left movement isn‚Äôt going anywhere.
If I have to explain it, there's no help for you. Biden is whatever his puppets want him to be. He is no moderate.
As trump creates violence for photo ops to use as ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs America,‚Äù do all his campaign advisors think voters are so dumb they don‚Äôt know who the president is.  Dems should be airing photos of trump‚Äôs America where moms and veterans are gassed and shot.
and they will continue to be whether it's Trump or Biden as president
While I totally agree with you, we can't forget that Biden helped write the crime bill in 1994 that by and large created the escalated police presence that we see today
However, from a perspective of doing the most good in an immediate sense, then unfortunately voting for Biden is the choice that makes the most sense from a consequentialist perspective given the profound violations of the rights of American citizens that Trump had perpetuated
Your are SO right,  Trump!!   YOU will not rename the bases. But Congress and President Biden WILL.
I swear to everything holy that if Joe Biden is fairly elected the POTUS I will accept that victory in the exact same manner that the Democrats accepted Donald Trump. I swear. Because I'm a giverü§£

I cant figure out why Joe Biden is running for president
Sleepy Joe Biden who?!?!

This is what I don‚Äôt get either. ‚ÄúThis would be Biden‚Äôs America‚Äù bitch that‚Äôs RIGHT NOW. I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm voting Biden, but this is literally trumps america right now. What the fuck.
I won't be voting for him or Trump.  Spare me the whole "election of our life time" garbage, hear it every 4 years.  Biden said back in 2012 that Romney would put blacks back in chains...  I'm looking for a party that wants to represent me, not the lesser of 2 evils.
Nah he passed that cognitive test. I want to see Biden try one. It beat two CNN anchors.
The Biden one.
Your personal franchise is your personal franchise and I do not have a perfect perspective. This projection of what I will do does not mean that I do not support any of my followers who aren't voting for Biden. I still very much empathize and agree with most of your points.
I will never pretend that Biden will be a good president. I will never pretend that Biden is a good person. I will still criticise him just as much. Unfortunately, the damage Trump can and will do is much greater of a threat than Biden's damage. It sucks, but that's how it is.
However, don't get it twisted: I still stand for everything I stand for. I still believe in changing the way we vote. I still believe that Joe Biden is a rapist and that rapists should not be leaders. However, as an individual, we have very little choice IN THIS MOMENT
So, I have come to the conclusion that while I stand EXTRAORDINARILY in opposition to everything Joe Biden stands and has stood for. However, I would be hard pressed to say the harm done by a Biden presidency would ever compare to the harm Trump has the potential to propagate.
Trump tweets to suburban moms that Portland‚Äôs unrest is what they‚Äôll get back.  Suburban moms yell Biden won‚Äôt teargas or shoot us!
Biden can't remember what he's running for. Isn't he running for Senate ? Who ties Joe's shoes ?
Another thing that brings me hope is that somehow Joe Biden was better than anyone else in the primary. Think how miserable Bernie, Elizabeth, Pete, Kamala, and Corey feel every time they hear Joe's babble.
Biden is üß†üíÄ
Biden would be the 46th racist US president
Because I'm seeing a lot of people using the same rhetoric for Shahid as we do for Biden. "He's not perfect and if we don't put him in office we'll just have Pelosi." He has denied the allegations personally, but hasn't made any sort of attempt credibly do so.
The weird mental deficiency that Trump's supporters seem to universally have is alarming. Like, you can't pass the buck to someone who isn't even in fucking office. Even if they're saying that everything that's going on is a result of Obama/Biden's policies, that's way off base.
Getting a new president isn't going to fundamentally make everything better, because "going back to normal" is still quite the shitty existence, given that Biden's (and the rest of the government's) "normal" is drone striking brown kids in the middle east. The system is broken.It depends. If he loses this election and Biden doesn‚Äôt wuss out like Obama did with those who ruined the economy, it‚Äôs possible but not likely. If NY goes after him he may.
I remember that. And Biden supporters acted like we were being unreasonable for calling it out
I had to block Bernie at the end of his campaign when he decided to help Biden with debate questions. Their friendship was the final straw for me
You just described Joe Biden to a tee!
Doesnt matter what they come up with. Voting for Biden no matter what. There is no one worse than trump
That is EXACTLY what he is doing. He wants to leave a huge mess. If by some really unfortunate fluke he won he would not have the skills to fix it. Biden will bring in a competent team that can immediately start moving in the right direction.
That‚Äôs not your call, Chucko!  Be careful what you ask for.  You‚Äôll be singing a different tune if Biden has majority votes that night.
This is what the media does.  If they disagree with somebody telling the truth, they try to find something in their past to discredit them. What about doctor Fauci's past? Or better yet how about Joe Biden's?

Excuse me, sir  , Mr Biden has not #MaskedUp
So ridiculous that you cant see your own hypocrisy. Joe devestated black communities, voting for him is saying you don't care? And don't worry I'm in these streets, fighting for people "i don't care about" with a bunch of others who ain't Ridin with Biden.

Biden wouldn't throw away a pandemic plan (left to him by the previous, successful, president) without first establishing a new one.   Like, throwing away Trump's plan obviously would be ok, since 140k+ people have died.  I could come up with a better plan than "do nothing".
Tom, I totally agree.  Take a break from protesting so trumps fake soldiers have nobody to attack.  When Biden wins we will all be behind you and real change can happen.
Hey,  what is Biden going to do to attract people to his left?  Absolutely nothingI know that instead of choosing an actual woman or a survivor to work with, she chose a politician that is later revealed to be a predator If she can apologize for her work with R kelly, the rapist, she can apologize for working with joe Biden, the rapist ü•¥

It was in 2016, and he‚Äôs been anti woman‚Äôs right to choose since the 80s.... and he fondled children... R Kelly‚Äôs takedown was in 2019, DWUW was in 2013.... If she can denounce her work with R Kelly, she can denounce her work with Joe Biden

Biden wouldn't throw away a pandemic plan (left to him by the previous, successful, president) without first establishing a new one.   Like, throwing away Trump's plan obviously would be ok, since 140k+ people have died.  I could come up with a better plan than "do nothing".

Tom, I totally agree.  Take a break from protesting so trumps fake soldiers have nobody to attack.  When Biden wins we will all be behind you and real change can happen.
A real view of how Democrat run cities work. It's the dysfunction that explains their failure. This is where the Democrats have taken us and where will are all headed with a Biden puppet presidency.

Joe Biden narrows down his VP list, with Karen Bass emerging as one of several key contenders
Also they just said he was pulling his ad buying to change their message.  "Sleepy Joe" has been his lame message since the start. He has been afraid of Biden or else he would never have asked for help beating Joe. #TrumpHasLost
Hmmm...your losing in Texas and Florida as well. Sleepy Joe is very a old and tired cliche. You need something with more relevance.  Something like "Joe Biden would never tear gas your Mom like I will" That shows Americans your toughness.
Joe Biden is expected to announce his running mate next week; all of the perceived frontrunners are pro-abortion &amp; support the LGBT agenda.  Given Biden's issues with mental fitness, his VP choice is likely to take over at some point, should he win.
Yes and he must walk through a two columns of people - Black Lives Matter Protesters on the left and Moms and Veterans whom he gassed on the right - on his way to the police van. Biden and Obama get to shut the doors on the vehicle - and America returns to her greatness.
As a (Black) suburban mother, I knew exactly what that coded language meant. He was saying if Biden is elected, the Black folk are moving to the suburbs(OMG!). Dude, we‚Äôre already here and we love it!
You WILL know like 4 hours after the polls open. Biden with 85% of the electoral college locked up. That leaves no way to protest the results. Have no fear, the Blue Wave is poised to roll tide on November 3rd, voter suppression or no, it wont matter.
The newspapers in the state that he Governs has to beg him for help - and he loves and cherishes every second of that because to him, that makes him powerful.  He's nothing but a spineless, sycophant, small-minded Trump follower who, once Biden takes office will not last long.
If Trump pounded a much better candidate and had no record the first time, his defeat of Biden will be epic.
If Biden doesn‚Äôt want to move further left when he needs our votes the most, how are we gonna get him to even consider fighting for M4A, green new deal or any other progressive policies when he‚Äôs in office already? Please enlighten me..
I don‚Äôt know.  It‚Äôs 50/50.  Biden isn‚Äôt hated the way Hillary is.  If Biden avoids public speaking and debates, he just might win.

This one is easy. He is no longer president. Biden is and Biden then assumes military control just as Trump has. So Biden, smiling all the way, simply orders the military to throw him out. Any officer not following that order is guilty of treason. Period. This is a non-issue

And his job tenure will be shortest on record. He is gone after 11/03/2020. President Biden will not stand for it. This goon and all the other complicit people Trump installed with no qualifications or merits.  America will be back from this Trump golf vacation on 11/03/2020
Translation:What we already knew. When Biden wins, the election will be deemed ‚Äúrigged‚Äù by Trump and his Cult.The ? is, will Trump try to ‚ÄúExecutive Order‚Äùan attempt to overrule our laws,again, and use crook AG Barr to rubber stamp it. Remember, he‚Äôs trying to avoid a prison cell
The polls will tighten. It‚Äôs inevitable. However, if Biden gets 51% of the vote in certain states, he can‚Äôt lose...unless Betsy DeVos is doing the counting.
Trump convinced me to vote for Biden.
Same here....heading back to the UP Thursday and last yime there not a single Biden sign or bumper sticker
I love it that Biden is leading in Florida. DeSantis has done everything except legally change his last name to Trump to appease his master. Now he owns the largest hotspot of Covid in the US, got caught faking death numbers, can't get rallys or conventions held. WINNING!
President Biden, as a celebration victory lap, should invite voters to come and "knock the hell out of that wall until there is nothing left."  It would be so symbolic of America's change back into a free society and away from fascism.
Well, considering Trump bailed on one of the GOP actual televised primary debates last year, Biden skipping a FOX interview is no biggie for many of us!

If he thinks there is no enthusiasm on the left, it's because people are asking the wrong question.  It's not "how enthusiastic are you to vote for Biden", it's "how enthusiastic are you to vote to remove Trump"
Absolutely.  I'm not waiting in super long lines during this pandemic.  But if I have to, I will to make sure that Biden gets my vote!
Except the difference here is that Biden knows when he misspeaks, unlike you, who would have gone to your grave claiming AZ was a city... you probably would have even used a sharpie to make your case.

We are only 3 1/2 months away from election. You will not change a Trumpers mind (theres little to work with there anyway). Resisters love and know Dr. Fauci is a source of truth. Reps. are wasting their money and time. When Mr. Biden announces his VP this election is over.
Fun fact: Trump would also currently lose to Biden in the rest of the free world - except for Russia and Saudi Arabia.   So at least he has a couple of choices to move to after January 2021.  Look for more Goya ads from the entire Trump family emanating from the USSR in January.

I love that  is waiting until the last second to announce his candidate. A) this is driving Trump crazy because it takes time to create all the smear ads against that person, and B) Biden has already told the person who it is so they can have they pressers ready. Smart.
IE, he did not.  Instead he got information about the red folders given to the Republicans who were in Russia on July 4th. Its just fake dirt on Biden more than likely.
Can you imagine if Biden were to throw out the first pitch? It would be like the old married couple playing golf in Caddyshack. "...Your ball is over here Mr. Haverkamp."
I wish it would end if/when Trump loses the election on November 3, but you know he will be doing some crazy shit until Biden is sworn into office.

Ha, sorry, I thought you were replying to the cancellation of the Trump-Biden debate at ND.
How do you explain Biden's trumping Trump in the polls, then, Ronna? I'll wait...
{ major announcement}   Joe Biden says he will name a vice-president on    Nov.  3rd 2020 ..before midnight(or around then) soon as he gets up from Nap time..HE IS DOWN TO SEVENTEEN PICKS AS OF NOW
So, Joe Biden spent 36 years in the US Senate and 8 years as Vice President keeping women down?
If we have regular traditional Obama/Biden Democrats running the place it is easy to grease their palms to get what you want.  It is all good with me no matter who wins.  My life will go on no matter what.  Both sides sound like the just got out of a Jim Jones compound.
If I had to bet I would say Trump ends up with 46% of the National popular vote.  If Biden cracks 49% he wins more than likely
Jill Biden: we will be there to restore the garden after Malaria leaves!
Most Trump voters I know tell the pollster they are voting for Biden.  They think it is funny to see if they can throw the polls off.
Biden has already won.  No need to show up to actually vote for him.  I won‚Äôt waste my time
The death toll from the coronavirus pandemic is surging, the economic recovery appears to be slipping backward and racial divisions are still exploding. Do you think President Trump has a chance of overcoming all of this to beat Joe Biden in the election?
Lots of voters in their fifties think Biden is not too old! Lots of voters in their sixties feel the same! We are the anti ageism generation!
You sound panicky and unsure, underneath all that empty blather. And you should. Biden's trumping Trump everywhere, even in red states.
It's going to JOE BIDEN basement...idiots..BLM DOES NOT GIVE A DAM ABOUT BLACK AMERICAN CITIZENS..THEY WILL DESTROY AMERICAN BLACK CITIZENS.BURNED DOWN A BLACK AMERICAN CITIZEN OWNED AUTO GARAGE IN CHICAGO..NO ONE HELPING HIM NO ONE HELPING REBUILD BLACK LEADERS SAY F U TO HIM

The ACA and the public option are not Medicare for all. Biden does oppose Medicare for all. He also wants to cut social security Medicare and Medicaid.
A new poll finds that Joe Biden's supporters are less enthusiastic than President Trump's ‚Äî both about the campaign itself and about their candidate.
Really! Anybody that listens to Biden vs Trump &amp; they let you fool them into believing that Trump is more intelligent than Biden, that person got to be stuck on stupid! Or live for and love corruption like you and Trump. Don't care about Trump being a TRAITOR &amp; wannabe Dictator!
Cutest Biden supporter winner!
If you are considering a vote for VP Biden -  WATCH THIS before you vote.
‚ÄúIf you vote for Biden, you‚Äôre going to be living in Nazi Germany, that's what it's going to be like,‚Äù the woman with the swastika mask said in the video as her husband loaded bags of groceries into a shopping cart.
&gt; Human and drug trafficking along the border is down significantly.  &gt; No more regime change wars: Pulled troops out of Afghanistan. (All of the Neocon war criminals endorsed Biden btw) &gt; Highest black unemployment rate in history (pre covid)
Trump carried Michigan in 2016 by a narrow 10,704-vote margin. The new CNN poll put Biden on top there by 52% to 40%. Another poll released Sunday, from CBS/YouGov, showed Biden leading by 6 points.
Metaphor for  presidency #TrumpWallComeTumblingDown
Awww, someone's been reading about his tanking poll numbers, especially in Florida. And Pennsylvania's Biden's home state, Doofus.
And this is why you are one of the most corrupt Presidents ever. Because Joe Biden Don't need Russia or China to help them Win the election. Joe Biden will Win because he is an honest and caring and honorable man. He's not killing Americans with Trump Virus, or Golfing. Vote Nov3
Joe Biden can shoot someone on fifth Avenue and won't lose a vote.
If nothing has moved you to ore Biden, this should do it...
Despite the former VP's lead - more of Trump‚Äôs voters strongly back him than Biden‚Äôs supporters do, and the president holds a significant lead on handling the economy.
I lived in a self policed community! I don‚Äôt remember needing cops to keep the Klan away! In fact I don‚Äôt remember Chaos until your cops came along! Your safety versus mine Your crime stats vs the UN that‚Äôs why I am voting Biden!
No one is above the Law , Obama and Biden included.
So this guy gathered politicians as well as fellow molestors! Is there any evidence of Joe Biden being there , or is this pure QAnon?
Joe Biden is going to kill yall!
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Joe Biden is running a campaign like a person who is kicking Donald Trump's ass, even in the FOX POLLS by at least 11 points! Also you say the Democrats are losing really bad, Joe is winning in some polls by 20 points, if you call that losing, we rather stay on the losing side.
Biden probably plagiarized quotes from the movie for his speeches.  LOL
Biden was on MSNBC five days ago!
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
You will beat Biden off ?
All you and Sean Hannity complain about is how far Joe Biden is going left. That's the way Democrats go and  Republicans go right. Do ya'll actually think the Democrats should go, FAR RIGHT! You don't know how ignorant ya'll sound!
Cardi talks with Biden about Trump not apologizing and using the right production for coronavirus. Trump is not doing anything that contains better benefits and I agree with both of them when they were on IG live. That makes him think precisely about not caring.
Yesss Cardi is talking with Joe Biden about how Trump is being so arrogant with the coronavirus and everything. Love to see her on live ü•∞üòçüòç

New evidence just shows how much more Trump and company is in trouble! Keep it coming! CROSS FIRE HURRICANE, Obama, Biden, Comey, McCabe, and Strok, them some bad boys!
And here's a troubling current matter. #MSM, STOP dwelling on the 'horse race' and Biden's lead in the polls! I've no doubt Biden will prevail among voters. Rather, the issue is massive efforts to suppress voters and meddling the voting process. Follow  !
Everyone better vote for Biden no matter who he picks for VP. Cry, debate, even fight for your person, but don‚Äôt you dare let it keep you from the polls.
Biden is up 13 points ahead of Trump in Florida. F-L-O-R-I-D-A. Just thought you'd like to know.
In a  poll out today, Biden has a 9-point lead over Trump in Michigan and an 11-point lead in Pennsylvania. Both states that Trump won in 2016.
Does this horse's ass Gidley know that Biden is ahead of Trump by 13 points in Florida??? FLORIDA.
Biden's ahead of you by 13 points in Florida. FLORIDA. Just thought you'd like to be reminded.
Sean played some of Joe Biden's gaffes to suggest that he's not all there. But, Joe is still smashing Trump, even in FOX POLLS by 11 points, 20 points in another &amp; from 13 to 9 in 4 swing states. So that should tell you what people think of Trump's competency. Trump's Doomed!
Just found out that Chasten's and Pete's wedding was a topic in the Joe Biden Podcast "Biden's Briefing" (which he released between leaving office and running for President) back in 2018! via /r/Pete_Buttigieg  #PeteForAmerica #Pete2020
Have you seen the FOX POLLS today. Biden is slaughtering Trump!
So, I guess Joe Biden is going to do the same thing at his political rallies that Clinton tried to pull off in 2016.  Does anyone else remember the photoshopped crowds of excited people that HRC's PR team tried to pull off 4 years ago?
Yep. You can be conservative and vote for Joe Biden. You can't be conservative and vote for Joe Biden AND hope for a Dem Senate.
Fox News poll shows Trump trailing Biden in Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania | TheHill
Biden isnt president yet, you sauceless lasagna
I think it should be a Biden-Obama ticket, Michele Obama.
Yeah the POTUS was Putin in his new orders for November, since he knows Biden is gonna hand him his ass on a plate in November. So he wants to talk to Putin to make sure his corrupt people are getting ready for November. So he can stay Putin's Bitch. Let's get his corrupt ass out
I believe Texas will fall! I know the Senate will fall! Biden We are on alert! Biden will save the country!
Show pix of tRumps amerika and call it Biden's...how silly and rude. Boris knows this will end  Nov. 3rd.
Hey POTUS! You want to Make America Great Again do us a favor by not doing us any favors. We are now at 4Million Confirmed cases, and people wanted Obama gone for 2 deaths. Just resign, because with these numbers you have no chance in November. Keep that seat ready for Joe Biden
If Trump said anything remotely close to that, his comments would be headline news for 2 weeks...then there's those stupid bobble heads in the podcast agreeing with Biden.  ü§îüôÑ

This already IS  America. They used video that is currently happening to say this ‚Äúcould ‚Äú happen with Joe Biden. This is On Trump‚Äôs watch. #Biden2020ToSaveAmericaIt‚Äôs abundantly clear that Biden doesn‚Äôt run his own Twitter account. You should try to find someone who is almost as incoherent as he is to Tweet for him; that way it‚Äôs at least somewhat believable
Sounds like you talking about the police union. STOP SPREADING FALSE PROPAGANDA COLLUDIE. REPENT AND JOIN TRUMPERS FOR BIDEN TEAM.
RESIGN NOW AND STOP SPREADING FALSE PROPAGANDA. Repent and JB will accept you with open arms. Come join the TRUMPERS FOR BIDEN TEAM. Win win PEEPSQUEAK
Trump supporters are probably being mean because you propped yourself as a pro Trump guy for months, probably to get likes, and then you drop the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm voting Biden‚Äù bombshell. What did you expect?  Don‚Äôt be so weak minded to even contemplate suicide. Be better than that
We don‚Äôt even know who ‚ÄúYou‚Äù are. We all know good and damn well Biden isn‚Äôt tweeting. He can‚Äôt speak in complete sentences. He sure as hell can‚Äôt type
My prediction: 1. Biden will be a removed before the election. The female VP will be the presidential candidate, she will choose a female VP.  2. If Biden is elected he will be removed via health issues or some other means. VP will become President &amp; she will choose a female VP.
If Biden doesn‚Äôt tap you for a cabinet position won‚Äôt you please run for Governor. We need you!
247 people watching Bidens live stream. There is no way the actual number of people who will vote for him is this high. If a pollster asked me who I was voting for I'd say Biden just because I don't want my life ruined by Democrats. But I would vote Trump on election day.
But the legacy media told me Biden was trouncing President Trump! üôÑ 2020 is going to be 2016 all over again but with bigger tears and more hysterical reactions
Is the truth. WEAR A DAMNNN MASK AND help with slowing the spread. We have this pandemic because people like you REFUSE TO WEAR A MASK üò∑. Stop üõë spreading false propaganda. REPENT NOW AND BIDEN WILL ACCEPT YOU with open arms.

To be fair, your trying to project #MangoMessiah's dementia onto VP Biden is tired and played out. Clean your own house. Dementia Donnie is throwing poop on the walls again.
Trojan horse used to sneak soldiers in Biden dems coming strait at you calling your lies you know like non cowards do they don't wait till your gone and bad mouth ya waaawaaawaa mommy she couldn't stand ya either lying pos
I don't think it was Obama and Biden personally. USA has long history of not prosecuting the President for crimes commited as sitting POTUS after they leave office. Watch though, that tradition will change in 2025 when President Trump leaves office.

Hey y‚Äôall, we can both vote Trump out and not elect Biden at the same time. #MojoJoJo.
exactly....you have to get moderates to vote for Biden. You know the Kips and Karens out in the suburbs. We cant win elections with just the 40% of the population that totally agrees with us.
So Biden is going to roll out "that's a joke" to cover up his obvious dementia. How many 'jokes' will he tell between now and November?
Biden is basically trying to get out of picking a woman VP because he really wants an old white guy on the neoliberal spectrum that he can vibe with. So think about his best buds when he was in the Senate...and Joe's list becomes pretty obvious.
Bernie‚Äôs co-chair 100% right their is NO Differences between Biden/ trump there will be NO Changes No Nothing if we Can‚Äôt have the people‚Äôs Nominee Then No one should vote for the 1% democrats/republicans We should Vote Green Party we can have it all and loose the 1%‚Äôs Corruption
By electing Joe Biden. #Biden2020Landslide #BidenLandslide2020 #TrumpCantKeepItUp
trump - we will all definitely make America Great Again by ALL voting for JOE BIDEN!!
That‚Äôs not fair bro. Americans as a whole are good people - we have more protestors for BLM then all of trumps rallies ever combined - New York City alone has more diversities in one block living together in peace than entire nations - we are Still Good, don‚Äôt let this define us
Won't matter where, if Biden conditions debates on having no live audience. Without an audience, he can win a debate with Trump.
I tried to like Cenk, I really did.. But.. Damnit, he makes it difficult. Don't get me wrong, I feel that Liz would be a fantastic VP (she was my first choice for Pres all through this) and and I hope that who Biden goes with. But I understand the value of a strategic choice.
All the Democrats are involved, they don't need Biden. We also need President Trump and  to take these programs off the books!
Democrats want to destroy every neighborhood, every quiet property, every moment of peace and quiet for suburbia. It's a crisis not getting enough attention.
Yes and everyone is ignoring this. Everyone's ability to live in peace and quiet, have large home gardens, have quiet private property, have safety for their kids are all in peril.
this is exactly what we see with biden
If corporate media reporters see the subjugation, it's legit news. If a protester posts the same on social media, it's not legit news. Then Biden hops on TV &amp; proclaims the need for unity &amp; that the protesters got too violent. Media plays his speech... /2
Joe doesn‚Äôt just have her. Joe Biden has basically all of NATO and Hollywood but for maybe Boris Johnson and James Wood waiting for him to walk that mf out of our White House.
Joe Biden used the ‚ÄúN‚Äù word 13 times while speaking in Congress. He compared sending white kids to school with black kids, to sending white kids into the jungle.  Trump had record low black unemployment, record high black wages. He funded HBCUs permanently.
Go here, too:

If the don‚Äôt vote for Biden, Then they were Trump supporters to begin with.
How much are the white Biden supporters being paid and by whom. Are they being paid by the same leftists who are paying the BLM protesters.
That‚Äôs Why Biden thinks he‚Äôs Leading in The Polls.
Curb the pandemic in US is first order of business for Biden. If we can stop our people from dying, nothing else matters.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.    DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
So, here‚Äôs the thing. I don‚Äôt know that Biden is going to be a good President, either. He was not a choice I was going to make before my choices dropped out. But Sanders wasn‚Äôt either. He belongs in Congress imo. Biden is the only choice bc FACISM is the alternative. PERIOD.
Cool Story. Biden never said Nuke a Hurricane. Biden never allowed Bounties on American Soldiers. But cool story I guess
We don‚Äôt WANT him to change! We don‚Äôt want a leftist puppet like Biden. He‚Äôs yours.
Thing is, Biden can't beat Trump. Everybody already forgot about all of the closet Trump supporters that came out in droves last time. The polls are all done by leftist social media companies, not real numbers. Biden's who said Blacks live in jungles.
What about Biden???? He can‚Äôt keep his hands off kids and women. The worse part is he thinks it all okay cause he chummy and means no harm.
I think there are several Political figures. Clinton, Biden, Obama, Comey just to name a few.
In other words, if Joe Biden gets elected she will be our next president.That sucks on many levels.
How can anyone say Biden and president with a straight face
Not until Biden goes back on his promise to ban the online sale of firearms and ammunition.
He is such a loser. Bite me Biden
In my defense this is a Marvel household - only Astrid likes the DC Superhero Girls
If Biden wins we are next! China wants the world #WakeUpAmerica  and  will sell us out
Look like fishing hats? Knight and his squire?
David is not making Biden look bad - Biden is.  He is not cherry-picking, he is rotten apple picking.  Biden promised us to rein in Wall Street then he tells Wall Street that he intends to let them have a free reign.  It seems to be raining lies.
I guessed John Wayne lmao ok um. Cowboys? I was born in 1992 üò≠
I am so backwards my fav kid pic of me is me at like 10 standing next to the Donor Party Memorial because the first movie I really ever remember watching is The Shining and when I asked my parents about it they said the only thing real about The Shining is the Donor Party
Right on
Damn bro I don‚Äôt even kno WHO the hillbilly bears were suppose to be mocking - the cartoon was only still on tv for like the first 3 yrs of my existence - uh John Wayne? Little house on the prairies?
I have no idea then. Dress up? Ur moms hats? Pretending to be the hillbilly bears? ü§£

G U M sorry üôÑ
It looks like t-ball. And the old gun
#ImVoting4BidenBecause  no one has to explain to Biden why we should care about one another
Media doesn't have to watch. They just get an email from the Biden campaign with their talking points.The #BidenWarrenFundraiser reminded me why I fell in love with  and if she‚Äôs not VP I hope she has some role in the #Biden administration
Stop with the false allegations... it's easy to research the real stuff!
Because shit neoliberalism leaves out almost half of society. When people get frustrated enough they‚Äôre willing to elect anybody. Someone worse will follow Biden if he doesn‚Äôt actually enact the progressive change that the majority wants to see. He can talk a good game all day.
100%. I‚Äôm voting for Biden no matter what but Harris is by far the worst potential VP under consideration IMO. Warren, Duckworth, Bass, and Rice would all be better.
Right now i'm an outcast I don't support Biden but that doesn't mean I support Trump. I know a lot of people hate that but i'm not going to lie.
I‚Äôm team Biden, but I can promise you the largest voting demographic in the 2020 election will be old white men who are deciding between 2 old white men.
good for you if you like Biden but I don't. I don't pretend to like someone or settle that is not who I am.
Thank you next President Biden.  We look forward to you helping rebuild America, and helping cast out the destroyers of America.
I love so much that the Trump campaign‚Äôs brilliant idea is to paint Biden as a swamp establishment politician that‚Äôs been in DC for 40 years then in the next breath say Biden is a puppet of the ‚ÄúBernie/AOC socialists‚Äù.
Obama barely endorsed Biden. You can see the sadness in his eyes in the video.
An FYI,  it's my understanding that Biden has asked that all of his staffers to uninstall TikTok from their devices.
Seems reasonable, but you could write this article about any of the finalists. Not quite cut &amp; paste, but close. Because Biden is so hard to demonize, the GOP will twist themselves in knots to demonize the VP pick to energize the base. And it will work to some degree. So... yawn.
Lol, I swear I might sleep 12 hours when Biden is sworn in.
what are the liberals gonna do when/if Biden wins and absolutely nothing changes bc that‚Äôs going to happen
95 days until election and still feel sick with the idea of voting for Biden and I know i'm not the only one.
The shakeup at ‚Å¶ by ‚Å¶ Michael Pack is clearly a partisan move by fat boy ‚Å¶ Pack has put Trump loyalists in top positions, yet everyone is whining, suspending journalists over a Biden clip. Really?
A new Yahoo News/YouGov poll: 52% of Americans now believe that #Trump won't accept the results of Nov‚Äôs election if he loses to #JoeBiden. An even larger majority of Trump voters say they too will refuse to accept a narrow loss if #MailInBallots contribute to Biden‚Äôs victory.
The Electoral College isn't necessarily much of an assistance to Rump, although it might be to conservative politicians in general. We should look on the bright side and look at the EC as something Rump can't tamper with. If Biden has a resounding victory, we won't have to worry.
Drump/45 is responsible for 153,000 lives lost on his watch,  can't blame that shit on OBAMA #BlackLivesMatter # vote Biden 2020
Also note that even if Rump stays holed up in the White House, nobody in the Executive Branch has to follow his requests, and if they do, they're likely committing crimes.  They have to answer to the new president, presumably Biden, no matter where he is.
Trump has no ground to reject the results because the entire establishment, military, Security state, republican elite and entirety of DNC want Biden to win. Trump will leave without a whimper
That actually surprises me. Yes I consider Sanders good, seeing as he's who I supported.   I'd rather have a real primary than a slightly better chance of winning 2024. If you've looked at Biden's VP shortlist, you know there's no young option that is actually progressive.
Because almost certainly a "good" younger would run in 2024 or in the unlikely scenario Biden goes for two terms, 2028 and will have no real primary opposition. I'd like the voters to decide who should be the nominee after Biden. Whomever you'd consider good, I probably wouldnt
We don't really need FL. Every 2016 Clinton state (all of which look safe for Biden) and the PA, WI, MI trio (Biden leads in all three by around 5-8) are enough. FL doesn't have much down ballot either, so I think NC, GA, and AZ are better targets.
Vote for Trump &amp; I‚Äôm labeled a racist and a homophobe by the other side.  Vote for Biden &amp; I‚Äôm labeled a racist and pedophile by the other side.  Vote 3rd party &amp; I‚Äôm ‚Äòthrowing my vote away.‚Äô  Don‚Äôt vote at all &amp; I‚Äôm not doing my ‚Äòcivic duty.‚Äô  I am genuinely asking for help.
You cannot convince me this settle for Biden thing is real
I shouldn‚Äôt be expected to cast my vote to a party who doesn‚Äôt represent me or my values, so I won‚Äôt. Joe Biden isn‚Äôt the problem, the party voted down almost every progressive platform. He‚Äôs just the tip of the iceberg
That makes absolutely no sense  all what u are claiming #BlackLivesMatter # vote Biden 2020
Don't count out Duckworth in Biden VP race
And Chomo Joe Biden is a child molester, I'll take the patriot Donald Trump.
Hottdamn that's a bigass cat lol #BlackLivesMatter # vote Biden 2020
LOL the guy was corrupt! He held up the $ until Ukraine removed a CORRUPT dude. tRump held up $ to get a fake investigation announcement against his opponent!  Are they both wrong or just Biden?
Let me guess... if trump wins, he cheated... if Biden wins, it‚Äôs legit
the same people that told you Trump was a Russian spy, Kavanaugh was a rapist and the president colluded with the Ukraine for a crime Biden opening bragged about; are now telling you that it‚Äôs the presidents fault we have this virus and to wear a mask! You have no credibility!
Biden was never President.
Obama speaking for Dementia Joe Biden again
In case you didn‚Äôt know, in the fall of 2019 the economy was already heading into a recession. Coronavirus was nowhere in sight then.
What has trump done in 3 1/2 years other than destroy America in every way possible?
ü§£ Biden isn't anything except a mouth trying to say what others tell him.
Eulogy? All I heard was a campaign speech for Hidin' Biden
Any person that can ONLY FOG A MIRROR occasionally, cannot vote for Biden. This shithead has no idea what to do! Name one thing he has done for Police Reform. I was raised to be law abiding. Now with Biden I can call it a protest while I am looting a retail business
From your words to God‚Äôs ears! I pray and pray and pray for Biden.
Thank you, Joe Biden!
So Biden and Trump can be ‚Äòtwinning‚Äô? üòÖ
Funeral? I thought it was a Biden rally?
Why wait? Biden in a landslide. Start packing now!!!
Just caught in the middle.  He has to protect our federal buildings and biden is acting the same damn way towards the protesters.  But yeah I definitely am still voting for him. I mean who else  lmfao yeah I'm dying off that one!!
Oh like the Russian scam, Kavanaugh is a rapist, and Trump extorted the Ukraine, same crime Biden bragged about!
Yeah he thinks that makes him look less racist if we see him with some ü¶ùü¶ßüêíüêµü¶ç #BlackLivesMatter # vote Biden 2020
Even more than Biden the answer is the entire corrupt machinery behind him
Joe Biden and Robert Byrd were the Jim Crow two of the Democrat party.
Not really, but don't support senile Joe Biden.
Why didn't Biden do all that during his time as VP? Did he hate Obama so much he couldn't stand giving a black man credit?  What a racist creep.
So it‚Äôs looking more more like Kamala will be VP. A VP slot that is much more important than usual considering Biden‚Äôs health. I think out of his ‚Äúlist of candidate nominees ‚Äú she is the best pick. The bar is low but she‚Äôs the best.
But  other than be a Twitter activist what have you done I get why they‚Äôre not verifying you it‚Äôs only public figures.  Wish you wouldn‚Äôt think you‚Äôre hot shit because you have a pod cast and shit on joe Biden. Your why people hate progressives in the dem party.
Can Biden make Obama his VP? Is that allowed?
what do you mean Biden can't choose AOC as VP?
Who would be stupid enough to vote for Biden??
I am willing to walk through a gauntlet of racists with bats to vote for biden.
No it's u ur a racist Republicans are racist u all care nothing abt poor, or black &amp; brown ppl #BlackLivesMatter # vote Biden 2020
I think Joe Biden is a disgrace!
The current occupant of the Whitehouse is racist asf pass it on #BlackLivesMatter # vote Biden 2020
my feelings on joe biden are documented in the annals of history
Biden should promote this tweet.
Then y'all want 2 b surprised when we burn shit dwn , &amp; riot well this is why....#BlackLivesMatter # vote Biden 2020
do you think i have to critique joe biden in order to make light of herman cain's death? is that a prerequisite?
did Biden die?
Biden has a tough road to undo everything Trump has done to our country
If he keeps blaming China for HIS failures I'm going to scream.   But please keep sending him out there. He makes Biden's case for him.
It puts the Biden on its skin or it gets the Trump again!
Soros and communist China owns both Obama and Biden along with the Democrat party and dishonest media.
Trump will win regardless of how many people vote for Biden. It‚Äôll be a repeat of the 2016 election.
Well u need 2 be tryn 2 get those racist cops that killed Breanna Taylor n jail #BlackLivesMatter # vote Biden 2020
He hasn‚Äôt though &amp; has a mass amount of supporters. Very loyal supporters who are all around us. Biden doesn‚Äôt have the following to immediately win this, and he isn‚Äôt gaining them quickly. People can‚Äôt stand him either and every Independent vote is a vote for Trump...
Right bc may he rest n power bc he was a blackman but he was a toe-tapping foot-shuffling ü¶ùü¶ßü¶çüêíüêµ &amp; that's why he was one of a few black ppl  thst racist convention #BlackLivesMatter # vote Biden 2020
Fuck drump,  fuck maga,  fuck Q'anon #BlackLivesMatter # vote Biden 2020
That should go 2 show those that thinking foot-shuffling 4 white folks doesn't get us anywhere so 2 all u ü¶ùü¶ßü¶çüêíüêµ vote Biden 2020
I don't think this necessarily is the conclusion. It's the fear that the Democratic Party establishment, by doing the bare minimum to defeat an toxic incumbent, will not feel compelled to move away from right-center. I'll vote for Biden. But I have NO illusions, either.
Biden wont debate him. If he does, it will be a roast not a debate.
I really don‚Äôt mean to be flippant about Biden‚Äôs mental state, but I do think he‚Äôs suffering some sort of decline. I‚Äôve seen the interviews as I‚Äôm sure you have. As for Cain, there‚Äôs no evidence he got the virus at the rally.
I‚Äôm not a Biden so that‚Äôs fine lol they both terrible candidates
&amp; whats that pic supposed 2 make him , drump/45 seem less racist that photo means nothing once a racist always a racist #BlackLivesMatter # vote Biden 2020
Cooper underperforming Biden? Yeah okay...
On Jan.20th 2009 PBO and VP Biden walked into an Oval office that was in depression and a country on the verge of collapse, Joe's been here,  done that and will  work with all regardless of politics to get us on a path forward.  The pandemic will take longer but moving forward.
I finally thought you posted a poll that was an easy one, but the more I thought about it, the more I realize how funny a Biden presidency could actually be
Lol if you think Biden is the one for that I‚Äôm sorry
Wow 2-3 hours later u say something abt him after he'd still b alive if it wasn't 4 ur bullshit Tulsa rally #BlackLivesMatter # vote Biden 2020
Vote for what ? What change is going to be made that hasn‚Äôt been made in Biden‚Äôs 50 years in office
You just need a good old dose of Barack when you feel like you‚Äôve been run over and over by trump!!!  Vote Biden, vote blue. RIP John Lewis, your bravery and leadership will be missed. Thank you!
Why would anyone vote for Biden?
Yall gave Bill Clinton too much respect with very little rationale  He says stuff like this all the time and he thinks he has a right to. Similar to Joe Biden talking what being "black" is.  I be tired...
I'm pretty sure it's easy for a Republican to vote for Biden, since his policies aren't all that different from the mainstream of the GOP. Pro-war, anti-choice, pro-fossil fuels, pro-corporations, anti-working class, anti-poor.
OBAMA is talking all racist Republicans shut ur fucking mouths #BlackLivesMatter # vote Biden 2020
Of course he meaning that racist drump/45 would do this anything to tryn upstage our greatest president OBAMA #BlackLivesMatter # vote Biden 2020
Everyone turn ur üì∫ on CNN so u can witness the greatest president in our life time # fuck trump # fuck maga # fuck Q'anon #BlackLivesMatter # vote Biden 2020
I'd really wanted to vote for Biden, but his supporters are just vile with their hatred I just can't get behind him.
Hope Biden is able to win and pull her opponent over the edge
Idk but if he's promoting it if I take my black self n that pl they'll probably spit on my üçï lol lmao #BlackLivesMatter # vote Biden 2020
You do realize the coronavirus lockdowns and quarantines are being used fOR the Democrats to tamper with the election and avoid Biden debating on live TV
And you want to cheat to win.   Cause that's the only way Biden can win.
You referred to him winning an election...meaning Biden is the front runner...he can only be leading in the polls...and so was Hillary
I agree.  Get a absentee ballot.  Together we can defeat Joe Biden!  He has to be crushed, humiliated, and driven from office, public life, and society and place in a nursing home's memory unit.  Glad to have you back on the Trump Train.
Joe Biden is expected to accept the party‚Äôs presidential nomination on the final night of the convention, which runs Aug. 17-20, the schedule released late Wednesday said.
I stopped drinking 2 years ago as well, for no other reason then I just lost interest in it.   I did however cry and day drink on Trump‚Äôs Inauguration Day.   On Biden‚Äôs Inauguration Day I might bake cookies and happy cry.
I have a problem with the toxicity of some of her followers. In particular the ones who say they will only vote for Biden if she‚Äôs his vp choice.
Your dude was a no show and can‚Äôt win a primary. It‚Äôs now a binary choice. I‚Äôm sure you will refuse to participate and just stay home and tweet about it. Just know that your vote isn‚Äôt needed and my man, Biden, will make a great POTUS.
Plz do not let drumps wanna b king ass delay the election 4 which he knows he can not legally do #blacklivesMatter # vote Biden 2020
People say #Trump is unpredictable. Is he? Cuz I know someone who seems to have his number.  #JoeBiden2020
Joe Biden is actually Q. Wow!
The thing is...  The media allow republicans to dance off stage when asked hard questions and then allow them to stand and bullshit about conspiracy theories.  You can‚Äôt get John Kennedy to answer anything unless he wants to smear Biden about Ukraine.  Then he has time to talk.üôÑ
To all the people staying home on election day because you think Biden is as bad as Trump, I hope you're paying attention here. #DumpTrump2020
Because it will take so long to execute it is not going to happen. President Biden will reverse it.
Biscuit Biden
Trump, Biden, whoever. They are feathers of the same bird. And spoiler alert, they don‚Äôt give a crap about you or me.
He can not delay the election. But I am betting the moment Biden his declared the winner, tRump declares Martial Law. That is if he has not done so before that.
This website is going to be unbearable with Biden announces his VP pick and everyone who proudly tweeted they're not voting hops on to bitch about his pick.
News this morning: Economy is shrinking, virus is spreading,  unemployment is increasing, Biden rising in polls; also this morning  suggest maybe delaying the 2020 election...#ThursdayThoughts
You sent children back to school. You're really afraid of being beaten by Joe Biden. The blood is in the water and the shark is circling. Goodbye.
Biden can‚Äôt even remember what he had for breakfast and he‚Äôs still gunna beat trump.
Joe Biden needs new allies.  They are steering him wrong if they are steering him away from Kamala Harris.  She is top notch
Trump about to start terrorizing cities and will try to delay election cause he know he‚Äôs about to take an L to loser ass Biden lol
And then there's the question of armed white supremacists planning to intimidate black voters at the polls. Turn them away.  Trump supporters with AKs killing Biden voters?
In the beginning, when Trump was riding on Obama‚Äôs coattails, he would brag about what a great presidency ‚Äúhis‚Äù was. Now that the seeds of trump‚Äôs presidency have come to fruition, he blames Obama and Biden. Lol üòÇü§£
Wealth is not fairly gained or kept in this country, ask just about anyone.  Cops are the private security force for the wealthy and well-connected.  Kamala is a cop.  Biden empowers cops to do the bidding of the wealthy.  Neither represents the 99%.
Trump vs. Biden: Where they stand on health, economy, more
Joe Biden sucks. So it doesn't really matter to us. Let this whole place burn.

sounds like joe biden
How long ago was it when Biden proudly promoted segregation?
Dear joe Biden, his campaign staff, and the dnc please don‚Äôt pick Hillary for Vice President
Never trust FL.  Biden will obviously get PA and WI so that alone is game, set, match.  I don't even care about those as much as running up the score.  Just win everything.  Carter won all of 6 states in 1980 and things weren't even a fraction as bad as right now.
Something about these media leaks re: how Biden‚Äôs allies really feel about Kamala feels...uncomfortable.   Biden Campaign: We need to give Black Women (base) something   Black Women: we‚Äôd like Kamala (clearly our favorite) as VP  Biden Campaign: We didn‚Äôt mean her. Who else?
Forget the virus which came from China, trump banded travel from China on Jan, 31, Biden critized trump for doing so, calling him a racist but I‚Äôm sure you care nothing for the facts, just total hatered of trump.
Same. He flipped on trump pretty quick, but I‚Äôm gonna wait and see if he actually supports Biden as president.  Never gonna forgive him for not paying child support, though.
And did you hear what biden said about the protester....... yeah they both playing on the same team bro. Team Epstein dude. Smh
What are y‚Äôall‚Äôs vote for biden memes gunna say when he chooses the top cop prosecutor of Californian? Lmao.

Since many are betting that Biden's running mate will be Kamala Harris, a flashback to my piece on her, with some interesting background on the Obama "birther" controversy, and how it all relates, here:
Boomer Dems be trynna scare leftist millennials and gen z into voting for Biden by using the date of the country being in the balance as if this isn‚Äôt the most nihilistic generation ever and a lot of people would be relieved for the country to be blown up lmao
Biden and trump both suck vote 3rd party thanks for coming to my ted talk
Sleazy Biden is just a battering ram for the commie Dems. He will do whatever they want!  Everything dems accuse Trump of they've done themselves (bullying, lies, chaos). If you can't see that you're blind!  Am I doing this right?!
I'm sure we don't have to worry about Biden doing that.
This is a very dangerous man. He lies like crazy. Does anyone really think that in 4 years, Biden is going to put everyone out of work in Texas? That oil, coal, and gas will no longer be produced? We call this fear mongering. That's what bullies do.

Joe Biden thinks it‚Äôs 2040.
I wan him to prove he‚Äôs asked democrats supporting Biden if they get paid. He‚Äôs a liar!
It is certain the strategy is:  - Perform test run, build conservative support for fascism - Identify Battleground States - Identity (Metro) areas with potential for tipping to Joe Biden - Develop voter suppression plan - Coordinate w/fed agencies - Deploy Gestapo to suppress
What is so wrong if her future goal is to be president? Isn't that most VPs future goal? And if I'm being honest, I hope the VP would be the one running the country, not Biden. Also, isn't Biden just a 1 term president anyway? ü§îü§îü§î
You have to agree! The coverage of a "dumb" child?! By "credible" news networks never should have run it! It was done because of who he supported. Biden or Hillary hat? Non story
I had zero intentions of voting for Biden but Trump is pushing me towards it with how bad he has gotten lately
Just in time for Biden to take over and the Republicans (left) will try and blame Democrats for it all.  EVERY. DAMN. TIME.
okay instead of an election- and hear me out- trump and biden dual on the white house front lawn
üòÇü§£ Biden will be the one ducking from the debates, shit for brains
Unlike Joe Biden, who after being VP NEVER would have run for President.
Very Ron Swanson of Joe Biden to have two Tammys in his VP shortlist!
If he gets a presidential Day 1, Joe Biden has a nearly endless list of ways to spend it
Biden would have shit his pants, if he would have been in office when the oil, almost, crisis hit 4 months back. I just don't see him handling it as well as Trump. Joe may be a nice guy, but I don't see Sleepy Joe doing it. üá∫üá≤üóΩü¶Ö‚öñÔ∏èüêò
Do they think Biden is actually mentally and physically fit enough to serve two terms

Joe Biden has been the worst person for president for the last 47 years Americans already know that, given up!
I really think it‚Äôs going to be Kamala Harris as well. To me, it makes the most sense based on who Biden is. She‚Äôs def not my first choice, though
Biden‚Äôs campaign video!
I think once we get the majority in House/Senate/White House Biden is going to go full throttle to get as much done (while undoing Trump crap). He can't if Mitch is still there. Glad you are voting for her. Then we need Booker to replace Rand in 2022.

Why are you trying to project what‚Äôs happening on your watch onto Biden????
A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn‚Äôt pretty
They‚Äôve already threatened to come your way next. I wouldn‚Äôt suggest just hidin‚Äô like Biden. You may just miss it when they decide to burn your house down.

U can't call yourself a conservative if your willing to let Biden nominate SCOTUS judges.   has nominated solid  judges.  If it wasn't for the last conservative president we wouldn't have John Robert's.  The gift that keeps on giving
So you‚Äôre voting for Biden?
I wish Biden would announce his running mate so I can get a yard sign.
Definitely not voting for Biden and his criminal party after the stunts they‚Äôve pulled in 2020. So yes, Trump.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I‚Äôm not voting for either of the narcissists. No Trump, No Biden.
I am outraged that you would call trump a white supremacists. Learn some facts chump! Biden has praised Robert Byrd KKK affiliated has said poor kids are just as smart as white kids and told black voters if you don't vote for me then you ain't black
Joe Biden Mentally nuts hard to believe that he knows his name but how do you not know how your family is
Man, I hate to be a drag here but at currently 3k dead Hoosiers and climbing I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we end up being swing level like 2008. Just at the worst price. We are slightly leaning Biden in Vigo already it seems like but I don‚Äôt have numbers other than spending/vibe.
Biden for mental health evaluation
honestly worries me thinking if biden gets elected, what other trump-like person will run/possibly win after biden? and how much more dangerous than trump will they be? if obama ‚Äúcaused‚Äù trump‚Äôs presidency just imagine, what or who will biden ‚Äúcause‚Äù if he hypothetically wins?
It‚Äôs a private subdivision. Not sure he would have that authority if he wanted to, which he doesn‚Äôt. trump like destruction, not Joe Biden.
... the #OrangeMadMan is setting all of this in place, now.  When this DEGENERATE becomes the #LOSER and Joe Biden wins, *trump* is facing CRIMINAL CHARGES in New York, and he is *terrified*, ("the likes of which no one has ever seen"). LOOK UP, (GOOGLE)...  MARITAL LAW...If Biden picks anyone other than Harris at this point, it‚Äôll be his Palin moment. (Not saying either of Bass or Rice are as bad as Palin, but the pick would be just as strange and underwhelming).
Mom for Biden here. 100%
That‚Äôs exactly what he will do. Make it as difficult as possible for Joe Biden.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
Not sure which would be worse... biden, trump, or pelosi...i keep puking trying to decide.
Biden supporters are thrilled about the evictions and foreclosures. Who do you think is going to by the bloody real estate?
I will give you he is a better choice than biden but i want to see a platform.
Eisenhower was more progressive than biden. In 19fucking56...
I don‚Äôt think WI would even matter if PA, MI, AZ and FL are called for Biden.
I'm voting Biden but not because I support him. Honestly I don't think the country can handle another 4yrs of trump. I also don't think that accelerationism is going to solve everything. It's not a good strategy. I wouldn't shame people for not voting because I understand.
The Biden campaign does one of three things now: 1. Pretend like the leak never happened/deny it and announce Harris on the 1st anyway (most likely) 2. Acknowledge the leak and announce Harris tomorrow 3. Panic and announce someone else (dumb, but still a possibility)
Slow days for the CIA. They are getting sloppy. We have so screwed over Central and South America so much...i don't even have the correct words...biden will do the same just coverage or shit tweets about it.
There is no difference in trump and biden other than sound bites...war is actually more likely under a dem. At least the cheetoking is an isolationist. War is good for an economy based around the military industrial complex. It's coming...
Democrats don't care about their fellow citizens either. biden supporters are just as evil as trumpanzees.
If that were true biden won't be the nominee.
Just look at how many biden supporters think he is going to be elected and all our problems are going to disappear... Billionaires control the parties, republicans and democrats either don't care or don't understand.
Biden wrote the crime bill, helped pass the Patriot Act, and expanded the Patriot Act...you know the a lot of the reasons people are actually protesting came directly from biden's desk and mind. He said on live tv he was not going to change anything. How are you this naive?
Also nice to know that Joe Biden today is ideologically closer to Tom Tancredo than Joe Biden 12 years ago
Yeah, Biden ate Paul Ryan for breakfast. Obama was barely able to make a convincing argument against Romney. The Presidential debates were mostly statements, if not slim wins for Romney.
Plotting and planning when to dump the made up trash on Biden and how to rig voting machines.That was fast, #Biden ! Only 62 days in! Joe must have gotten cable restored in his basement. There are contestants on Big Brother more tuned in than #BasementJoe . #PortlandRiots
Alright everyone let‚Äôs just imagine it‚Äôs November and we‚Äôre sitting on the couch watching the election, and then Biden wins. Can‚Äôt wait. #SettleForBiden
Just fly a bigger Biden flag!!
The protests won't end even if Biden is the next president, fyi....
Indiana is slowly being swayed to Blue. I‚Äôm seeing a lot of Biden signs. There was always a lot of Trump, but Biden‚Äôs name is popping up everywhere I go now
If it weren‚Äôt for the fringe left, Joe Biden and George Bush are basically the same dude.  Your evolution looks more cyclical to me.
How far in advance of election can u request absentee ballot? Does it have to be after DNC convention and Biden is official nominee? Can track your ballot to make sure it is counted? I have not voted absentee before.
This is what it takes to keep the Lincoln monument safe in the #democrat controlled nations capitol today. If the people supporting #Biden win, will we even have this any more, or will #Pelosi have it removed? After all, HE was a republican too.

This is the Democratic Vice Presidential King of the Ring free for all match to determine Joe Biden's running mate this November.
What do want to bet they will be there in full force (with the aid of any needed volunteers) to serve as Security at The Presidental Debates...regardless of the location. Wouldn't want to give Joe Biden any excuse to worm wiggle out. I'm predicting a sudden illness on that day.
It's the least Joe could do for such an honest woman. Sounds like Kamala Harris has the honor of being the most "used African American" in U.S. history by the Democratic Party.  Realizing they have no chance with Joe Biden, they can use Kamala as a prop to prove Trump as racist.
Not at all. Biden at full capacity has done less good for America in 44 years in DC than trump has done in 3 years.

One huge problem with this.... law enforcement is not doing their jobs only because their democratic leaders have not allowed them to do their jobs!!
Just because she wants to express her right to vote for her president? Nah, can‚Äôt be a double standard. You would praise her for Biden. No matter which side you stand on, this is ridiculous
I will vote for Joe Biden  period
Why should  ever leave his house? Every day,  delivers new Biden campaign material. Like yesterday when he called for states to reopen despite the #TrumpVirus still raging. It's clear  has lost contact with reality.
All the things you predict for Biden are actually happening under your watch.
There would be expanded coverage to dental, vision and mental health. In short no Part B, D. Of course I assume you aren't an ins. employee fronting for the boss. Biden will win and if nobody applies pressure you'll still be paying for 1 big colonoscopy.

Perpetuates the myth. "A fair shot for all" is what our country was built on. But people like #Biden  (Dems) can't let that happen or they'd lose power over you. They actually think this way, which is why all their programs entrench problems instead of solve them.

It‚Äôs like he hasn‚Äôt been in government for nearly 50 years. Biden is same thing different day.
Social media has become the target of a dueling attack ad campaign being waged online by the sitting president and his election rival --
Joe Biden is NOT radical left. His brain is failing. His policies caused decades of needless pain on #WorkingFamilies and exploded the private prison industry.  But Joe is NOT radical left Mr President.
Well, that is better than waking up and finding out Biden is POTUS.

You have that mixed up it was Biden
You do not know anything about Trump. You have never met him and you have never been around him. You know nothing. Why didn't you read anything about Obama/Biden and Russia? Because the media didn't make it a story. You are being played.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Not flagged for his attention. Do you understand what that means? And again, why didn't Biden and Obama do anything about it? What do you want Trump to do, start a war?
Yes, unverified info goes into the report. Again, the same bounty went on under Obama Biden. What did they do? Even Iran had bounties on US troops. What did Obama and Biden do? Do you want Trump to bomb Russia?
The info wasn't provided to Trump. It was never verified just as it was never verified under Obama. It was also going on under Biden and Obama. What did they do? Do you understand the report that this was in?
Biden is a decent person, with loads of experience. He has overwhelming Black support. Years of foreign affairs diplomacy under his belt.  Not a saint. And perhaps not as revolutionary as we deserve; he certainly has the experience we need.  I‚Äôm getting excited, actually.
Florida, more than anywhere, is experiencing the ramifications of Trump‚Äôs ineptitude. Biden is the only choice. #BidenForFL
Trump was elected imo largely as an up-yours to politics as usual in Washington DC. Which makes Biden,  a lifelong insider, a particularly bad option.

Biden could smoke crack from a hookers crack pipe and I‚Äôd still find a way to vote for him twice.

I have my reasons for not wanting to vote Trump. It‚Äôs not necessarily that I actually want to vote for Biden or anybody else for that matter. I just really don‚Äôt want to vote for Trump.
A vote for Joe Biden is a vote to lose all our freedom
I mean did you not see the tax plan and climate plan that Biden released. Trump said he was gonna unveil a republican healthcare plan 4 years ago. If anything Trump is twiddling his thumbs (this should in no way be taken as a Biden endorsement)
But at the end of the day, she has all the right opinions, and policy stances. But I guess you‚Äôd prefer Biden/Trump in 24. Stop letting stupid shit like this destroy the left, and just leave it up to the policy.
You‚Äôre right but if we are being 100% fair. At the beginning of the Biden campaign, even his staffers were saying they were attempting to run a campaign of ‚ÄúLimited exposure ‚Äú which up to this point has kept Biden out of the news cycle, letting Trump just take all the heat.
Listening to your big money donors is what disqualifies you as a candidate Joe.  Biden's communications team is REALLY bad at twitter.  #GetMoneyOut #MedicareForAll Costs LESS than the US pays now #FightFor15 because no one with a full time job should be living in poverty

I'm pretty sure Obama doesn't know what bringing people together means. All he and Biden did was to divide people.
