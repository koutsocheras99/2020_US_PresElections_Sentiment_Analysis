Why? Because Joe Biden doesn't know how to tweet. Jill probably did this for him!

The reason fof thd increace i covid cases is be cause most hospitalboardmembers are Democrats leftist. Just like the lady doctor fired be cause she was svacated oxycontindine because it might look bad for biden.
Yes I do believe Biden has dementia! Over the years as a Delaware native have met him in social settings! This is not the man I knew n respected! My question is where is his family! Why is his wife n son allows Biden to continue! Elder abuse! Is this all about money? Joe is over!
You‚Äôre really gonna talk about dementia when you support Biden. Go to bedüòÇ
I wonder what war Biden will start. Not going to be China or Iran, something they won‚Äôt be completely embarrass the country.
I wonder if when they have the debates, will the candidates talk about what they will do to help this country (Biden)or will one of them(Trump)just talk about nothing because he knows Nothing?ü§î
Frankly i dont understand the 'defund police'..situation  Except it seems to be a question of redistributing the funds...but how exactly ? i dunno. And btw Biden doesn't go along with it  (Despite trump and most of his supporters claming he does)
First of all you really need to work on your grammar. Second, Trump will win easily! Biden has 247 people watching his virtual ‚Äúrally‚Äù today lmaoo

Delaware! Home of the famous Biden Basement.
Biden had a senior moment and condemned anarchy and lawlessness in Portland. His party is now going berserk. No worries. He will come around. This buffoon is easy to manipulate and control; it's why they picked him.
Trump policies are helping Texas economy recover, while Biden would crush energy jobs
BULLSHIT. And they know it. They are counting on vote-by-mail to steal the election. And if demented Joe Biden ends up in the White House, you can be sure that millions of us will NOT consider him legitimate. They will learn what REAL resistance looks like.

Mass incarceration of minorities hopefully is slowly changing.  Biden‚Äôs choice of a black woman running mate should help move that along.
I get that, however, I realize that Biden will not be above the law.  His family will not run our country.  Trump‚Äôs actions scare me.  Trumps disrespect and enjoyment for violence aren‚Äôt ok with me.

You have lost your moral compass,...if you even had one. Joe Biden is a corrupt thief.
Joe Biden accuses President Trump of stoking racial tensions throughout the country and slams his handling of COVID, says Trump has a duty to care for the entire country, not just his re-election prospects.
Biden speaks about racism.
At Joe Biden event waiting on him to speak on his racial economy equity plan. The scoreboard is appropriately themed

What a worthless piece of human garbage  is.
Election popular vote went to Hillary.  Polls have Biden up by 10 points.  Even Fox news calls Biden leading.  And that's all called "fake news".  And you think Twitter represents the population...  Who exactly is in that echo chamber you speak of? üòÇ
These are the same people that lose the popular vote, and cry like little babies about voter fraud.  The polls with Biden 10 points ahead as fake.  And the medium-ish inauguration crowds as "the biggest ever".  Remember, they only count the uneducated white male demographic.
You want to know how racism is at play here. Elizabeth Warren told Joe Biden he was running in the wrong primary, but she has never been asked about it. Different standard for black women. Kamala attacked his policies..Warren attacked him.
Let's move Obama &amp; Biden
All I see is Biden
Getting Biden elected is gonna stop the hemorrhaging. Nothing more. We have a long road ahead of us to fix this country no matter who wins.
Could not Biden engage former FDA Commissioners and the like to establish the criteria and validation procedures?
Ok! 2 less to vote for Biden!
Lou don't you believe pelosi schummer and others were in this with obama biden they new they wanteded Biden to run in 2020
They can move out if they don‚Äôt like it here in America! China owns the Democrats!! They‚Äôre all bought and paid for from Biden on down
Sad,but, he was better in his younger days. It was sad that he didn‚Äôt try to Unite but rather wanted to divide. Civil Rights leaders, for all, not just for Byrd, Biden and HRC followers.
The bottom line is there are no bad choices among the top tier. And it doesn't matter as long as Biden doesn't pick the Democratic equivalent of Palin. That said, mostly disagree on Kamala, although your point about her measuring the drapes of the Oval on day one is a good point
Joe biden in his stupid campain add  says he would lisen to theexperts we kw he will only lisen to what bernie sanders and the left tellming to doTrump has lisened tomost experts doring the covid most were wrong and Trump saved millions of lives by lisening to his gut instinct
Every minarity voter joebiden thought the Democrats had in the bag now none of them want biden at all.
Kamala - "She knew Biden was racist because he is. I am the greatest president for black people with the exception of Lincoln" Warren - "Pocahantos is a radical socialist" Rice - "Benghazi!" "Deep state!" Bass - "Radical leftist on the side of rioters" Duckworth - ???

Hidin‚Äô Biden has good reason to stay in the basement and read onto TV videos whatever the teleprompter tells him to say. He is being protected from public scrutiny. But who‚Äôs going to protect the public if Biden gets elected?
It‚Äôs not as if Obama and Biden had left office after 8 years with an adequate national testing policy in place that Trump dismantled. The Democrats did nothing. And all they do now is obstruct and complain, while in fact rates of testing are at an all time high.
Delaware though Biden will probably win. The people aren't bipartisan anymore &amp; usually vote a strict Democrat ticket. We had a better mix of parties when we moved here in '85.

VOTE RED! Biden and the Democrats are nothing but trouble.
They would have to have a screw loose to vote for Biden. That would be like giving the Democrats your user name and password for your bank account!
Communist Biden Democrats support Black Lives Matter. They also want guns banned and citizens disarmed. So where do Communist Biden Democrats stand on armed Black Lives Matter "protesters" threatening people with guns? We know the answer, don't we?

Biden is here. I just drove by his house in North Shores and there were secretive service on golf carts and blacked out and bullet proofed Cadillac SUV's. Activity here is definitely high at the Biden home.

It‚Äôs a beautiful thing when politicians empathize with the people. Joe Biden is so empathetic that he feels the pain of the rioters, the looters, and the anarchists. Trump feels the pain of their victims. I‚Äôd vote for Joe as my therapist and Trump as my President.

Biden is better on a moral level and I agree with your point but it‚Äôs always a battle of the lesser evil, they‚Äôre both obviously idiots or unfit and in Trump‚Äôs case both.
Biden wants to fix the police, he doesn't want to abolish or defund them.  I know your constituents are full blown idiots, but lying to them in order to scare them, and in turn, secure their votes for you, seems a little fucked up.   You're taking advantage of their stupidity.

literally the most comforting thing biden has ever said
He told Biden he will never be President.  Meltdown
I think Trump just told biden He will never be president.  Is that a threat?
They have effectively put Biden in a position where if he doesn't pick her everyone will assume it was because she was too "uppity."  Unless he already has decided it's her he needs to tamp this down personally or it is going to cost him a lot of volunteers.  #BidenHarris2020

Adam, my fear is Trump's October surprise will be garbage trying to tie the Biden's to the Epstein debacle.
I misinterpreted your tweet. I look forward to Biden being rhe President.  He may not be perfect and he is getting up there in age but we need to stop this insanity before it‚Äôs too late.
This country is a disaster! Please hurry and get in office our next President Biden !

Of course not you will be too busy padding the nest for Hunter Biden and the rest of your family! So tell me Joe when will you answer questions about your son Hunter and all the deals he made with other countries?
This what Trump and his campaign team should be doing if they are serious about winning the election, instead of falsely attacking Former Vice President Joe Biden and the peaceful protests, focus more on combating the Coronavirus and the COVID 19 disease with actual facts.

I need someone in the press, helpfully not a prominent democrat, someone trump hates...Scarborough? To start calling Joe Biden President-Elect Biden. Just to piss trump off every day and increase the chance of him losing it on live tv.
Did I say Biden was perfect? Also Trump was friends with Epstein and wished Ghislane Maxwell well in her trial if you want to go there.
I have been with Joe Biden many times- in person- at weddings- when you are with him- THERE is NOTHING CREEPY about him- he is just an old fashioned pop pop that kisses babies.
Really? That was it? Withholding aid from Ukraine for dirt on Biden didn't do it for you?

Do not underestimate the depths to which Trump will go until January 20. Not November 3, JANUARY 20.  If he's voted out and doesn't find a way to stay there, my bet is on Biden actually being 47, not 46 -- after Trump resigns in late January to Pence to get himself a full pardon.

Ali, serious question. Without saying anything about Trump can you please tell me why someone should vote for Biden? The only reason anyone has ever given me is "because he isn't Trump"...
I'm exhausted with the same old topics..so lets agree on the following facts.  The media is in the bag for the D's, Biden has a mental disorder, the D's want chaos, massive taxes, no police, open boarders, socialism, cultural obedience and control.  Pls tweet about something new!
That‚Äôs ok with us. She‚Äôll be an asset to Biden and a good first female president when Joe is finished being president.
Calling the video ‚Äúfake‚Äù is all the evidence I need to conclude that you‚Äôre a clown. Pre pandemic or not Biden‚Äôs helpers/family don‚Äôt want him to be in front of a camera talking for too long.
Biden doesn't know how to fix anything or he would have done so over 45 years.  He was literally on the wrong side of every issue for 4 decades...one actually has to try hard to be that dumb...amazing.  Biggest Idiot Dems Ever Nominated.

Are they really telling former Vice President now candidate for President Joe Biden to be cautious in picking a Vice President who may want to run for President?
Does Biden even know who she is?
She would be the President day one because Biden can not do it
Stop spreading fake news, you are going to get Biden elected. Do you really want to go back to the neoliberal swamp?
No doubt.  PA was never gonna go to Biden, the pro-fracking stance didn't help- he alienated the environmentalists and farmers that might've voted for him.
Why are you a Republican supporting Biden? #RepublicansForBiden
Besides making a great pillow...Mike makes alot of sense.  Honestly you have to have no Critical Thinking skills whatsoever to vote for what Biden represents....chaos, no police, open boarders, GND, Socialism.  A vote for Biden is signing America's death warrant it's that simple
Who else thinks the media will forget about Covid if Biden wins?
Dementia is a cruel affliction.  When you see Biden squint his eyes very tight he's struggling with an episode of confusion and focus loss at that moment.  Beside being totally irresponsible for his party to use him in this way.  It's CRAZY SCARY for all of us if he were to win!!
Well, the good news is that if Biden is up big in MI, PA, AZ, then he doesn't need WI.

Uhm, except that Biden is the very definition of a centrist candidate and he and the Dem Party have rejected most of what us "radical leftists" want. Of course, he's better than the disaster in office now, but Biden is no hero of the true progressives.

In January, Biden warned us of exactly what is happening.  You‚Äôre the worst leader in our countries history and you‚Äôll fail with the covid 19 crisis. He said, IN JANUARY, ‚Äúit‚Äôs serious‚Äù.  You failed, trump. Resign!
Why does the video start with her in custody. What led up to that? Even Joe Biden said these folks must be held accountable.

Trump owed 27 million to Bank Of China,  rumor is he still owes more than 100 million to Bank of China, owned by the Chinese government and to Russia aka Putin.  Trump was impeached.  Senate republicans didn‚Äôt do their job. They‚Äôll pay 11-3-20!
Biden isn‚Äôt the president........ yet!   He‚Äôll legalize it by Decriminalizing it.
The fact is that you turn a blind eye when it comes to sexual assault allegations about Joe Biden, but you don‚Äôt care because your asinine hatred of Trump is more important.

Biden's economic plan is Trump's plan. Is there no limit to what Biden will plagurize?
watch Biden presser. He outlined his plan. It is identical to Trump's plan from 2016 which most has been completed. Joe wants to bring steel back to the USA. Um, Joe, that happened in 2017.  Is there anything Joe won't plagurize?

You‚Äôre whistling in the dark here, Brit.   The silent majority is now the silent majority for Biden.   We see and admit our mistake.   Trumps a disaster, he can‚Äôt lead.
In this moment, we have the chance to build an economy where everyone gets a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead. One more vibrant and more powerful because everyone is in on the deal.  Here's how we'll do it:

You insulted Joe Biden and some people on the left. Being mean on twitter is illegal now, so you're in big trouble, mister.
Love u man but this is about settling for Biden because he‚Äôs our only choice that isn‚Äôt the clown that‚Äôs been in office for the past four years.
Part of me wants to say "how could Trump get reelected after seeing *motions at everything in general*" but I've seen enough to not ask that anymore. Biden has my vote, though Bernie had my preference.

Not true maybe you should listen to what Biden has said, It absolutely all true. Biden has been in office for forty years. Name one thing he has done. But your correct on what the the media won't report. Trump has done more in 3 years then Biden in 40
Joe Biden's plan sound an awful like what Trump is doing or done.

Just know, that me, Joe Biden, will never forget or stop working for the 150,000 families I rip healthcare away from.  Our country needs its soul back.  So I will excise the necessary blood-letting from those less fortunate!
women have been doing fine with or without Biden!!!! pppppleeeaassssss you are not that important or smart!!!! without you we still are great regardless
FWIW: At this point I do not give a single damn who Biden picks for VP, because all the choices are good choices. The options are an embarrassment of riches I hope will be tapped for the cabinet as well.
Just got an email from Biden saying to join him and Warren on Friday for a chat. I really hope it‚Äôs not to announce Warren as VP.

I just have an observation, If Biden is ahead in the polls.  Why don't I ever see anything like this for him? Maybe cause it's bull, they wanna discourage you from voting with polls, Also if they managed to steal it with mail-in voting you won't question the results
Biden is mentally unfit to walk to the bathroom alone.
I sure hope Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt pick you for Vice President and if he does it‚Äôs rigged by the Democrat Party. Remember what you said ‚ÄúThat little girl was me‚Äù yep that‚Äôs what you said to Biden on stage. I seen you at the Kavanaugh hearings (sick) smoked pot! Willie?
The D's are smart enough to know that hiding him is the only chance they have.  Biden is a train wreck on many levels.  Almost 100% of the media functions as a PR firm for the D's so they can say/do almost anything and get away with it.  America is in trouble!
Take it to the bank - no one actually believes Joe Biden will be the POTUS. Either he loses and isn‚Äôt the POTUS. Or he wins, and STILL isn‚Äôt the POTUS. He‚Äôs the POTUS in name only. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre sitting on this VP pick.

Biden wants to take more, we have to pay for free health care, college, open borders. Then he talking about flat base pay for most people. If you work at wendy's your pay will be the same as the welder, electrician , nurse.

The hard truth is women ‚Äî and particularly women of color ‚Äî have never had a fair shot to get ahead in this country. That's why today, I'm releasing my plan to make sure women can fully participate in our economy and country.
Remember the outrage when the Secret Service made the decision to put Trump in the bunker when people threatened to storm the White House? Biden lives in a private mansion with no one around and there‚Äôs no outrage that he won‚Äôt speak to the public. Imagine that.
What's extra dumb about this is that Biden and Obama got into it in the debates, too -- and still got along famously when it came to governing and working as a team. So there's even precedent for Biden specifically not stressing this sort of thing, which is laudable.
Reminder: 3 big reasons Democrats want to keep America shut down   1. Mail-in ballots so they can cheat.   2. Keep cognitive decline, Joe Biden, OFF the campaign trail.  3. Continue to trash the economy and blame President Trump.
Trump doesn't need saving. The only way in hell Biden could ever win is to steal it. That why the Dems Are so set on mail-in votes
The hard truth is this pandemic didn‚Äôt have to be this bad. Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, breaks down what a Biden administration would have done differently and what we would do now to get this virus under control:
Why is it Biden‚Äôs running mate has not been announced?
Regarding this dumbass Chris Dodd article. It's July 27th, Biden's said he's announcing his pick on August 1st. He already knows who his VP is gonna be. This is either a poorly thought out red herring or a poorly thought out hit piece from someone that didn't get what he wanted.
I‚Äôm not a fan of this idea that Trump just won‚Äôt leave the White House if Biden is elected, but the image of him being escorted out by the feds would look awesome in history textbooks.
The optics of demanding an apology from a black woman who challenged Biden are terrible and are already hurting him.  You need to resign.
I hope everyone takes that info seriously. We need to vote like Biden is down by 20 points. It must be a landslide defeat of Trump... it‚Äôs the only way he might concede.

Mail-in voting is part of our election process and will continue to be so. In reality, we know that you want in person voting bc the Biden voters care about the health of all whereas your voters couldn‚Äôt give 2 shits.
Sane people are against fracking because we need water more than we need oil. PA and the rest of the USA for Biden all the way.

You are as crazy as Trump! Biden would be a hell of lot better than Trump I can tell you that! At least he can speak and knows what he is saying unlike Trump! Stop watching the commercials Trump is putting out and wake up! Trump is a buffoon and such a liar ü§•
The only reason anyone will vote for Biden is because they have no candidate to vote for. Same story as Hillary. The DNC care more about keeping the machine oiled than being in power, or doing anything about the problems the left have identified over the last few decades.
So, In this speech Biden stayed that he learned about the black community by working as a lifeguard at an inner city pool.  It was the when he learned about roaches amongst other things...
How is Biden any better than Trump?
Yup.  I've noticed this.  They wouldn't have voted for Biden 20 years ago...   wtf.

Till the election, you think huh? I beg to differ if Biden gets elected it will not stop. Why would it? There winning now. You just won't hear about it the media won't report on it. What will happen is open borders, free everything, No police, and a war on Trump supporters.
There is something truly upsetting about Trump supporters as they describe ‚Äúhow bad it will be under Biden‚Äù: They are typically obese, look/sound ill, dressed slovenly, deeply ignorant &amp; uneducated... and this, after 3.5 years, during a pandemic, depression, and national unrest.

Both, and more. Biden has no problem surrounding himself with knowledgeable and competent people and allowing them to do their jobs. Unlike someone else we know.
Biden, when his children were in school, didn‚Äôt think the black kids should be able to get busing to white schools.  He didn‚Äôt want his kids school to turn into ‚Äúa jungle, a racial jungle‚Äù.

The unity committee that has been working on transition policy is indeed supporting a progressive agenda. Bernie himself is optimistic about Biden's policy direction.
There is no leftist group in the US. Republicans are conservative and Democrats are conservative-moderate. Both groups are heavily corrupted by lobbyist. I believe both Trump and Biden are just as bad. American politics is a trash heap.

But that's my point- I don't think he's the slightly less terrible one. A vote for Biden is a vote for the world that let Trump grow and thrive. A vote for Biden is a vote to fund and militarize the police. A vote for Biden is a vote for fossil fuels, corporations, capitalism.
Joe Biden walks in the room to finger you, do you consent?  Plot twist... It doesn't matter.
And this concerns me: "...if Joe Biden sticks to..."  You know he had to drop out of previous presidential runs because of blatant lies, right?  He even consistently lies about how his wife died. I mean....  the man is proven to be dishonest.
Biden has the opportunity to speak up about COVID now, he doesn't have to wait until he's elected- what's he doing about it?   Biden has decades of legislative power/experience behind him- why has he done nothing for the environment in all those years?  Why is he for fracking?

They have pointed to pictures of Biden tapping a child on the shoulder and called it 'groping'. The distortion is horrible, whether it's that they're so twisted up that they believe that's what they're seeing, or they're just shamelessly spewing ugliness.
If the country shut down America and it people will suffer.   The is a true dictator government and the democrat will do anything to put Biden in office the man who will destroy  America.  Joe Biden the white Obama.  (wherethenewsis com)
Biden was  also in supporter of the "3 Strikes Your Out law" during Bill Clinton's term

No it‚Äôs for sure trump. Clinton Unser Obama repopend the case when she saw how dirty it was by the DA in Florida, Acosta. He resigned in 08 because of it and case was opened in NY after Florida under Obama, Biden.  Acosta was put on trumps admin and later resigned, because of it
You sound ridiculous. She's a goofball dancing with flowers.
I'd say the entire postal union endorsing Biden is a bigger problem but what do I know?
She's on the outside of the fence.
She is in a crosswalk on a public street.
Don't believe your lying eyes, amirite...
This is desperation in its purest form. Biden is kicking the shit out of you in the polls, double digit leads in all key states per  polls, you are so fucked. You‚Äôre losing BAD, can‚Äôt change course and recover by acting like you care about COVID now you #assclownostrich
4 years of Biden‚Äôs bullshit will be better than Trump, then we gotta get someone REAL in there. They can be a Rep, Dem or an I. They just need to be the best candidate for the job
Biden never knows who he is.  That‚Äôs the problem. It‚Äôs more complicated than a split personality.
The Biden campaign has an ad in rotation that promises New Morning in America.   I think it will impress Democrats who are not pricing U-Hauls out of CHI, MPLS, SEA, POR, NYC etc.
Biden is mentally incompetent
Your fear of Joe Biden and the Democrats who support him is irrational and leads you to support people who, in your words, "If Trump were a more competent authoritarian, their cowardice might have been lethal." (The GOP were lethal in their support of Trump's bad COVID policy.)

Karen Bass doesn't want her picture taken. Yet she's suddenly on Biden's VP shortlist.  via
Biden is NOT ahead in the battleground states.  I grew up in PA and have worked in the other states.  People there are rational, common sense folks who believe in America. They will not vote for Lawlessness, Socialism, GND etc.  Polls had Hillary up 13 points the day of election.
I see so many people out getting guns now for self defence but they fail to understand that the Government now keeps track of every gun sale. That is right now they can come take your weapons any time they please. And lets not forget Biden said he going to disarm America!
Trunk is the first Nazi, Fascist, racist president.  Biden is right on.   He just forgot a few words.  We all knew what he meant.
Do you think maybe Trump knows he is going to lose so now he‚Äôs trying to screw the country up so bad he‚Äôs trying to make it worse for Biden?  Like this China thing is gonna escalate fast and China ain‚Äôt scared!
Democrats told Biden to stop being so touchy feely.  He went on live tv, faced his accuser, apologized. It has stopped. Republicans don‚Äôt seem to ever stand up against their long list of pedophiles, sex traffickers.  In fact the president wishes them, ‚Äúwell‚Äù ü§Æü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí©ü§°ü§Æ
Did trump wish a pedophile sex trafficker, ‚Äúwell‚Äù.  Why yes he did twice.  Biden never said anything about the Muslim religion being taught in school.  We should learn however about other cultures.

I don't disagree on certain of your viewpoints. But...I bet Biden wasn't your first choice after the primaries and the debates. Be honest. He may the "easy choice," and a winning candidate but you can't say he's everyone's first choice. He clearly was not.
...Probably not because it isn't reasonable. I wish Mr. Biden would just own his conflicts and his mistakes. He's 78 years old and probably has made a few. But instead he denies any knowledge of anything and in doing so, treats the public like they are idiots. Just saying...
Biden can promise the word origin, does not think passing a simple test for dental makes him a genius and does not think Windmills cause cancer.
Biden spoke at his eulogy.  Obama spoke highly of him as well.
The word "disappointed" is not found anywhere in the Politico article. I have never said I was disappointed Biden wasn't charged. I said Mr. Biden lacks integrity for not admitting his and his campaign's involvement in the bundled contributions.
I. Will. Vote. For. Biden. #CognitiveTestChallenge
I'm not joking. I predict Biden pulls out and Killary is his replacement.
He‚Äôs the only one that will keep America as we know it since his birth if Biden is elected we will lose all democracy that we know so please get out and vote do you want to be under a tyrant or president??ü§î
Tucker was probably the funniest I've ever seen his show tonight. "If you've blown in Joe Biden's mouth, we want you to come on this show and tell your tale. You deserve to have your trauma heard."

Obama Biden took over the greatest collapse in US history. 9-15-08 They pulled us out. Set a record for job growth in a fiscal year 10,000,000 He handled the textron deal, Cessna, Beechcraft &amp; Reythion. It added 150,000 manucturing jobs. In that deal textron saved aircraft jobs.
The worst thing about a Biden Presidency is Jerry Van Dyke isn‚Äôt alive to do an impression of him on late night tv. Some people will get this.
Wow! This is under 45's administration... Not Biden's.
Yep. They'll all be voting for Biden. That is if trump and the R's stopped asking for foreign interference in our elections.
This is disgusting and a sign of what's yet to come if Biden wins.
I just signed a  petition to  and  calling on them to include ending marijuana prohibition in their campaign platforms. Sign here:
They elect MPs like we do. But then have head to head for President. Just a 2 horse race.  This will be in November and at moment it is Trump v Biden  Sometimes a 3rd person throws their hat in. But no sign yet
Biden could shoot me on my front lawn and I'd still vote for him at this point.
In July of 1988 Dukakis was leading George HW Bush by 17 points.  Bush won in a landslide!  It will happen again....only a true crazy radical can possibly vote for Biden. All R's and most common sense thinking D's and I's will vote for Trump.  Guaranteed!
Joe Biden is one of them.
Fascinating photo--no attribution. Looks like a stock photo. Appropriate. DJT lives in a Stock Photo World that does not exist. Someone could do an intense analysis of the visual signs and codes.  BTW, Biden has said nothing about the suburbs. More lying.
YOU'RE currently in the process of destroying neighborhoods across the country AND the "American Dream". You're violating constitutional rights daily.  Biden will put an end to your insanity.  BTW, the only time you really care about women is when you're sexually assaulting them.
Biden will not pick a BLACK LADY. Democrats are full of deceit when its blacks issue.  knows they believe any lie and still follow them
Im with you guys 100% but  honestly what Biden said in 1981 means nothing in 2020. You dont need to do that shit!! You guys should be better than that.

Be sure to ask Biden why he didn‚Äôt want integrated busing because he didn‚Äôt want his children to go to school in a ‚Äúracial jungle‚Äù.
He has not agenda. Biden is simply a host for the radical left.
The election is in less than 4 months. If you're actively tearing down Biden at every chance you get, you are a Trump supporter at this point. And would he have been even my first ten choices? No. But he certainly isn't Trump.
To all of the Biden supporters and Trump haters who responded to my tweet, I understand your position but don‚Äôt agree. Have a safe dayüò∑
Right which is why Biden wants to get them more money. Sounds like a good plan to me.
COVID-19 has affected so many aspects of college students' lives like internships and experiential learning. Check out this postcard from  student Meilyn who is assisting  with research to combat the pandemic.   More info here:
Umm. This is happening now because of the fat ass wannabe preside. Biden will pull federal troops not send them against American citizens.
LMAO  You do know there are term limits, right? I mean, Obama couldn't run again even if he wanted to. Which, btw, was good for you, because you never would've beat him.  And hell, a shit ton of Republicans are endorsing Biden over you.  Go take a nap pappy.
I don't believe that Pennsylvania number. With Biden wanting to end fracking and him supporting the green new deal has turned PA off from him.
I don‚Äôt think it is right for politicians, including Joe Biden, to solicit campaign contributions that they know are in violation of the law. I think Joe and his people should have said, ‚Äúmake sure you comply with the fundraising statute. It is...‚Äù How is that not reasonable?
Pandemic is a good point - I don't think many protesters at all would vote Biden. It'll be another close run for sure, but I feel like Trump has the right locked down, and Biden has very little of the left on side, same as Clinton before.
HE'S NOT RACIST AND HE'S NOT STUPID LIKE YOU ARE BIDEN. ...
Honestly WHAT if Joe Biden died right now

Yes it is because the mayors won't do their damn jobs.  Just like Biden wouldn't.  Pretty simple concept.

Unlikely. Trump gets fringe voters on the right, Biden gets none on the left. Another close election, but Trump steals it with his outliers. Same as happened with Clinton. No-one wanted her warmongering bullshit so the radicals stayed home on the day.
