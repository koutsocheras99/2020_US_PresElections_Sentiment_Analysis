Thanks for having me,  I‚Äôm glad to see  working to level the playing field for Black farmers. We can #BuildBackBetter together.
Fuck yeah guess I'm voting for Biden  BLOOD AND CHAOS 2020
Good, but let‚Äôs stay consistent and ban all racists. Including Joe Biden!
Best column I've seen in a while: "Before Mr. Biden‚Äôs transformation, the question facing voters was 'Do you support Donald Trump?' The question now is, 'Are you willing to endanger the economy and your freedom to end the Trump presidency?'‚Äù via
You did not seriously think the DNC would let Biden appear in public for an extended period? What if he had to have a conversation, or even change his diaper?
Well, Joe Biden can still have rally‚Äôs!
why do you never talk about Joe Biden , always talking about Trump it‚Äôs not funny ....
Imagine not voting for trump because he‚Äôs racist and sexist and turning around to vote for Biden. It‚Äôs just silly at this point.
you gonna apologize to Biden now?
THERE IS NO DEBATE!!!
I remember when Obama said just a few months ago that Joe Biden just doesn‚Äôt have (IT)! But I guess Joes it must have been COVID 19! So now Obama backs sleepy Joe üò¥!
It‚Äôs ridiculous considering how many runs Joe Biden made.
Since Biden has clearly said he will be in office most likely one term, Harris as VP opens her up  for President for the next two terms and that scares the crap out of them. A female POC as POTUS!! This is a polite way of telling her to stay in her place!
I believe Biden will take NC. Not sure on GA yet.
The Black woman is "too ambitious" for daring to run for POTUS once. Meanwhile, Biden unsuccessfully ran for POTUS multiple times before Obama picked him and was never once referred to as "too ambitious"
LMAO that Joe Biden is advertising on my YouTube channel for my new song "Welfare Worker" You can't make this S up!   #Merica #MAGA2020 #TrumpTrain
I don‚Äôt know about the rest of you Taxpayers but Joe Biden wants to Forgive Collage Loans for the very people who are Burning our Country Flag and Toppling History. Not ME !!!
We‚Äôre dealing with an existential threat right now known as Donald Trump. Whether it‚Äôs Biden, Sanders or Warren, it will take either one a while to clean up the mess. We‚Äôre gonna play catch-up with the pandemic for months. That has to be addressed before we can do anything else.
I wanted someone that would push an agenda like FDR and that person was Warren.   Now that she is outta the race - let me say this, and knowing first hand directly the dysfunction with this administration   Biden would get us back to having a functional government
2/Biden will, at least, deliver some goods, even if it‚Äôs not all of what we want. He also won‚Äôt allow the pandemic to go unchecked.
1/That‚Äôs what they don‚Äôt seem too get. Biden sounds more progressive now than I thought he would. Yes, I rather he be a Sanders/Warren progressive, and I want corporate money out of politics, but we‚Äôll get absolutely none of what we want with Trump.
A vote for anyone other than Biden is a vote for Trump.
As the fourth pillar of Joe Biden‚Äôs Build Back Better Agenda, he is announcing how he will make a direct investment to advance racial equity as part of our nation‚Äôs economic recovery. Learn more:
I have to. I didn‚Äôt use any of those tropes. I understand that non stop negative backfires. LP CAN do this so let‚Äôs try to have perspective is my point.  For what reason do Dems listen? They are already voting Biden. My point. These are vanity exercises ... good ones.. but.
With fewer than 100 days until the presidential election, presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden has announced he will choose his running mate next week.
I really wish Joe Biden was who Trump‚Äôs tweets say he is.
I‚Äôm Joe Biden and I approve this message.
Biden is anyone's choice? They will only win by cheating so Trump supporters have to show up100 times stronger to make up for it.
Biden's notes: ‚ÄòDo not hold grudges‚Äô against Kamala Harris
Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, said Tuesday he would name his running mate during the first week of August.
Biden vows to fight racial inequalities with economic agenda
Biden says he will choose his running mate next week
Ha! As compared to President Trump‚Äôs? I can‚Äôt stand him but I doom watch his pressers because of the inevitable meltdown. I can‚Äôt wait to ignore President Biden‚Äôs!
You can have Biden in office for a short period of time until his short-term memory is totally gone and enjoy a tax hike - maybe 40%.
What caused that drop?  Hasn‚Äôt it rebounded a couple of times?  Vote for Biden and enjoy a tax increase.
Biden is too senile to sell lemonade on a corner stand.
Please change the animal - maybe a jackal or an hyena would be better. Why? I have &amp; love my cats, and they are protesting at being associated in ANY way with Biden!
If they don‚Äôt find another location then Trump should hold a rally and either debate a empty chair or put a Biden mannequin in it. Same difference.
Great strategy you ask me. Let trump keep sticking his foot in his mouth and displaying his incompetence. Biden's political career speaks for itself, good or bad. By now, people have made up their minds about both candidates. You either want stability or more chaos.
Me! Mississippi and Ridin with Biden.
This is one where Biden friendship loyalty burned him I think. There were far better ‚Äúold white guy Senate dudes‚Äù to pick.
If Democrats put Vote For Biden or similar on masks, it might be a way to get Republicans to wear masks.   Masks with Vote For Trump on them, or similar, but still, masks.

AP-NORC poll: Anxiety props up Biden, Trump voters fervent
The Democrats / swamp / use these old guys as puppets and prop them up to support what ever leftist agenda they have.   Biden will be a masterclass is puppetry.
Biden has big cognitive issues. He is an adult. He just has a hard time thinking for himself so the Democratic Party is thinking for him.
Biden‚Äôs people are tired and stressed. But resolved. Payday is coming. 99 days.
The Pope would vote for Biden. A vote otherwise makes you a Trump supporter and massive racist.
With the November election 100 days away, more Americans say the country is heading in the wrong direction than at any previous point in Donald Trump‚Äôs presidency as his reelection bid against Democrat Joe Biden enters a pivotal stretch.
Biden did receive deferments from draft; but, the selective service declared Biden unavailable for service due to asthma, a real medical condition.
That‚Äôs just so WRONG. I can‚Äôt imagine what the cops will do when Biden gets elected ! If that brings you any good thoughts. #100DaysToGo
Biden Will Destroy the Suburbs
What I keep going back to is that poll where Trump has 49% white support and Biden 42%. If white ‚Äúundecideds‚Äù swing for Trump, that‚Äôs the same 58% he had in 2016. So I‚Äôm still concerned.
I don‚Äôt think Mr Biden would ever agree to an interview, especially by a seasoned pro like Chris Wallace...
Mark, are you supporting Biden?
With the November election 100 days away, more Americans say the country is heading in the wrong direction than at any previous point in Donald Trump‚Äôs presidency as his reelection bid against Democrat Joe Biden enters a pivotal stretch.

Obama did not make America great again. He apologized for America. He wasn‚Äôt a patriot. He was a globalist and right now Biden is a puppet.
What makes an opinion stupid? And you think Trump or Biden are mentally able to lead a nation?

Joe Biden‚Äôs video clip from 2006 needs to be played and replayed.
Y'all *don't* let Joe Biden fall into this fool's trap... let him keep believing he's intelligent
Maybe Joe Biden was right all along?
If black aunties say Biden then it's Biden.  I'll deal.
the gag of it all is, I'm a card carrying dues paying member of DSA but Bernie lost me for several reasons.  This whole eff Biden let the world burn crap is so priviledged and ignores what BLACK WOMEN have said at the polls, in writing ect.  I didn't want him but the aunties did.
I don't know why you're in my mentions talking about Biden. He's been called out repeatedly about these things especially by abortion funds so I fail to see what point you're attempting to make?
Y'all do let Joe Biden fall into this fool's trap... let him keep believing he's intelligent
‚ÄúI aced it. I aced the test,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúI guarantee you that Joe Biden could not answer those questions, and I answered all 35 questions correctly."

"Joe Biden has outraised the president for two consecutive months, and there are growing concerns among senior Republicans about whether the dysfunction within Guilfoyle‚Äôs team is translating into money left on the table."  via
Still a mystery how many people are unfazed by Biden's visible &amp; growing senility....
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19.  That‚Äôs how many people tuned into Biden‚Äôs virtual townhall.  And the media wants you to believe Trump is losing?üòÇ
Why didn‚Äôt the Dems do anything about it or say anything about it? Everyone could of done something. Nobody knew it came from Europe until later. It‚Äôs easy to Coach a football game after its played! Also, Biden called him xenophobic because of the travel ban.
Look, as much as Berners and sociopaths want me to lose my shit if it‚Äôs not Kamala I won‚Äôt if it‚Äôs another black woman. I find it suuuuucccchhh a stretch that now... in this moment... the Biden campaign isn‚Äôt going to do that. I‚Äôm an adult. I‚Äôll go to bed mad and get up glad.
Biden lucky ..... cuz if it wasn‚Äôt for Trumps extremely sneaky racist ways ... The browns wud give y‚Äôall ass a run for yall money #Biden2020
Exactly! Biden is just a stop gap since Democrats keep putting up the weakest candidates. He needs to just shut up and let us handle the rest...
Ahhh, Biden is not the president!  See how that works!
You said it‚Äôs not under Trump. If this were to happen under Biden, would it be under him? I‚Äôm trying to understand your logic.
#Biden seems to be promising to put things back the way they were, that is, pre-Trump. If he succeeds in this, he will be laying the foundation for another Trump, only worse. I hope to God he knows this, or his presidency will be a 21st Century version of the #WeimarRepublic.
It‚Äôs like they trying to use the Bernie strategy and literally scratched through his name and wrote Joe Biden on top of it. Lol
The meeting shown in the video illustrates the larger role Obama is expected to play for Biden in the months before November.

So true. Yet Tulsi stayed in longer then everyone else except Bernie and Biden and only got 2 delegates. They honestly just embarrass themselves
If Elected, Biden Will Reinstate Obama‚Äôs AFFH Rule Which Trump Just Canceled‚Ä¶It Would Allow Low-Income Housing in¬†Suburbs
Disagree in strategy Tom. If elected,  Biden is a 1 term president. He has 2 jobs: 1) stop the trainwreck 2) pick the next President as his VP.   I don't think Kamala checks off #2.
That blank look on Biden is why they bar him from the car keys
IT'S A JOE BIDEN ECHO CHAMBER!
I loved Reagan also, but this is Biden starting where Reagan also.  He is out of it
Reagan was 77 years, 349 days old when he left office in 1989, the oldest to ever serve.  Joe Biden will be 77 years, 348 days on election day, November 3rd.

Well you are currently doing whatever Putin wants, so I can‚Äôt see that Biden will be a problem.  Probably nobody likes you.  Oh, and you are still a traitor.
Biden on CNN right now sounds clear as a bell. Gtfo.
I hope you‚Äôre voting for VP cause Biden‚Äôs senility will render him useless.
I‚Äôve had so many of them respond back with crazy nonsense.  They really believe that this is Biden‚Äôs fault because trump told them it is!  I can‚Äôt fathom the level of stupidity it would require to believe this clap trap!
Biden Campaign Tells Fox News That He is ‚ÄúNot Available‚Äù to Sit Down With Chris Wallace For An Interview Like Trump¬†Did
But how do we break it, Brit? It even goes largely unreported by Fox who is stuck on 24 hr Covid &amp; Antifa/BLM coverage with a Biden story thrown in briefly between.  Particularly,  has had some great, yet largely ignored pieces.  Get your heads together &amp; get it out.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.

She‚Äôd better be, Biden won‚Äôt.
Joe Biden lol
Great discussion. Will sway. I have voted D my whole life. So far, Biden is WAY too soft on CCP. The Chinese government is an existential threat to US and should be treated as such, IMO.
A vote for Biden is a vote for Putin
The #PelosiVirus is a much bigger threat to the free world. Pelosi, Biden, Sanders, Maxine Waters, Bass, and too many more to name have been on the Russian payrolls and fronts for the Democrat Socialist (Communist) Party for DECADES!  Resign you traitorous battleax!
Biden Calls Trump ‚ÄúRacist‚Äù, Civil Rights Atty Leo Terrell ‚Äì Biden Has Been ‚ÄúInsulting‚Äù to Black Americans, ‚ÄúPeople Decide on the Competency of the Candidate‚ÄùUsing a funeral to campaign.... Sad. Where‚Äôs Biden?
You still believe that Russia story and you call me stupid? That was debunked and the people involved are being investigated... including Biden, Obama and Hillary.
If Joe Biden or any Democrat had been president when caronavirus struck and responded EXACTLY like Donald Trump has done they would be praised to the hilt for saving millions of lives. I know it,  you know it, everyone with a brain knows it.
Trump news: President gets defensive over plummeting polls as Pence, Pelosi, Biden and others pay respects to John Lewis
I agree, biden does need to be put away. But I don't want to know how you know he is a limp dick. Guess y'all have been sniffing on each other.
Everyone is focused on the death toll from covid. Has anyone considered the death toll of an election if biden wins? Just food for thought.
I just watched a 2 term black president tell mourners that John Lewis didn't do enough to secure racial equality (I won't have a straight face for quite awhile - I'll have to stop watching clips of Biden too). üòé
Oh yeah, he‚Äôll get a pardon for the obstruction, never be charged for milking the presidency, and a dozen other federal crimes, but he will be indicted for tax fraud and money laundering. But don‚Äôt sweat it though. He‚Äôll be out and you‚Äôll be focused on destroying Biden by then.
I think there should be a counter/notice for every time Biden answers his remote when his cell phone rings. Come on Twitter, you can figure it out, right?

Joe Biden has entered the chat
You ever hear Biden speak?

William R. Evanina, director of U.S. counterintelligence, warned that¬†China, Iran, and¬†Russia¬†have engaged in active measures to influence political opinion ahead of the November election. Our enemies want Joe Biden to win. I wonder why? ü§î
The Democrat party and the mainstream media have tacitly sanctioned sedition and have betrayed the American people.¬† Consequently, if Biden and the Democrats win in November, they will be incapable of preventing the Marxist ultimatums of the radical left.

Again with the moral ( in your head) high ground. If that‚Äôs true which I‚Äôll take your word... how could you vote for abortion since today‚Äôs Democratic Party... Including Biden... is pro choice? The hatred for trump is more important then the future of this country... Nice.

Biden‚Äôs Foreign Policy

Problem is who‚Äôs leading Biden. I wasn‚Äôt a trump fan either but I am pro life, pro 1st and 2nd amendment. Watching the assault on churches by govenors isn‚Äôt the same country I was born in. Before you say anything about ‚Äústorm troopers‚Äù ( I‚Äôve provided security zones all over...
I served and deployed several different capacities. Oconus and  issue with Biden and the dems they pushed Russia for 3 years knowing it was crap (Steele dossier). Bernie is a proud socialist. What deal did the moderate Biden make to get the nom?
If Biden wins is that cheating?
The Democratic Party has been running a cargo cult for some decades. It is placing a bet that its latest savior figure, Sleepy Joe Biden, albeit an empty senile shell of a cult leader, can do it again and fool the people‚Äîone more time.

Biden needs to take the same cognitive test that Trump takes and have the results made public at one of the debates,although I doubt Biden will even debate the President!
NYT Reporter: Intel Officials Believe Russians Using Hunter Biden Allegations to Distract from Election InterferenceBiden support is soft. If he starts to go under his support will dump him fast
Trump will murder Biden in the debate.
*3 months into presidency* ‚Äúpresident biden has reportedly signed an executive order removing the need for passwords. says that they are too hard to remember and can‚Äôt get into any of his accounts anymore.‚Äù
At this point Biden knows we don‚Äôt have a choice but to vote for him. NO CHOICE. It‚Äôs basically like he‚Äôs running against himself.
Keep in mind, Joe Biden has been running for president since 1987. And still... only 106 references to him as "too ambitious." If I include articles that mention Hillary Clinton, it goes up to 154.  13/
I searched  for "Candidate Name" + "too ambitious." Here are the results:  Al Gore: 18 Joe Biden: 106* John Kerry: 112 G.W. Bush: 150 Mitt Romney: 176 Donald Trump: 380* Barack Obama: 707* Hillary Clinton: 1,166  *Excludes ones that refer to Hillary Clinton
I'm not too concerned about any of this having an effect on Biden's decision. He's been in the game long enough, he knows how it's played.
Kind of like that Politico from the other day where Chris Dodd said she shouldn't be VP because she was mean to Biden at a debate one time.
Important to note that these are literally just Biden donors/allies who are all mad about Harris for Reasons and don't want her to be VP.
Just wondering if they have ever asked the same question of Biden supporters????
I see what you‚Äôre saying. But there is just no way I‚Äôm voting for Biden and whatever corrupt POS gets named his running mateüòÇ Bc we all now that senile son of a bitch won‚Äôt last two weeks
With fewer than 100 days until the presidential election, presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden has announced he will choose his running mate next week.
Trump is the best option. Who wants a pedophile in office? That is what Joe Biden is! Watch any video of him around a woman or child and you can clearly see that. According to the world ya‚Äôll are into that sorta thing though huh?
Former Vice President Biden will bring empathy to the American people, as soon as he is inaugurated on January 20, 2021! Your dad in incapable of empathy! He is a narcissistic psychopath, who only cares about himself!
Did Biden pay them not to host it?
Lol at Chris Dodd saying Biden wants a "loyal no. 2" in regards to Harris. Is this Game of Thrones? Do they think Kamala is going to murder him and take the White House?
I look forward to you joining me in saying Biden was chosen by God to be #46. Unity!
Biden was not my first choice. He wasn‚Äôt my 2nd. But, I will vote for him because I honestly don‚Äôt know if communities I advocate for could survive another 4 years of fascism. I don‚Äôt know if I could.
YOU are the MOST HATED President in American history! I am willing to swim through shark-infester waters on November 3rd to vote FOR Joe Biden for President and AGAINST YOU!
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.

Is that what y‚Äôall have been doing for 4 years in case Biden loses?? You helped bring all the chaos on and we haven‚Äôt forgotten it.
Biden's pitch to the electorate should unironically be "Listen folks, when Barack and I were in the White House we had the cinnamon challenge, the Harlem Shake, and Gangnam style. We're gonna bring that back." He'd win in a 1964-esque landslide.
Someone this sick and demented is likely a very big liberal supporter. Has anyone checked the Biden Rally's for this guy? It would be easy there are only like 8-10 ppl there with 75% of them being Karen's. #maga #kag

Twitter is harming American citizens &amp; it's sad because this drug has saved hundreds of thousands of lives &amp; FDA has Killed hundred of thousands with their greed &amp; Biden don't know where he is, but U will trust him when he says its ok.  Not me! Wake Up people U being denied truth
No it‚Äôs not. My daughter just told us last night there‚Äôs 2 white dems working in the bank she works. I was shocked. I‚Äôve lived in this city since 1990 and I‚Äôve only met 1 other white man that votes dem. And he actually had an Obama Biden sicker on his car. Ppl just assume I‚Äôm rep
There will be no AG Barr arrest on Biden. Democrats are above the law.
Please don‚Äôt write anything in on the ballot. That‚Äôs just a vote for trump. It‚Äôs no different than ticking the box for trump. Just hold your nose and vote for democracy. Joe Biden.
Especially for someone that‚Äôs done so much evil.   The last poll I saw of Ohio, Biden only lead him by 1 point. I‚Äôm gonna go ahead and give trump a win there, figuring in tampering and voter suppression.
I read tweets asking questions like what should Biden do 1st when he‚Äôs elected? They think trump losing is a done deal, just like in 2016. I can just see the depression resister videos already. üò≠üò≠üò≠  I‚Äôm scared guys. Nov. could be a great month or the worse of our century.I have to say, she and Biden seem to have an great chemistry, but to have her as Attorney General would be an excellent move. She knows the law, stands by it and has the lady balls to be great at it.
CNN: Three people charged in Twitter hack that hit Biden and Obama.   via
Is this news? Not even Dem Bulbs want to get dragged down in Biden‚Äôs election. It would hurt their cause.
Obama turned John Lewis eulogy into a political soap box for the Dem bulbs cause. He says two words for Mr Lewis and then proceeded to bash the President and praise Biden. Shame, shame.
üòÇüòÇüòÇ Biden the Marxist.
Thanks again Nancy for stalling, not working with republicans and waiting until the last damn minute to negotiate. You and your pathetic party really care about the American people. I pray Biden loses big to Trump .
You got to remember a lot people on the left were behind Sanders and not Biden. And we all saw what the DNC did. That's why they have Biden instead of Sanders. But deep down i dont think they really do hate America.
In any case, the response to either #Trump or #Biden is identical. #Revolution
God help us if Biden wins. But he's getting so bad, they will probably remove him, and insert who they really want last minute. One who was not voted in.
Lol I‚Äôm going to feel bad for Biden going against Trump when the presidential debate starts.. yet again I‚Äôm not..this guy is going to get destroyed lmao.. Go Trump!!
If #Biden even wins.
Also, credit where credit is due: #AyannaPresley, Warrenite üêç though she was, has also not endorsed #Biden so far. I have not been a fan of Presley, and still am not, but I hope she will follow #RashidaTlaib in explicitly declining to endorse #Biden.
There's actually a lot of truth to this. I read an article about "comfort" and while Sanders may have had a more disruptive message of necessary change, people want "comfort" like Biden, exactly like "elect him and everything will be OK again"
Some Biden allies wage a shadow campaign to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president
what do you think about the theory it's also partially coming from Dr. Biden
should not only refuse to endorse #Biden, she should defect to the #GreenParty.
Biden's notes: ‚ÄòDo not hold grudges‚Äô against Kamala Harris    Can you imagine a president who doesn't hold grudges?  Seems that should be a prerequisite.   what an incredible team for the USA!
The Hunter Biden thing was BS and the American public saw right through it.
Okay and how did the American public react to the Hunter BIden stuff. They rejected it because it was stupid right?
If that‚Äôs true Biden is a coward if he selects anyone else. If he selects someone else and it comes out that IS true, I WILL be refunding my donation.
Please keep up the good work. Watch your back. FBI Wray is not your friend. He's a backstabber. Democrats will take out Biden last minute and insert one who was not elected. Sneaky.
Apparently FOX does too because they just switched to Biden‚Äôs speech
Challenge liberals NOW to make a list of horrible things that are happening under #Trump, that they think won't happen under #Biden. They'll all keep right on happening. #EquallyEvil
Mine too. I had earlier been misinformed to the effect that she HAD endorsed #Biden. Very happy to hear that was not correct. Now if she would only defect to the #GreenParty!
Joe - tell her that being considered a fraction is racist - demand that you be upgraded to a full bowl of $#!+
He attacked members of #khive because they called out Biden and his campaign today and Chris Dodd. But honestly that was just the straw that broke the camel's back in a mountain of straws. Review the account's REPLIES and LIKES to see more.
If Trump wins it will be more difficult for the next Democrat to go on another apology tour. That‚Äôs what Biden really means.
Keep hiding behind your anonymous account with Biden's name and photo. I am don't have anymore time for anonymous trolls like you. Have a nice life bish!
And yet you still responded. You must be a teenager. Probably not even old enough to drink. Go play. Grown folks are talking.
Alright then you can stop talking to me then. And don't think I don't know what you are trying to do with your QTs of my responses. I just don't GAF. You ain't shit.
You think I care about your 10k followers? You want to test how real they are? Keep messing with me and you'll find out.
You can tweet whatever your want but don't act surprised when everyone blocks you.
Delete this tweet. You have always been on thin ice as you frequently tweet borderline problematic shit.
I‚Äôm getting a refund on my Biden donation today.
No we do NOT agree on that! #Biden is NOT a lesser evil. He isn't even a DIFFERENT evil. He is THE SAME EVIL wearing a different mask. Lesser-evilism is a SCAM. It's political three-card monte. #VoteGreen
It could just as easily be #Biden, or whatever secret multiumvirate ends up pulling his marionette strings. The #FascistShift is largely independent of the Presidency.
Umm - senile Joe is afraid to interview and terrified of a debate ...but they're gonna put trump away...hilarious...
Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.  #defunddonaldtrump #voteblue #biden2020
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ I should be the new Marxist poll who in there right mind we‚Äôll I guess there not vote for Biden. Guess the hate so real they will actually vote for Mickey Mouse I guess..sheep
Is that Biden playing soccer or football?
How to tell a Biden voter - they are usually wearing a face covering, not related to Covid, and breaking/smashing/burning/assaulting/killing to show how fired up they are about Senile Joe.
Masks and vaccines won't protect me against #Trump or #Biden. Also, #COVID19 is merely doing what comes naturally. Both #Trump and #Biden actively want me dead.
Biden off more than you can chew
Yeah its been reported that people are just saying "im voting for Biden" due to being scared and all
Hummü§î, would anyone be surprised to see Biden pull Obama (intentional) into ticket as VP? Also, what would u project Biden‚Äôs life to be worth 5 days after inauguration?  Oh yes! My thought processes are OFF after all the Dem crap! Totally unbelievable!
He better! If people vote for Biden they need their head examined!
Biden wasn't my first, second, or third choice but God every time I see this video I could cut diamonds with my dick because I just love the way Bernie just ate a big old dump from Biden's butthole.
That quote tho! How many Biden quotes like that exist referencing Warren? I know that's not the only one for Kamala. There are quotes for days.
He has been on CNN to fuel his propaganda agenda. Really Jimmy get a frickin life. How long has it been since demented Biden was able to make an appearance without a gaffe?
But China owns the DNC. Just watch if Biden gets elected you all will see that.
Good for him, our President. Especially because his recovery record has almost returned to stock markets before this . But mainly it‚Äôs got to be hard to campaign against someone ( former VP Biden) when they ‚ÄúDNC‚Äù knows best strategy is , Keeping him Away from public questioning!
Saw my first Biden flag today
Biden 2020 new slogan plays well on the perception of infirmity and derangement.   #MAGA
I guess when a weak mind comes up with a meme, it has to stick to it to keep from showing how ignorant it is on all other topics - "racist racist racist". Why do actual racists always accuse others of being just like them?
‚ÄúAre you still considering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer as a potential vice presidential candidate?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Biden replied.  I guess his handlers told him that if he didn't understand a question, he was to say, "Yes" and nothing more...when they asked if he understood, he replied, "Yes".
Seriously!  You do realize this TRUMP‚ÄôS America....happening now!  Not in your imagination of Joe Biden‚Äôs America!!  WAKE UP!!!!
