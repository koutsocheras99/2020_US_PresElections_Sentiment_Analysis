How you pro-nounce thay-ut? Typical Trump supporter wondering how to pronounce Federalist.
He needs that trump at a boy and pat on the head and ass
Dermot. Trump won in 2016. He's poised to win again.
Let‚Äôs make sure I understand this: Trump doesn‚Äôt want mail in ballots because he doesn‚Äôt want election results to be delayed? But he also wants to delay the election? üßê
you must READ UP ON THESE LAWS 28 C.F.R. 0.85 TERRORISM  18 U.S. Code¬†¬ß‚ÄØ2331. Section 5 TERRORIST  This is what TRUMP and his ADMINISTRATION is doing in Oregon
Bad on Trump for suggesting a postponed election.   Good on republicans for revolting at the idea.
we must get mr trump et al to dump twitter and fb and migrate to the new competitor...now!
I've got double carpal tunnel surgery being done on my arms, so my voice to text sucks but people need to wake up and understand that Trump knows he is losing and is beginning his effort to undermine democracy. Today is not a press conference it's a declaration of war on America.
Trump is the best thing that‚Äôs happened for the Democratic Party!  Cuts down on making commercials. All you gotta do is let him talk.
Businessman and former presidential candidate Herman Cain has died following a battle with coronavirus. Cain had been hospitalized with COVID-19 for several weeks after attending President Trump's rally in Tusla. He was 74.
Will it be as big a success as  the Taj Mahal? Trump Vodka? Trump University?  Trump steaks? trump marriages?   So much winning.......
You did get it wrong, Trump. You:  - downplayed C19 for weeks  - delayed closing us off from Europe - made states fend for themselves - have no national plan - refused masks until ~140k Americans died  List not exhaustive. You blame everyone but yourself but you own these deaths.
I already fired  years ago. Trump was never a legitimate president of the United States anyway- Hillary Clinton got the popular vote even with Putin interfering AF into our 2016 election. Did I mention that Putin is the Devil and Trump is his "Reek" puppet? üíîüò∑‚úä
Trump will video his own eulogy. According to him no one else could do it better.
President Trump on Thursday morning tweeted the idea of delaying the November election, but that would take an amendment to the Constitution, something Sen. Lisa Murkowski says isn't going to happen.  FULL STORY ‚Ü™Ô∏è
Considering the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù have gotten it wrong on many things (fauchi mask flopping, covid patients to retirement homes...), perhaps the claim that ‚Äúhe isn‚Äôt a doctor‚Äù has less weight today than it used to. Trump making a management decision, influenced by experts is supported
(Narrator:   That's not at all what happened.)  Trump:  Delay Election?    Nope.  POTUS can't, won't happen.  Trump:  Glad to get MSM talking about RISKS of "mail-in".  Left MSM:   corrupt/dictator.  Right MSM:  (please forget what we said previously)
Why does the media continually repeat and repost every distraction Trump creates? They‚Äôre so blind.
......FUCK DONALD TRUMP!!!
This sounds Way too much like Putin's attempt to hold office... We MUST Stop tRUMP. This is NOT Democracy in action.
18 U.S. Code¬†¬ß‚ÄØ2331.  TERRORIST LAW  28 C.F.R. 0.85  TERRORISM LAW  Which TRUMP and his ADMINISTRATION ALONG with BARR and PENCE have been committing
Comments coming out of the gop on this moot topic are their way of indirectly saying they want him out. tRump has no power to delay the election. Everyone but him knows this, because he spilled coke and ketchup all over his copy of the constitution while he was busy tweeting
18 U.S. Code¬†¬ß‚ÄØ2331. Section 5 DOMESTIC TERRORISM  This is what TRUMP is doing now in these MAJOR CITIES; PORTLAND, CHICAGO, DETROIT AND OTHERS,  28. C.F.R. 0.85 of the FEDERAL code on TERRORISM  Both have the death penalty or JAIL and $10,000 fine  or both
I AGREE, Senator. Thank you.  Now, please choose to represent Americans and disavow trump. #AmericaOrTrump
Unfortunately, Trump meets hate with hate.  His speeches &amp; Tweets deride the Dems, and anyone who disagrees with him.  Both Dems &amp; Repubs are at an impasse &amp; not working together.  We need new Leadership, &amp; Trump's tone is NOT unifying.  Why would you vote 4 more years of this?
TRUMP is more than petty he is a FULL BLOWN TERRORIST who does TERRORISM UNDER THE LAW  18 U.S. Code¬†¬ß‚ÄØ2331. Section 5  DOMESTIC TERRORISM
Agree. Thanks for the dialogue.  Do you think Trump's words and Tweets add to racial tension, police brutality, and mis-information regarding COVID?
How come your not dead yet? If Trump is who you say he is shouldn‚Äôt you be wearing goggles and a mask? Why not scuba gear and a plastic bubble. We are onto the scam. Take a hike....
Even if you manage to rig the election in your favor. Keep in mind the Democrats will win the Senate have power over the house and you will be impeached again. The Trump clown show is coming to an end.
Trump is on a path to change Alaska's environment more than any other state. This article focuses on Pebble mine, Ambler Rd and Tongass NF, but the administration also is making significant changes to the NPRA and the Arctic Refuge. #akleg
Even a rat will turn on you when it‚Äôs cornered. These are the words of a desperate scared individual. You know the end is near and you will do everything in your corrupt mind to prevent the end evitable. America is done with you impeach failure liar 45th president Donald J Trump.
Agree.Were you objective w/Obama? I was. Please list Trump accomplishments I see huge racial divide,greatest DROP in GDP (several times over), sky-rocketing Deficit &amp; Unemployment.  And when the tax break trump signed for middle-income Americans expires, our taxes will go Way Up.
Alaska‚Äôs Energy Desk reports that the largest U.S. national forest will probably be impacted by the Trump administration‚Äôs recent revisions to the National Environmental Policy Act.
The limb ALWAYS seems to get lobbed off behind them.  Must be some really good fruit, or they like looking like DOLTS.  (or Trump likes making them look like DOLTS).
I smell a coup . trump will not leave without a fight .
The more  and other media outlets even question something that is laid out plainly in the constitution, the more traction you will give tRump in trying to intervene in americans' right to vote on nov 3rd..stop with these ridiculous polls. Its moot
Just like Obama did. But got blamed for giving trump a bad turn overü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Yes, Trump supporters are absolutely stupid, 100% without question.
Trump floated delaying the November election. Here‚Äôs what Alaska‚Äôs congressional delegation says about that.
All the evidence you need to know about Barr licking trump‚Äôs boots.
Puerto Rico is fucked trump doesn't think they are part of America.  trump is now willing to hurt non racist white people in Portland brown people in Rico are doomed.
Sadly, I don‚Äôt see it happening. I wouldn‚Äôt put it past Biden to forgive Trump all his transgressions ‚Äúin the interest of unity‚Äù ala President Ford and Nixon
Obama out here giving us verbal gymnastics. Some time today trump will stand in front of a mic a say i had a bigg-lee-rrrrr crowd the size no one ever seen before.
It‚Äôs pretty common among tin-pot dictators and fascists. Right down to the use of repetition, changes in tone and pace, and other speech patterns. A lot of what they say is nonsensical.  A Half-Century After Wallace, Trump Echoes the Politics of Division
When Moscow Mitch rejects Trump's nonsense, you know it's some next-level nonsense!
'We will not be leaving' Portland until 'safety' is restored: Trump   18 U.S. Code¬†¬ß‚ÄØ2331 Section 5 Also STATES that this ACT is  DOMESTIC TERRORISM  TRUMP PENCE and the ADMINISTRATION are TERRORIST
Herman Cain just died after catching COVID-19 at a Trump anti-mask rally a couple weeks ago
'We will not be leaving' Portland until 'safety' is restored: Trump   Under 28CFR 0.85 THIS IS THE ACT OF TERRORISM
Man trump has like 250 pounds on Obama.
My statement wasn‚Äôt why you thought Trump was dangerous, that‚Äôs too loaded of a question &amp; not fair to ask, I agree. You said he was the reason or createated (can‚Äôt remember which)Antifa &amp; BLM. I‚Äôm very confused by that since they are both Democratic groups.
The bounds of Trump's narcissism and quest for absolute power are truly frightening. This is the kind of rhetoric one would expect to see in Russia, North Korea, China, etc., but not in the United States of America. Trump is a menace. I'm quite scared.
Trump 2020
How have we sunk so low that trump is president? Watching President Obama giving John Lewis eulogy brings tears to my eyes.

Your support of Trump is why you‚Äôre still at McDonalds! Stupid is... as stupid does!
President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, both promise sweeping progress over the next four years ‚Äî via starkly different paths.
They‚Äôre all afraid of Trump! Stupid asses should have voted him out of office at impeachment! Boom fear gone!!

US, BRAZIL, and INDIA. WE are in the same bracket as those countries in regard to covid infections. Jfc. Never thought we‚Äôd see the US in the same sentence in this type of failure. Ebola would have killed half of us had it hit w Trump running the country. That‚Äôs one thing to

Well, this explains the tweets by Trump on the election delay.  Any distractions, now matter how asinine, still distracts from this bleak news.

Trump is bumping off all members with this virus this is his warfare and you allow this
The dates of presidential elections ‚Äî the Tues. after the first Mon. in Nov. in every 4th  year ‚Äî are enshrined in federal law &amp; would require an act of Congress to change. The Constitution makes no provisions for a delay to the Jan. 20, 2021 inauguration.
You read the Bible? Does the Bible  promote Donald Trump‚Äôs racist views? Does the Bible support your racist tweet?! Are you saying poor people don‚Äôt work?! Ask Christ about poor people! Dumbass! Jesus would agree!
He died from the Trump Tulsa super spreader strain. What does he win Johnny?
So also, can we stop mocking the people who are preparing for the possibility that Trump won't leave office when he loses?
What are you high on? If you‚Äôre such a great President with a silent majority, what are you afraid of?? What‚Äôs fraudulent and inaccurate is this ridiculous lie you‚Äôre telling to steal an election!! The great embarrassment is Donald Trump!!

Hooray for redlining and segregation! Looks like Trump takes after his old man. This is just a personal vendetta from the time he was charged for discriminatory housing practices.
I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be corrected if I am wrong but I believe this is the first time we‚Äôve seen President Trump call for a delay in the upcoming elections. Expect reaction from all sides to follow.

Those deaths are Trump's responsibility. He wants to be the all-powerful, but he doesn't want to take any responsibility. If he had treated this pandemic seriously, he would have marshaled all the great US forces. Instead, he hindered, at every chance.
Hey, where's the Russian bots and Trump supporters?
Fauci is key member of the Deep State plot staging this Plandemic to create a crisis, establish mandatory vaccines, make Big Pharma and Bill Gates even wealthier, assert greater government control, and remove President Trump.
It appears to be the effects of a TIA --transient ischemic attack, or in common parlance, mini stroke.  In Trump's case, some/much of the related pathology has not resolved.
Trump's pulling troops out of Germany is a PAYMENT to Putin. It is a payment for Putin to put EVERYTHING THE RUSSIANS HAVE into subverting the November election.
She said she thought Trump had learned his lesson, and so she didn't vote to remove him. Look where that had gotten us. Either she is an idiot, or she was lying and don't care what befalls this country. Or both. She has to go.
Yes it is RACISM AND IT SHOWS THAT TRUMP IS ALSO A WHITE SUPREMACIST and in my opinion he is also part of the NEO NAZI MOVEMENT,  TRUMP IS A DICTATOR JUST LIKE ADOLF HITLER was during WWII

I have never understood anyone who is faithful to God backing Trump.  He had never seen or held a bible before he campaigned. Well maybe in a hotel room drawer.  Even talking about him makes me want to take a shower.
Without Democrat fraud he may. That‚Äôs why everyone who supports him, regardless of the state they live in needs to go out and vote!  I‚Äôve heard IL and even NY has increasing Trump support. Alaska sure does.
Wow it‚Äôs the week for devils and demons! Trump must be so proud his makeup fell off.
July 19th (which feels like 5 years ago at this point) trump said:  "We're signing a healthcare plan within two weeks, a full and complete healthcare plan,"  That was 10 days ago.   There is no plan. But he‚Äôs glad he says so much stupid shit that no one will even question this.

Proposed effective date for NEPA update is 9/14/20, subject to congressional (and presumably judicial) review. Based on EO 13807. Trump started gloating 3, maybe even 5 years too early.

It's political...the dum-ocratic mayors across the country are all in on it.  They want the cities to be destroyed so they can blame it on Trump and use it against him in the election.

I remember. I didn't agree with this during Bush's or Obama's presidencies. Do you Agree with this policy?  1) What is it about Trump that you like? 2) How do you reconcile that with his hate-filled speech, name calling &amp; acerbic tone? 3) How do we heal a racially divided Nation?
Donald Trump is crooked AF!!

Trump is a symptom of American citizens getting tried of career politicians getting elected on promises and going back on most if not all of them. Trump despite being an idiot is trying to keep his promises. If they did their jobs Hillary would have been elected.
People wonder why America is they way it is. It's not trump its our own dumbass citizens too stupid to use the tools they have to think. Then proceed to vote for people knowing they will lie about most if not all their promises, or sell them out.
Sounds about right!! Whatever crazy shit floats passed Trump ends up in the WhiteHouse. She‚Äôll be the next Physician hired to work in the Trump administration.

the Press and News people had to evolve to wearing armor helmets masks shields if they are sent to regions where the USA Police might appear, as if they were in a war zone, life under the trump regime
I have that same Q sticker on my car! Along with the Punisher Trump sticker!!!! #WWG1WWGA
He is LYING us into misery and disaster. I'm glad I'm old. I won't have to put up with Trump and Barr much longer. BUT that doesn't mean I won't resist.
What someone should do is find out the names of the so called DOCTORS and if they are dr.s check to see who paid them, all pull their MEDICAL License
They refuse to lose-face.  They can't admit they were wrong.  They REFUSE to admit they ARE wrong.  They will go down with tRUMP.
Trump Made Up His Yankees Opening Pitch Invite: Report  via
Obama's released tax returns - as did EVERY OTHER PRESIDENT for the last 30-40(?) years.  Trump REFUSES to release his tax returns, has stolen from his OWN CHARITIES and is making MILLIONS with his private holdings that he refused to release when he became President.
Who's money are you referring? Obama created an Economic BOOM and Trump rides on Obama's coat tails. Trump says (openly-all the time) that he's "making SO MUCH $$. SO MUCH" and he's referring to his own wealth - not the wealth of the United States.
I've seen those news stories. BUT The amount of $$ the Secret Service (i.e. American taxpayers) spend at Trump properties FAR EXCEEDS his so-called donations.  Again, to what Charities is Trump donating?  That was the original rebuttal received- that he donates.
Trump did the meat and potatoes crime; Roger Stone was covering it up
Trump‚Äôs demon sperm doctor thinks the Illuminati are using Harry Potter and ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs So Raven‚Äù to bring down the government. She also thinks the government is run by reptilians. Does that make the Illuminati the good guys?
Wtf  I thought this was already being done for the past 6 months!!!  So you ARE responsible for the upswing in cases!! Just like trump is responsible for the USA upswing!!! ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ Are you done follow trumps lead yet!!!!!!
If what you say is true‚Äîthat Lewis showed no respect to Trump‚Äîthen Trump attending the funeral would make him the better person. But you obviously don‚Äôt understand that philosophy. And neither does he.  #KindnessMatters
Trump's response to why he's not liked &amp; that his approval ratings are lower than Dr. Faucet:  "it must be my personality".  That clown just doesn't get it, does he? üôÑ
Truth is Trump did next to nothing regarding COVID. 150,000 people dead on his watch. First Clorox now the BS of someone who has talked about demon sperm?
Notice how Trump runs out of the room when Reporters ask him questions he can't answer...truthfully.  Shows he can't handle pressure...which we knew that from day one.  #thelastword
It's out of the Florida Texas Covid playbook. Problem is, the play doesn't work. He panders to Trump - a lot. This is his way of skirting the issue so he can crap all over the Mayors when they inevitably have to do it whether it's a shutdown or a mask mandate.
POTUS retweet of a witch doctor has  also talked about demon sperm/babies. Maybe Trump will also try the demon sperm and get back to us on that.
Proving he can drink with one hand. Trump will be jealous
Trump should go to his funeral instead of Lewis '
Trump doesn‚Äôt know what a plan is. #TrumpHasNoPlan
He did indeed. Maybe Trump told him a secret?
Just another Trump ball licker
Donald Trump, presumably?
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è #OChristmasTree "The bill also includes $30 billion for the Pentagon, including hundreds of millions of dollars for projects the Trump administration had canceled to pay for the border wall, and $1.8 billion for a new FBI building."
Comparing Alaska to any other country‚Äôs increase is covid19 cases is ridiculous.  You are following the lead/direction/order of an inept leader, trump.  He doesn‚Äôt give a shit about how many of us die. Full stop!  You are not doing enough to keep the curve flat! Do better!
I stopped watching after his wuhan comment. Folks this is nothing more than the #gop slop trump feeds us. Cases are up significantly and he reopened us un-safely.
So many places in Alaska are currently being threatened, putting birds, salmon, and people at risk. #ProtectBristolBay #ProtectTheTongass #ProtectTheArctic
‚ÄòYou cannot imagine my guilt‚Äô: Trump voter thought COVID-19 was a ‚Äòhoax‚Äô ‚Äî then it swept through his family
The only way to know is when the midnight rioting ends and whether or not the federal agents then leave the city. Truly, the night time attempts to destroy federal property do not necessarily bode well for proving whether or not Trump is attempting to institute a police state.
U-u-u-u-u-u-gh...  Everywhere, a grifter...
Motive has to be determined. If this truly is a testing ground for Trump to establish a militarized police state, we will know soon. However, this is an assumption given the current circumstances.
Trump's authoritarianism is no double extremely disconcerting. I am no advocate of this. However, my issues are with the violence and destruction by protesters with a movement that allegedly is focused on black lives.
How the fuck can anyone blame Trump for Antifa and BLM?
You‚Äôre blaming Antifa and BLM on Trump?  WTF?
deserves combat pay. #Trump
I have never and will never vote for the incompetent authoritarian president that is Trump.  I challenge you on your statement and would like to know how I am ‚Äòaiding and abetting‚Äô as you describe.
"Break" America?  #destroy is a better description of what Trump is doing. #TrumptheTerrorist
Fauci is a cure, trump is a disease.
Not arguing that. He donates his salary to....whom??  Let's see the tax returns. Why the secrecy? What's there to hide?  Like I said, by Trump's own admission, he makes far MORE $$ in his investments than the Presidential salary pays.
The irony is that if Trump had stepped back and said "I'm going to let Dr. Fauci take the lead on this," he could have a similar approval rating, look like a leader, and maybe even have some space to blame Fauci for some stuff.
Anything to support Trump's lies!!!
Why is nothing done when Mark Meadows solicits help from foreign countries to get Trump elected right out in the open in public?  He doesn't have any bogus immunity!
Hahahahaha, he knew Trump would be watching.
Twitter suspends Donald Trump Jr.'s account for spreading misinformation about the Coronavirus.
Is Trump TRYING to loose the election?
Yeah. The difference is before and after lockdown.  Once they saw in California that minimum resolutions weren't effective they changed. Thank you for demonstrating the stubborn ignorance and unwillingness to learn of a Trump supporter.
Unfortunately  won't MANDATE the KEY protection against transmitting this virus in public! üò†  Shame on Dunleavy-Trump-Wanna-Be
Simple solution don't vote for them again and do research before hand. I love that American's before Trump all but accepted the fact most politicians they elect will go back on more than half their election promises. This is not a government problem its an citizen one.
You can buy Trump university credits with those?
im sorry but I even get a whiff of Trump supporting you‚Äôre outta here bud
Got to love that too show a hurt person and pretend they are innocent. Not a single reference to add context to the image just, TRUMP EVIL REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.
Just found tRUMP's Presidential Diary.
#TrumpKillsTexas and all of America. Everything Trump touches dies.
Florida hits new record with 186 coronavirus deaths, pushing the toll past 6,000    And yet there are MANY Florida residents who will STILL vote for Trump. Someone help me understand why.
Herman Cain is still fighting for his life in a hospital after contracting the Coronavirus during a Trump rally on July 2nd.
Unlike u obsessed folks who don't do their jobs but waste time &amp; money attacking Mr Trump as you've done for 4yrs. AG Barr is a very busy man...perhaps we should ask if he reads tweets of real criminals like HRC, Comey, Strozk, Hunter Biden, Pelosi et al grow up
Sorry but the Democratic Party are nothing but hatred and they have made you a hatful people trump has done more for the American citizens the the 79 years of democrats sad for you to hate so much that you would beat you fellow citizens and burn them out and murder them sad
When you are trying to drain a swamp of bad stink it always is a hard road but you have to stick with it and then you win because you have shined on what freedom is in our country and it‚Äôs not the Democratic Party it‚Äôs republican it‚Äôs trump we are our country‚Äôs only hope
I don‚Äôt know who this guy is but he‚Äôs not for getting Trump out of the Whitehouse.
Trump has not done anything to our country except love it .the Democratic Party has destroyed it ,all you people do is hate ‚Äòthe Democratic Party has bestowed upon you nothing but hatred ,you should all be ashamed of yourselves shame shame shame you hatfuls scum
lolololol   and if cows could fly  and Mr Biden could ad lib without help and if the FBI were honest and if the media weren't 92% anti Trump and If Obama were truly black and not clinically defined as a 'mulatto‚Ä¶.dream on broomstick cowboys! BTW where is Joe?  lol
Dirtbag!! Doing Trumps bidding under oath! It‚Äôs a lie to keep people from voting and for Trump to not except the results! He‚Äôs trying to steal the election with Barr‚Äôs help!
The Supreme Court ruled earlier this month that Trump failed to follow appropriate procedure when he tried to end the program, but affirmed his ability to do so.
AH, more dem twisting the truth...AG Barr was asked about reading Mr Trump's TWEETS. Your highlited area NOWHERE says Mr Trump CALLED Stone, etc.  The word 'called' doesn't indicate TWEET or even WROTE...perhaps u need a remedial course in ENGLISH? sigh
Do you really support Trump?
It's unclear whether any agreement can be reached between Congress and President Donald Trump before Friday's deadline for expiring coronavirus aid.
Boy! those protesters look pretty violent to me! Trump and the Republicans are claiming what‚Äôs not true! With fake video‚Äôs. I‚Äôm disgusted to no end! I will not live in Trump‚Äôs America! He needs to go!!!
After FISA gate, the bogus impeachment, and other activities, Demings has the gall to say that Trump has made a mockery of our justice system.  Wow, Pinnochio!
Mueller and the IRS are following the LAW.  You remember Rules and Laws, right? The government cannot release taxpayers' records without CONSENT.  Why won't your leader Consent? What's tRUMP hiding?  Stop Drinking the Orange-Aid and WAKE UP.
That's not racism!  Trump is correct and alluding to the hypocrisy of the situation.
Lying, disgusting people! What has failed this country is the Republican lack of leadership! Someone who claims law &amp; order is the most criminal president in the history of this country!! You should be working on a strategy to keep Trump out of prison!!
Bill Barr and Trump wants Martial Law will the Democrats cave in ??
Criminals in Trump‚Äôs orbit will all walk! Barr lies his ass off as much as Trump does! It makes me pissed off to no end! For Barr to say he never reads Trumps tweets to me was a lie!! Mueller report should be made available to the public ‚Äú unredacted ‚Äú
First mistake! Listening to Trump. Following blindly, not believing science or Doctors! Not wearing masks or social distancing! And a president who doesn‚Äôt give a shit!
I can‚Äôt stand the Jim Jordens! They don‚Äôt care about the American people, just protecting Trump and his crimes. Pardoning of Stone and Flynn coming soon! Is a disgusting disgrace and injustice for the American people!
I fear Trump‚Äôs legacy of corruption won‚Äôt end with his ignominious defeat in November. No doubt his entitled &amp; equally incompetent offspring will feel compelled to carry on as leaders of the GOP. Can‚Äôt we just bribe them to move to Ibiza?
‚ÄúTrump won‚Äôt accept the results of the 2020 election!‚Äù- shout the people who haven‚Äôt accepted the results of the 2016 election
Bill Barr and Donald Trump are Saying if you get sick and die to bad NOPE thats criminal
Props for Trump
Oh I know, I was joking about that part. Since trump said it‚Äôs illegal that he‚Äôs not trending ‚Äòpositively‚Äô. I will never be afraid of speaking up ‚ù§Ô∏è
Lets get this straight... in all the land, the only governing body that can hold the president or his family accountable is.... Twitter terms of service??? Not DOJ or FBI. SEC or Interpol. Fucking twitter.
Ignore Trump &amp; his supporters and look at the data. HQC has been sabotaged at every turn with biased study after biased study (look up the fraudulent Surgisphere report that got swept under the rug). Remdesivir and these other Vaccines have been given every benefit of the doubt.
Typical of Trump‚Äôs administration! Can‚Äôt see past lining their own pockets, and allowing the suffering of the American people!
. . .  Can we talk about impeaching Trump again, please? üôè
They got rid of that garden along time ago! Can you imagine Trump eating vegetables? Only if they look like KFC!
these video props he is using is what the Trump administration did the protestors was peaceful till one of the cronies attacked a protestor
Many people are having mental breakdowns now.   They don't know how to cope with or manage their newfound anxiety, grief and depression.   Some people, like Donald Trump, are pouring salt in their wounds... üíî
She‚Äôs no innocent! She believes everything Trump himself believes! I don‚Äôt feel sorry for her at all! Just a reminder of the jacket she wore to the border!
Facebook, Twitter and YouTube began scrubbing a video Trump retweeted because it includes misleading claims about hydroxychloroquine, and it glosses over the dangers of taking it. One version had more than 17 million views before it was taken down.
Jordan is using digital Props that Barr and trump started this civil war they are the reason why this happened the protestors was used and white supremacist did all the starting of fires  there is videos
Wait until he gets rid of SS and Medicare! Even they need those benefits! Of coarse these are the people that thought Obama was president during 9/11 and that Trump gave Americans $1200. Out of his own bank account!
Republicans once dominated voting by mail in Florida. But that was before President Donald Trump got involved.
Good idea- it would be like gaslighting Trump back; mess with HIS head. I wish I was still in Portland. I want to be there with the protesters. There are too many Trump supporters in Alaska...
The president is again spreading misinformation about how to combat the coronavirus and the credibility of Dr. Anthony Fauci
Drink away I say! If you don‚Äôt care to see the warning label and just believe what Trump is saying...
I don't like "populism" as an ideal, no matter from whom. Populist ideals too often devolve into Communism/Tyranny ala Stalin and Trump. No individual person or figure should be worshipped to the point of fanaticism- that is what cults do. Cults are bad, mmkay? Scientology = cult
The ones that believe in medical based science believe Dr. Fauci not Donald Trump!! Thank you Ted!
Here we go again!! Hard working Americans suffer and Trump along with his GOP only care about themselves!! More for Trump and nothing for the people he swore under oath to protect! Sounds about right to me.
Typical Trump supporter!! Making fun of the disabled and or someone who has worked hard to overcome a speech impediment!! Idiots!!
Don‚Äôt worry I was blocked too. Even though he was the one who SUED Trump for blocking him.
The attorney general will also touch on other controversies that have shadowed his tenure, including his handling of the investigation into Trump campaign ties to Russia.
Biden will never get voted in if you fucks keep this up with natives they will vote trump in
#LyingTrump is the norm, not the exception.  Trump telling the truth would be newsworthy.
'Latinas for Trump' can lick mah unwashed asshole after takin' a shit, mah dirty ass. Sorry you're fuckin' 'El Gonno"
He can weasel-word with the worst of trump‚Äôs buddies.
"The FCC shouldn‚Äôt take this bait," said Jessica Rosenworcel,  "While social media can be frustrating, turning this agency into the President's speech police is not the answer.   If we honor the Constitution, we will reject this petition immediately."
Trump=Hoover #2~~  2nd Great Depression Millions of Unemployed Americans Tens of thousands dead from COVID...America woefully unprepared for pandemic, thanks to Trump's incompetence America in free-fall with COVID  ^^Under Republicans^^^  All Republicans will be voted OUT!
So true. And how is it that these "church" organizations don't get their tax-exempt status revoked when the 'ministers' engage in direct politics such as this? If they are going to be campaigning for Trump &amp; his pals, they need to pay taxes just like everyone else!!
Excellent advice--we WILL 'turn out by the millions to vote'~~and ensure that ever UnAmerican Republican--starting with Trump &amp; including every other Republican on any ballot~~is voted OUT.  Trump hates Americans, lacks basic ethical values &amp; is a moral disgrace.  #JoeBiden2020
I think it is MUCH worse now than the Watergate era....  Why?  During Watergate, there WERE Republican Senators etc.  w/integrity....unlike now, when all the Republicans have a solid, no questions asked brick wall of support for Trump.  I am really scared for our country. üò¢üò¢
Is this because you desperately want it to be true? That Trump commands the police in each city?
Trump can prove his donations to any number of charities, including COVID-19, by simply releasing his TAX RETURNS.  But - he won't.  And, because he's a pathological LIAR, I don't beleive his claims.
Right now we should focus on getting rid of Donald Trump.
I‚Äôm not doing this childish shit with you. Enjoy your night. It‚Äôs exhausting talking to people who really think trump is a good person all.
Trump's America.  November cannot come soon enough.  #JoeBiden2020  #JoeBiden  #Biden2020
All because of an election? No. Def not his actions, his words, his associations with terrible things? Not his terrible reaction to covid? None of that? Just the electron? No. Dude is a terrible person.Obama DID not do worse. Trump deserves no respect. NONE.
Trump complained on Twitter today that he wasn‚Äôt trending for good reasons on twitter and that it was illegal
Part of the Trump hack job on America
Right. As reported, Trump just MADE UP the date and event of doing this completely unbeknownst to the Yankees AND the White House. So, DUH it would be cancelled. He just MAKES SHIT UP all the time off the top of his heads. #Dementia
Or ever. Racists don‚Äôt recognize Lewis, and Trump‚Äôs a BIG one (haven‚Äôt you seen his tiny little hands?)
President Donald Trump‚Äôs lawyers filed fresh arguments to try to block a criminal subpoena for his tax records, saying it was issued in bad faith, might have been politically motivated and calling it a harassment of the president.
Big ooooof.
Seems like Dana has what it takes to be POTUS. Same personality as Trump.
If she doesn't want to go with him...that's okay..she can go somewhere else!  Just as long as she puts on that "I Don't Care" jacket and moves her hips out of that "House"
Why?  She won't be residing at that "House" too much longer.  I hope she understands that when we send Trump packing and out the door, she must pack to go with him.
Links Barr's statement with Bolton's statement that Trump's interference with policy is always corrupt.  Worth looking at this thread.
seems to be a bit of a sore loser. Apparently he was so bad, Trump couldn‚Äôt even use him to clean toilets.
Dr. Al Gross is up for #Alaska U.S. Senate &amp; I'm voting for him. I especially like 3 of his priorities: (1) Woman's right to choose; (2) climate change initiatives; (3) End Citizens United.  just kisses Trump's ass. #bottomline
Riggghhhht... and trump is brilliant, honest and physically fit.
Haven‚Äôt seen anyone saying this but is it possible that Trump/Barr sent the so called rioters to cause the very trouble they are sending the storm troopers to stop?
It's just downright disgusting that the  that includes #Alaska's GOP...have stood by and let Trump treat this country like its his own personal hole to shit on.  Shame on you
supporting trump is micropenis energy btw
Opinion | Trump wanted his Roy Cohn. In William Barr, he found his John Mitchell instead.
trump out here really calling freedom of speech illegal
Not as invested in this as you are.  I respond between customers. Right now getting another beer watching "Mob City". Excellant TV series.  You want this orange man bogeyman to be real.  Those GS1811 series dudes in the pics, were on the job before Trump, and will be there after.
Trump trying some bullshit by asking the FCC  to control our content well the users support the FCC by paying to use the internet will they want us to stop   ???
What are YOU doing about reports of bounties being paid for MURDERS of Americans in Afghanistan? Are you still COVERING for Trump? Your DELIBERATE DISREGARD of this VERY SERIOUS MATTER is INEXCUSABLE and is VIOLATION OF OATH OF OFFICE!
True. And he SHOULD donate his salary, because it covers a Fraction of Secret Service expenses - charged to the taxpayers.  He's making a Ton of $$ elsewhere, by his own admission.  The only way to KNOW if tRUMP makes charitable donations, is for him to release his Tax Returns.
This is beyond evil and insane. Trump is out of control and it will just get worse as he realizes how badly he‚Äôs losing.
I just hope we can all look at the biggest issue right now - getting rid of Trump. I liked Buttigieg and Warren a lot but even during the Primary I wasn‚Äôt going all in for anyone emotionally because I wanted to support whoever won. Biden isn‚Äôt perfect. But he can dump Trump.
Jealous if Fauci, Trump pretends to have a first pitch event planned and then backs out of it
Amen. You couldn‚Äôt keep me from the polls. I want to be a nail in Trump‚Äôs coffin.
neither here nor there but I don't think there's even a political left right now. Biden isn't some unreasonable communist that's pushing people toward trump, Biden is the middle.
So another stimulus huh, maybe Trump‚Äôs America isn‚Äôt that ba.... jk jk fuck that guy run me my money thanks
So you don't know anything about the drug except that trump endorses it.

God bless you President Trump!
This is NOT The America We're Looking For
I think, just as unthinkable as the Trump world would have been six years ago, it's hard to say what the world looks like if he loses by, say, 10% this fall.
Trump keeps repeating ‚Äúmake America great again‚Äù like girl are you tryna use the 33 or whatever method for manifesting? ü•¥
Y‚Äôall do stupid things to back up these evil people especially like Obama, trump and co ü§£ü§£!! Y‚Äôall supporting them will see the light soon just wait

add Alaska to this list! Dan Sullivan‚Äôs seat (votes w Trump 97% of the time) is winnable by Dr Al Gross, a doctor &amp; Independent who would caucus w Dems. every seat counts. this race is actually getting close. #VoteLikeYourLifeDependsOnIt #VoteForOurLives
I agree! However we all know no matter how he loses, trump will piss and moan about the results, get his crazy base to act on his behalf. Look how he lied about the turn out and how we say he got the Popular vote.  TYT #TooStrong
Fake made up shit is Trump‚Äôs entire Presidency! Why do you support this person? What has he done for you?? How much do you believe all of the lies he‚Äôs told? Do you care about this country falling into a dictatorship?? It‚Äôs unbelievable!! Open your eyes!!!
You still don't understand Testing, do you?  55 Million Tests are no good if the results are not back for over a week ... you need to know where the virus is within 48 hours to do tracing - which lets you isolate those infected.  Trump - take a Science Class, will you please!?!
Good Job - Elon!  Its too bad your labor force in Texas is dieing at historic rates from the Trump Virus - which is hitting Texas especially hard as there is no requirement to wear masks or social distance.  But I'm sure by the time the plant is built, you can hire what's left ..
I‚Äôm blue in a red state!! No matter how we vote, they‚Äôll do what they want! We have a Democratic mayor who has busted his butt to house the homeless and make sure people are safe!! Then Trump wanted everything opened and now the virus is out of control.
They are ready for war!! They‚Äôre calling for civil war if Trump loses! Why? I just don‚Äôt get it! What do they see in this dumbass?!
Biden supporters are the Trump supporters of the left. Where are the moderates?
But those people in the Bible Belt will still vote for Trump!! No matter what he does... they don‚Äôt care!

Trump - you are one to call the kettle Black ... you have disregarded so many laws, customs and procedures during your 4 years in office no one can even keep count.  Do us all a favor - catch the Virus &amp; end up in an ICU, so someone can decide whether you are worth Life Support.
You idiot - by the time you "Banned" folks from China - the virus was in Europe &amp; you let them in ... That's where 150,000 US Deaths started - I even tried to warn you with a Tweet &amp; Photo on April 15th - but you don't read replies, do you?  Folks - Trump is worthless ...
Folks - Trump is getting desperate ... DESPERATE ... he is using Federal Officers to incite violence in otherwise peaceful protests ... the word is he doesn't plan to leave office when he loses the Election ... watch out for him using his "FEMA Card" when he loses the election ..

To be fair, we're in a fucking weird situation. Making the country worse = better for Trump is like the election version of a Giffen good.
I‚Äôll see you around 5:00. Oops, the fucking Trump virus travel restrictions won‚Äôt let me cross the border. Oh well, maybe post pandemic.
We‚Äôre witnessing Trump and Barr‚Äôs criminality on the streets of America. Everyone of these men who are participating in this are criminals.
The Trump administration seeks to greenlight controversial Alaska mine.  A final decision on Pebble Mine could come within a month
Someone is. I think there‚Äôs a handler close to Trump. I think Eric Prince has to be involved in this too.
It‚Äôs plain evil and hurts that people are saying that a child‚Äôs social life is more important than someone‚Äôs actual life. COVID-19 does not discriminate. Trump wants schools open for his benefit not yours and mine.
We have a moral obligation to vote and to correct the injustice that the Trump criminal clown show has betrayed for the last 3 1/2 years. #VoteHimOut!
Gee, you think.
Not only can‚Äôt he fix it, he can‚Äôt even hide it.
He envies their status and power. Inside, he is an insecure little boy.
Im shure Trump would be fine just repaying all 35$ of those sales. Man you guys are desperate . I Can‚Äôt wait for Nov 3rd
That has got to be the stupidest response yet . Are you kidding me . Trump‚Äôs gift shops are just raking it in ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇüòÇ ok
You can‚Äôt make it up. And oodles of public money transferred to Trump‚Äôs business partners.
There‚Äôs a lot going on right now.  We can‚Äôt lose sight of our impact globally. The Indigenous people in Brazil are facing genocide at the hands of Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúgreat friend‚Äù that he thinks is ‚Äúdoing really well in Brazil. We‚Äôre very proud of him‚Äù #voteblue
Trump's America.  Putin told him to do this -- to "dominate"
They claimed Trump wouldn't accept defeat in 2016 then he won. Now they claim Trump wont accept the election numbers which means they will cheat to win. What the Dems do is point the finger every time when in fact it is them that will not accept Trump will win the 2020 election.
Every single Trump supporter go and vote on Election Day, no matter the State. The larger the turnout for President Trump, the stronger he is for us his second term.
He is the man who is saving this country. He has God's hand on his shoulder guiding him. Best POTUS EVER! I thank God he sent Trump to lead us.
Nah, Ivanka only sounds reasonable now because she's spent time in the White House. Most people would see Trump as a clown, and she'd be about 3X less prominent than she is today, and hurt by her last name.
Where she scrapes by, Trump, who spent the pandemic criticizing her for not closing the borders of the country in January. Where she trounces him, Rubio, whose reasonable stance on immigration seems prescient.
In your hypothetical, did she just scrape by in the swing states and still win by about 2% of the vote, or did she crush Trump by 10%?
#90dayfiance FOR REAL!! It‚Äôs because of all these decades of calling us the leaders of the free world, leaders of everything! We‚Äôre number one! Then we land ourselves Trump! üôÑüôÑüôÑ
Doesn‚Äôt matter who Fred Ryan is. Trump putting Reagan‚Äôs likeliness on the schlock he sells to his followers is something anyone in their right mind would object to.

just wait until you see the relatable jim halpert memes about donald trump, much like Deadpool I'm really not afraid to "go there"
He is a dangerous nutcase. And if Trump gets a second term, he will wield vast power -- even more power than he has now. I predict that Trump will make a point to bring him into his regime.
Yes .. dealing with Trump‚Äôs idiocy and not losing his cool... I  think Fauci rocks and I pray we all listen to his words.

The funny thing is that I challenged you as to why you believe I am a racist. Instead of having an intelligent discussion on this topic, the only tool In your aresenal is to berate me.   You have much more in common with a Trump supporter than you realize.

Now you see what a cornered scared little man will do. Even a rat will turn on you when he‚Äôs cornered. Right now impeached failure as a president Donald J Trump is cornered and turning on the American people.
You are perhaps expecting a joint Putin/trump announcement of guilt. Don‚Äôt hold your breath. While we are talking proof, where are the verifiable denials of this conduct.
Trump has a vested interest in breaking the country so he can rerun his 2016 campaign that HE is the only one who can fix it.  We need to be smarter than the traitorous snakeoil salesman and hold him (and the gop) accountable for the damages. Make them pay for it.
Wonder if Trump has a sending in white supremacists?  Makes sense to me. He honestly believes the means justifies the end.
If trump is breathing, he is lying.
The example trump sets is worse than disgusting. The fact that it is cynically aimed at ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù voters is even more horrible.
Time has no meaning anymore. Has it been two weeks since trump said he would release some magical fairy tale land version of health care yet?
Lady was tryna say that's what's gonna happen if Biden is elected as if neo-nazis don't support Trump lol

Thanks, I‚Äôm honored. Lacking first hand knowledge, I have read reports addressing this particular point in detail. Trump and his crew are making many outlandish accusations about Biden somehow destroying the country without anything but their opinion to back it up.
Empathy or not, vote them out for refusing to rein in trump.
Paul Krugman: What you don't know can't hurt Trump
So Trump admits he doesn't mind Russia, or anyone, influencing our presidential election? It's no longer interference it's influence. Trump really believes words make the entire difference.
Biden doesn‚Äôt support defunding the police, he supports improving them. If you are going to attack, don‚Äôt take trump‚Äôs word on anything.
Voting won't work because Donald Trump is already suppressing the vote, has shown he will incite civil war before leaving office, and no one in Congress will hold him accountable-  But sure, whatever- keep giving people false hope about how voting in November will fix everything.

Trump and the gop have corrupted the country, not just the government. It has become a non-shooting civil war. American against American, family member against family member. That‚Äôs what you get by electing someone who describes innocent people as criminals, for votes.
It‚Äôs easy to spend someone else‚Äôs money for them. It‚Äôs even easier to criticize when you don‚Äôt have all the facts. Remember, trump is the enemy.
The last thing we need is Dem. infighting before the election. Nothing would make trump happier.
Trump keeps lying and scapegoating everyone in sight. It‚Äôs like a whiteout in a blizzard of bs so no one can distinguish right from wrong, truth from fiction. Expect him to create crisis after crisis until the election, which he may well try to subvert.

But trump stands for the common man, so he must be pushing for extended benefits, right.
It‚Äôs likely trump and Pompeo are deliberately picking a fight for distraction from Covid-19.
Lol why the hate man? So what if they support Trump, or sympathize with him. That doesn‚Äôt make them bad people. A little more embrace from both sides would be nice.
Rest your mind God is in control here with his helpers those patriots. Trump wins no matter what these evil beings plan.
He actually provided signs for trump and BLM.
Trump requires an enemy to rage against. His supporters imitate him.

And I heard they dragged out their answers so there wasn‚Äôt time to answer many questions. And none that mattered, like why didn‚Äôt they call out Trump for ignoring the bounty on the heads of American troops.
DHS was created to circumvent posse comitatus. Trump probably told her they were coming either way. She felt if she played ‚Äúnice‚Äù she could bargain and reel them in. Bad move. She just made herself a pawn by accepting their ‚Äúhelp. She can‚Äôt control armed fascists.

Allies and our fellow Americans. They say Trump fights for them. They say he tells it like it is. They say he is like the evil kings in the OT that God used to do His will.  They WANT a bully to kick ass on their behalf. That‚Äôs what makes me so sad, to see what
What I have observed in my own family is akin to all the little kids who follow the bully around the school yard and cheer him on when he picks on the nerd. My family is delighted when Trump slams people verbally. They love the nastiness of his treatment of our

Yup, the Murdochs donate heavily to Biden.  The establishment needs to be broken and Trump is well on his way. We live in an amazing time really, politically/scientifically/technologically. I personally think this election will have fundamental ramifications for years to come.
That's a drop in the bucket considering the amount of damage the Murdoch family has done over the years. But at least it's something. I wish someone would do a Mary Trump style expose on the inner workings of THAT family.
Ammon Bundt.  Have you been living in a hole?
Blame it all on Trump.  He‚Äôs the reason. Period, end of story, the end.
This for example. Trump has complained about China shittyness for years. Maybe he knew we would decouple so he set up India to help fill the role. He‚Äôs done some seriously impressive things my friend.
I would also argue that Trump isn‚Äôt really all that conservative. Your assessment may be correct that conventional conservatives may see no need for change, but it would be extremely difficult to argue that Trump hasn‚Äôt made some seriously big moves both domestic and abroad.

Although there were things that I didn‚Äôt agree w that his admin did, he was a good president and def worked hard. Harder than trump that‚Äôs for sure!
I'm saddened by what tRUMP has done to your relationships.  No President in recent history has been more divisive.  You've earned a new Follower.

SHAME ON YOU &amp; your GOP colleagues for SHIRKING your legislative duties &amp; FAILING to work on COVID relief bill. All claims by BOTH OF YOU that you‚Äôre working to benefit Alaskans are thus exposed as LIES! You WORK for US, NOT for McConnell OR Trump!
You do realize that Melania Trump enjoys the same privileged lifestyle, has never worked a day in her life (modeling doesn't count) AND that Trump doesn't donate to ANY Charities - not even his OWN.
&amp;  How DARE you call GOP handling of COVID relief bill RESPONSIBLE &amp; CARING! 1000s of YOUR CONSTITUENTS &amp; OUR neighbors are in dire straits because of Trump‚Äôs inept handling of pandemic &amp; GOP weak response to its impacts on Americans. DO YOUR JOBS!
Let‚Äôs hope so! Missing from your list is Trump sycophant
Yet sycophants like Howard Levell say we should be ‚Äúhappy‚Äù about Trump‚Äôs handling of COVID pandemic! #TrumpVirus #TrumpResignNow
Who wants to tell Trump this isn‚Äôt working out?
Levell is spouting utter BS about Trump‚Äôs handling of #TrumpVirus pandemic. 146K deaths is NOT ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù or ‚Äúcompetent‚Äù handling! NOR is failure to develop effective testing program!
Nope.  I am neither confused nor a MF‚Äôer.  I am an American who is disgusted by the people who support trump and what horrors they have allowed him to do.  They betray the spirit of America and embody the dark, hateful  goo that we have been trying to root out.  Shame on them.
Current polls show 35-40% of voters in PA, MI, &amp; OH support Trump. What is wrong with those people? Are they ALL deranged?

I would stand out in 20 below blizzard conditions with a bull moose  staking me on one side and a bear on the other .. Screw Trump .. big tsunami headed his way
please bring up this execution in your next presser. Media is now acknowledging the hate and violence against Trump supporters. This man was executed for his support of POTUS. This is horrific.
This has to come from the mouth of trump! ü§¨
...but yet Trump wants to force the rest of America's kids back in school.   üôÑ
It gets easier with time. After enough time, the good memories come back with equal force to combat the hurt. Hang in there, man.  Also, with the right love at the right time, Trump wouldn't be  Trump.  "Hate can't drive out hate, only love can do that." -MLK
Trump cast his directives as far-reaching, but they mostly update earlier administration ideas that have not yet gone into effect.
The only people glossing over this are the people she‚Äôs making watch it who keep downplaying the violence so they can blame trump for acting like a fascist.

Today, the Trump administration released the final environmental impact statement on the proposed #PebbleMine. It ignores entirely the facts, science, and voices of thousands of Alaskans.
Defense policy bills approved by both the House and Senate would change the names of 10 Army posts that honor Confederate leaders. The two versions must be reconciled, but both bills were approved by veto-proof margins this week.
Those deaths are on China, and he's been stronger on them than his predecessor.  The economy was wrecked by the virus, so that's also on China. It was good under Trump before, it will be good under him again.
It normally takes 10-15 years to get drugs &amp; vaccines on the market. The world doesn‚Äôt have that long to wait. The Trump regime isn‚Äôt developing the vaccines. It may come from a university, another country, a multinational drug corporation, there may be multiple vaccines.
‚ÄúDarker Americans‚Äù as you say have done better with Trump than the last 5 Presidents, particularly in economic power. Trump is about equal opportunity and safety and security for the average American. The racist and anti-Semitic Democrat party will cry otherwise to distract.

They‚Äôre running the same old losing candidate again. That‚Äôs what I fear. He‚Äôs ran and lost many times for President. Cross our fingers and keep the outreach at least we won‚Äôt have trump. Biden is better than trump that‚Äôs for sure.
I almost worry that they purposely do this so we don‚Äôt continue our outreach. Hilary left out the most important places bcuz she underestimated trump. I hope Biden understands this. I‚Äôll vote for biden but ugh. I fear this won‚Äôt end well.

Great and tremendous points!!  Truth backed up by facts!!  President Trump - Law and order, America first; Biden - Lawlessness and globalism (America last)!
THIS IS real journalism. If only we had more press willing to counter #Trump BS as directly and factually as Barbara was.
Trump is using Portland Moms to distract from all the other heinous shit he's done.
It's obvious trump hired you, stop drinking the koolaid!

Trump undermines new virus strategy by hiding experts and facts.

President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he will send federal agents to Chicago and Albuquerque, New Mexico, to help combat rising crime.

Americans are done with the ConMan grifter impeached 45th posing president Donald J Trump. #TrumpVirus #TrumpClownShow #TrumpIncompetentDelusionDistraction.
145,000 Americans actually.  How many 9/11s is that? How many Titanics  That is more Americans killed by the trump virus than ALL OF THE US SOLDIERS KILLED IN AFGHANISTAN.
Trump is not to blame for this.
Big papa Joe Biden 46th President of the United States. Successor to impeached failed 45th president Donald J Trump Trump was defeated in a landslide victory.

Because they‚Äôre all compromised. Why only impeach on Ukraine and not the corruption? They‚Äôre all complicit in this. They make money and gain seats and keep their jobs while we live the HELL OF TRUMP!
Because they‚Äôre ALL COMPROMISED!!! Why didn‚Äôt they impeach on all the shit trump has done and only the Ukraine bullshit?! Because they‚Äôre all making money and winning seats off this shit show!! We are living the HELL OF IT! BABIES ARE LIVING THE HELL IN CAGES!! That‚Äôs why JOE
Actually....you are showing a video of Donald Trump's America.  Trump's America IS a very scary place--unidentified men with weapons are rounding up peaceful Americans exercising their 1st Amendment Right to assemble.  Thankfully, all Republicans will be voted OUT.
We should go to Republican held cities.... see what happens there.  tRump won't do shit.
How ironic that ad men for the Republican potus uses images from the actual tenure of Trump's presidency to disparage a compassionate, ethical &amp; patriotic American.   Nice try, but America is finally woke.  Republicans, thankfully, will all be voted OUT.
Trump Modi visit was an excellent bit of PR for India. Then the Adam Townsend post explaining the reset of the relationship. Think it‚Äôs virtually a guarantee
The Trump administration will pay Pfizer nearly $2 billion for a December delivery of 100 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, health officials announced Wednesday.
I once had a MAGA tell me that people are doing to Trump "just what they did to Kennedy for being catholic."  People don't blacklist you because of who you support, unless who you support is a lying misogynistic, psychopathic, genocidal murderer.
Trending is Trump‚Äôs America, but all the comments are pointing out it‚Äôs Dem cities haha
Too bad one of those things isn't muzzling Trump.
Obviously fake. Trump's hands are big in this photo.
Sure because Trump caused the Coronavirus and the economy won't go bankrupt with Biden as President.

Oh. The privileged white woman is back with more racism. Fuhrer Trump will be pleased.
This is why we ultimately distrust the Cotton-Sullivan wing of the Senate. At day's end, they are just as willing to spend away. ‚ÄúMeanwhile, Sen. Tom Cotton suggested at the lunch that the GOP needs to be willing to keep racking up debt to maintain power.‚Äù
Never. Ever. If Trump is vastly superior , it‚Äôs only in lies.

They refuse to listen or heed anything negative about their leader? Any news or reports that expose trumps failures are associated with Dems, liberals, or blue and is out right rejected. Ask the trump media machine to explain it.
Umm, this IS Donald Trump's America. As in right now, today, in the present. Talk about self-own.
So here's Trump telling everyone he liked the choice made to use Doral but has no input for that choice AND Then....says "Don't do it" ( sadly) and look at how that story was reported.  Not a Good thing to happen, I reckon.   Subtle, I a!so will reckon :)
Oh, please! Why have Republicans like you spent 6 months pointing fingers and denying responsibility? How many lives would‚Äôve been saved if you‚Äôd buckled done and DONE SOMETHING? This whole episode will go down in history as a giant FAIL on the part of Trump and his collaborators

This is Donald Trump's America.
New York, once by far the leader in infections, has now been surpassed the country‚Äôs largest state, California, for the number of cases, although that is partly because of robust testing in the state.
Ally he general can stick it where the sun don‚Äôt shine! Trump runs this country!
Also blaming it all on Trump guarantees there is no way this doesn‚Äôt end with the destruction of America. Where no one wins and we all suffer as we‚Äôre reduced to a third world country. That will be on people like you.
Big, big difference between giving clemency to thousands of low level drug offenders and Trump circumventing the process and pardoning white-collar crimes that he‚Äôs implicated in.

Maybe you should have never voted for trump so we wouldn‚Äôt be in this mess.
Q: GOP controlled Senate has failed to keep the president accountable for failed COVID plan &amp; all else.  How do each of you live with your own complicity in the Trump admin actions?  Can you at least vote NO on all appointments now til Trump gives taxes to the House?
People need to stop mocking this possibility. Like, what evidence have you seen that Trump would say "oh no, that's too far," or that the GOP Senate would insist on stopping him?
Gestapo trump
Huh, well that's not a good look for Trump if true. That means that if we had stayed locked down and just worn masks, we could have saved 140,000 and counting lives.
Donald Trump cares about Donald Trump.
Trump Campaign uses 2014 picture of Ukrainian protests in order to push meme that American protesters are attacking the police.
Michael Cohen claims upcoming book will reveal Donald Trump's racism and antisemitism.
Please do a similarities video of Trump and Donald Southerland‚Äôs President Snow from the Hunger Games. I think you will find it makes an excellent and devastatingly accurate ad about this unconstitutional authoritarian use of force.
I think the issue is that we're not adjusting for era. Racism Over Replacement President (RORP) is definitely an all-time high with Trump. He's the Pedro Martinez 1999 season of racist Presidents.
Trump has specifically said that he's sending troops there because 'liberal Democrats' are they mayors and they're 'letting things get out of hand.'
Edsall is right on target.  It's not liberal vs. conservative.  It's authoritarian vs. democracy.
Principled? Before Trump came along the Republican Party was obsolete because they compromised on everything.
Congress definitely needs to close all these loopholes that trump has been using to pervert governing.

I never heard Donald Trump utter the word "vulnerable" Nice try.
I stopped reading at   "House Democrats call for resignation of Trump".
And I want some Alaskan senators who aren‚Äôt Trump sycophants... I‚Äôm still waiting
Since you know nothing about me, it sounds like you are adopting the trump strategy of projecting your characteristics onto your opponents. The large majority of protesters are peaceful. There is some concern that the problems are instigated by outsiders.
President Donald Trump and Attorney General William Barr are expected to announce Wednesday that federal agents will surge into several American cities including Chicago to help combat rising crime.
He wouldn‚Äôt want to sway the jury like when Nixon commented on the Charles Manson case, it almost led to a mistrial. So think about it and remember Trump had a huge part in putting Epstein behind bars. The man is damned if he does and damned if he doesn‚Äôt.
To me this makes the Biden +1 more believable. Texas is still red, Trump is just toxic.
Anti-trumpers in Congress from 2016-2018? I recall Trump got blocked by his own party on several things early. And Republicans allowed Russiagate seed to be planted. Handicapping 2018-20 for trump (dems hold house, russiagate blooms)
Perhaps she can explain why Trump can play dictator   against peaceful protesters, but can't order the Defense   Act to manufacture PPE? After all,    just said yesterday:   "(covid19) will get worse before it gets better".  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Not quite.  He only recently started advocating for face coverings. Now Trump is calling it ‚Äúpartiotic‚Äù?  We‚Äôre not playing this game.  Roll the tapes.
I'm indifferent, he's done a decent job in some areas, in some he could've done a lot more.  What's the correlation between a Trump supporter and a pedophile? You need to elaborate on your claim.
It‚Äôs painfully obvious that Trump‚Äôs donor turned Postmaster General has been given one directive: destroy the public postal service. We can‚Äôt let this happen. #SaveThePostalService

Yet, there are governors and trump who are trying to manipulate and hide data from the American people.  You don't seem to be criticizing them.  It almost like you are politicizing the virus.

Trump‚Äôs personality disorders pretty much eliminate introspection. The closest he ever gets is looking in the mirror and telling himself how wonderful he is.
Trump has the street cunning to prey on people‚Äôs fears, insecurities and prejudices. Despots are good at that. Hitler was the classic example.
Trump has a long history of creating crises and chaos as a way to divert attention from whatever misbehavior is currently in the spotlight. He also throws people and organizations under the bus as well as setting them up. Note Covid testing and local protests.

I've been saying it. Ever since Trump applauded the protests in Michigan.  Keep in mind: some people never went into lockdown, some people enjoyed their Spring break, so it isn't all on Trump.  But man, he hasn't helped with the stupid, ignorant things he has said.
