What was this leading light doing when he wrote this?
No one should be under any illusions. The Federalist Society will abandon Trump only because his nascent fascism is public and clumsy.

Trump has done immeasurable damage to the GOP for years to come, with the aid of the GOP to boot.
And Calabresi didn‚Äôt, for example, say that if Trump‚Äôs attacks on the election continue or worsen, his fellow travelers should consider voting for Biden. It is cheap, empty talk.
DEFENDER OF AMERICA!! God raised up Trump to save America from the leftists Marxist Communists trying to overthrow our nation.
You don't have to worry about Trump.
Obama followed a clemency policy aimed at relatively low-level offenders &amp; relied on Justice Department recommendations.  Trump has largely acted outside the normal review process, most recently giving clemency to high-profile white-collar criminals.
You have always been anti Trump...a hater!!!

Although it is customary for the sitting president to give a eulogy at a former president's funeral, Bush said a "lucky circumstance" kept Trump from speaking.  "He had a lucky circumstance there because 43 (George W. Bush)¬†was his son, so he did the eulogy,"
Whenever Trump reads something that he DIDN‚ÄôT write, his face looks as if he‚Äôs holding back the biggest belly laugh.
Please see specifically the method of counting, not validation.  Trump's dream is to suppress.  He has zero other recourse.  The media is trapping people.
Did anyone think Trump could delay the election? You know Trump was only thinking of himself.
Biden didnt do shit in those years of experience except pass &amp; defend racist ass laws. Trump has buisness experience which helps out alot but anyways. I dont think you need political experience to be a decent candidate
And he sacrificed his life for Donald Trump's ego and vanity project. He attended Trump's Tulsa rally, didn't wear a mask or social distance and 9 days later he was in the hospital with COVID.

Hey guys, the economy contracted by 33% in the 2nd quarter. An unheard of number even in the worst economies in history. Trump's depends on the myth of "his good economy" holding up. So he flashes the shiniest object imaginable and the press and social media run with it all day.
And after all that Donald Trump was still able to kill him

Trump still has Barr to help throw out mail in ballots delayed on purpose by his USPS Cronie. Barr has already implied that. What are democrats in congress doing to avert that.
Without an election, trump will still be without a job on 1/20/21.  Pelosi would then take the reigns.
Or just calculation and cynicism. The Federalist Society is proto-fascist. If Trump was popular, Calabresi wouldn‚Äôt care.
I almost forgot about those liability waivers Trump had people sign for his COVID rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
I figured that, once the judicial vacancies were filled, the conservative legal movement would start distancing itself from Trump.

Anyone who isn't a Sheep,  LOVES TRUMP!
So when Biden says something idiotic, it's a joke or a misquote, according to the left, &amp; evidence of mental or physical illness to the right. And when Trump does the same it is a stroke to his foes &amp; 4 dimensional chess to his sycophants. I just think they're both dumb.
trump is incapable of normality...he must be removed...he's lazy and dangerous...yes...he's an animal surviving...yes...exactly...this guy is a genius....we think alike! trump is a predator just trying to stay alive...he must be removed.

Yeah I love dunking on Trump and have no problem with people highlighting the rally. But someone that was as proudly anti-mask as Cain seemed to be was likely going out and doing other unsafe stuff. So I just wouldn't state it as fact that he got it at the rally.
Of course, the Criminal In Chief. Gave all the desperately need funds. To contributors, to Trump Campaign. Now, the states are fending for themselves. Hospital's, have no PPE's, or ventilators. Test sites, are far &amp; in between. Results take two weeks. Business is non existent.
Wouldn't it be fitting for Trump to be charged with Herman Cain's murder? Authorities told him his fascist rally wasn't safe. But that evil freak only cares about himself. Yes, Cain was a schmuck, but he is symbolic of the thousands Trump has MURDERED. #TrumpKillsUS #LockHimUp
Glad to see Trump didn't attend that over hyped talent show for Lewis today.  If you don't like someone when they are alive... don't be a douche bag and pretend you like them when they are dead. #JohnLewisMemorial

They should &amp; it‚Äôs to late to change. Their actions or inaction in office speak for them. They have their cult base &amp; that‚Äôs it! Trump‚Äôs a loose cannon that GOP &amp; Executive Staff cannot control. His narcissistic behaviors prove Trump‚Äôs mentally unfit to be President.
I wanna know what trump supporters are gonna do once he is out of office whether it‚Äôs now or in 4 years? Your entire personality is tied to a single human who has at most 4 years left in power. What will they become next?

I THINK TRUMP'S LOST HIS MIND!
Thank you for proving again that he didn't call the virus a hoax.  February 28th we had no idea about this virus.  Pelosi was telling people to go to China Town.  Cuomo was telling people to go to the movies.  Trump was implementing travel bans.  Wake up.
No one is attacking him and praising his death. It‚Äôs just ironic that Trump claimed this whole thing was a hoax and something curable by Hydroxychlorocline and disinfectants. His death is an indictment of Trump and his outrageous lies.

This claim has been thoroughly debunked, yet TDS idiots like you keep pushing it. Trump referred to the Dems politicking on the virus as a hoax, not the virus itself.
98% of our representatives including you Trump are an EMBARRASSMENT!!
And now he's dead. His Twitter feed is an endless nasty rant against Democrats. He was a nasty partisan, probably self (Black)-loathing, and he paid dearly for his sycophancy to Trump. Who's using Black people, Mr. Cain? A favorite theme of his to attack Dems. #HermanCain #karma
I can‚Äôt believe Trump didn‚Äôt pay his respects to John Lewis.   Im watching to hear Obama speak. I need to hear from my Presdient today.   I can‚Äôt wait until Trump dies. Let‚Äôs just throw him into a mass grave with the 150,000 Americans he killed.

Any idea which news item Trump is trying to obscure with the stupid bullshit about election delays?  1. 32.9% economic contraction  2. Swann interview on Russian bounties 3. John Lewis funeral  My guess is the funeral. He views his absence as a slight, and the attendees a threat.
Shocking. Sobering. Is that what President Trump meant by American carnage?
Based on his post-Trump verbal diarrhea, I have serious doubts about how sincerely "pro-life" French is or has been. I suspect he saw it merely as another opportunity to grift, as so many of his NT pals have demonstrated how they saw it.
Delay of the election is the only way for sure, 100%, that Donald Trump isn‚Äôt President past 1/20/2021. He‚Äôs bluffing. I call.

God Bless the unions and the teachers for having the intelligence to realize that is the right thing to do.  Florida already filed lawsuits to stop our terrible Gov from killing kids for trump.  We had our highest death count yesterday and hospitalizations are through the roof.
Just another idiotic statement made by a racist, brainwashed Karen. Stop watching Fox it's turning your reality upside down and backwards. Yes, Trump did say correctly  "Can we inject people with bleach"?  He is unable to acknowledge the enormity of the loss of lives from Covid

Trump‚Äôs ridiculous phone call with a Republican senator was recorded ‚Äî and given to The New York Times ‚Äì Raw Story
Rep. John Lewis was a great American and a great man. I don't see you mourning him. Herman Cain supported Donald Trump and look where it got him. Dead.
Those comments are inappropriate &amp; totally unnecessary at this time. Whatever your opinions about Trump or political disagreements with him were, this is NOT the time to talk about him repenting before his tragic passing. God bless the Cain family, friends, etc...

The Donald Trump Presidency.
Juan Williams saying Trump is a sore loser is amazing considering he‚Äôs 1-0 in elections so literally he has never lost.
Yesterday trump was trying to scare people from black and brown people who could possibly move into their neighborhoods and lower their house prices, today he wanted to postpone the election and this is your message?
Greatings brothers, would it be too much to ask for a min of you time or a reshare ?
I rarely, if ever, swear in public, Twitter or Facebook. But I find myself swearing at the TV when GOP goons like Gym Jordan, Doug Collins, Mnuchin, Nunes, and, of course, their Idiot-in-Chief Trump open their mouths. No one else makes my blood boil as much as they do. üòñ üò°

You honestly believe there is no possibility of voter fraud with millions of ballots floating around?   What if GOP wins, are you still going to take that position?  Is this exactly why Trump is making these statements? To take away Left arguments of ‚Äúfraud‚Äù once he wins?  ü§≠ü§îüßê
I have sleep issues, but they're more likely caused by my spending too much time on Twitter rather than worrying about the pandemic! üò≥ üôÑ And my addiction to Twitter is totally the result of following the resistance to Trump's disastrous administration. üò°
Lewis showed nothing but contempt for President Trump, why should he bother?
So, so sad. Herman Cain contracted COVID-19 at Trump‚Äôs rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma where social distancing signs were removed by Trump campaign staffers and masks were not required. I hope you‚Äôre proud of yourself, Mr. President. Cain‚Äôs death was a result of YOUR negligence.
Thanks! I must assume, then, that you recognized the character played by Robert Duvall in that pic and the implied connection to my joke about Eric Trump, n'est ce pas? Hope you chuckled to yourself! üòé
I sense desperation in the air....your years as an enabler to Donald Trump are costing you.
Very apparent, Trump will never be called eulogize anyone....besides, will they let him out of prison to do it.
Think about this one. I have seen every past president be able to cite Bible verses like Obama did in today‚Äôs eulogy. But never once from Trump. What a fraud.
Obama‚Äôs eulogy was very inspiring. I miss a President who can deliver an inspirational message that is positive and filled with unity and hope. We lost something precious when we got saddled with Trump.
I want all trump administration gone ASAP and GOP. They are all scum. The ride has been very bad. Killing Americans should have been stopped. We stopped being USA. A lot of people need to lose their jobs in the next administration. FBI and CIA and generals. All at the top.
doesn't care, he's a loyalist.  But he better be careful, those close to Trump are testing positive and now sadly dying. I do not know if DeSantis has any health issues other than being overweight. Maybe his  family can be of influence for his sake if not for ours
WOW! what a service #JohnLewisMemorial . What I am curious to know is why Trump was not at the services? As a leader of this country he should have been there.
And Trump has the audacity to offer condolences to Mr. Cain's grieving family without taking responsibility for hosting a senseless rally during a global pandemic.
Makes you wonder what President Trump is actually up to doesn‚Äôt it? I trust
And nobody knew it until ‚ÄúProfessor‚Äù Trump told us.
And trump doesn't care because he has no soul!

Trump has mishandled crises, 150,000 of our fellow Americans are dead, we continue to grapple with systematic racism &amp; we have a careless BIGOT who could not care less if things got worse because he‚Äôs making them worse. Let us listen to Obama and VOTE!!!! VOTE EVERY ENABLER OUT!
Here's when it will really be fun: When an intrepid reporter asks Mad King Trump, "So, what did you think of President Obama's remarks at John Lewis' funeral?"
Here‚Äôs Herman Cain at Trump‚Äôs Tulsa Campaign Rally. No mask. No social distancing. Very likely contracted COVID by foolishly following you...Blood on your hand!!!
This tweet was actually too dumb to be 4th Dimensional Chess. The Constitution is rather firm about this, so this has to be part of Trump‚Äôs fiendishly clever plan to Make Biden Lucid Again...
I'm Donald J. Trump and I approve this message.
Did anyone put a clock on how long it took Mad King Trump to mention John Lewis after his death?
Given the way he's running his campaign, you have to wonder:  What does the President have on Donald J. Trump?
Donald Trump.
You have to keep in mind that Trump's biggest supporters are Nazis &amp; white supremacists.  These people love his racism.  He's one of them.  Has anyone ever checked his closet for his white hood &amp; robe?
No it‚Äôs in the constitution that both houses must approve it first.  The spanish flu was worse more deaths it didn‚Äôt get postponed. Trump definitely cannot do it.
BOOM!!!
Trump and Barr are unconstitutional thugs running Stormtroopers in cities, yet many want a national mask mandate and Federal law enforcement out there arresting people not wearing. Bet if a guy got gassed,  beat and dragged off by cops for no mask they would cheer it
No. It‚Äôs really bad. Like Stephanie Meyers wrote 2020. Like trump is the emotional immature Edward and we are all Bella.
What I would expect on  tonight. Top story will be a live report from the NY pizza restaurant that trump tweeted out. In the 57th minute, there will be a snippet of video of Obama, Bush and Clinton speaking at John Lewis service
Even if delayed, Trump still leaves office at noon on January 20th, 2021. Absolutely nothing changes that.
Trump could never give a speech/eulogy because he can't talk about anyone but himself.  I love and miss Obama so much!!
Ask him if he knew this please National Debt Has Increased $5.2 Trillion During Trump's 3 Years as President

No offense, but he brought this on himself. Basically trump killed him along w/well over 150,000 other Americans. Or do the others not count? You never seem to mention them.

When a toddler done get his way.  They will say anything until they get there way.  We should  all vote by mail.  It's safe and easier for everyone.   I forgot Russia and hack into mail in voting.  Wondering if thats why Trump want to stop it.
Just a thought. If Trump got his way and ‚Äòdelayed‚Äô the election, both Trump and Pence would constitutionally be out of office on Jan 20. The Speaker, 3rd in line, would become Acting Madam President Pelosi. Pass it on.
If Trump had mandated masks at his Tulsa rally, Herman Cain would still be alive.
Forgiving George Wallace. He apologized to John Lewis, while Trump will never apologize for his racism and bigotry!

Heels up Harris. Fraud liar and cheat. Vote for Trump and Straight Republican in 2020.
What happened to Herman Cain was predicted.  Trump knew it would happen to a percentage of attendees.  That‚Äôs why he made them sign a liability waiver.  He was ok with it as long as he got to have his rally.  I can‚Äôt understand why both sides aren‚Äôt outraged.
Imbecil, that's why Trump did prison reform, because police, including elite FBI, bully people into taking a plea. They do it to minorities too often or any one who is their enemy. These agencies have too much power.
Sounds like Trump is trying to cheat by electronic voting and vote by mail blocks that.
Please stay on this Stephanie. This may be one of the worst flagrant abuses since Trump has been in office. And why? it makes NO sense shy of profiteering...the question that is everything is who knew on Monday? Who acted? This is not something even Barr can simply brush away.
But not in a racist way.  Someone is going to show me how the lives of Trump voters who wait all day to see him freestyle on the mic....have inproved since 2016.  They look like the same dirt poor inbred Whites I would see when we drove by the trailer park.
This is called voter suppression folks. Trump is going to lose and he knows it.
It‚Äôs fairly clear that he chose to vilify the science behind mask use to please Trump. He put his faith in a charlatan rather than the true experts. That loyalty ultimately cost him his life.
Trump led Herman Cain to the gates of Hell.
This is a very nice tribute from President Trump.

It is amazing how little self-awareness Trump has that he would call Biden a "buffoon". Biden is self-effacing, humble, humorous, riant, generous, spirited, fit, loving, a goofy grandpop, a kind (if not overly permissive) father, a supportive &amp; proud husband. His friendships are

By adding a question mark, Trump did not thereby change the necessary implication of his tweet, i.e. that the election should be postponed. Punctuation does not make an affirmative statement into a question if the meaning is otherwise clear.

we only vote Trump in my FL suburbs
Congrats   Another new record.  I bet if you keep opening more things you can kill more people!  Trump is so proud of how many people you have killed.
Think about this one. I have seen every past president be able to cite Bible verses like Obama did in today‚Äôs eulogy. But never once from Trump. What a fraud.
Obama‚Äôs eulogy was very inspiring. I miss a President who can deliver an inspirational message that is positive and filled with unity and hope. We lost something precious when we got saddled with Trump.
Anybody seen Trump today?  No. I thought not.
doesn't care, he's a loyalist.  But he better be careful, those close to Trump are testing positive and now sadly dying. I do not know if DeSantis has any health issues other than being overweight. Maybe his  family can be of influence for his sake if not for ours
Very SAD that now the Cowardly Liar Dotard Trump is asking COVID-19 patients for blood. Appropriate after trying to take away their health care, unemployment, food stamps, and jobs. Way to go asshole  Trump.
According to Cowardly Liar Dotard Trump,  DeSantis and  Gohmert, Republicans should not wear a face mask in public for fear of catching the COVID-19 virus, and should gather in large groups and share loud personal discussions in solidarity.
Judging by my Twitter timeline, I think I may be the only one who is quite pleased that Trump didn‚Äôt go to John Lewis‚Äô funeral.
Trump Can‚Äôt Delay the Election‚ÄîSo He‚Äôs Trying to Make It a Chaotic Mess  because you don‚Äôt have the votes.  You don‚Äôt have the votes. You don‚Äôt have the votes. Yeahhhhhhh
Trump is so uneducated and ignorant he wouldn‚Äôt understand anything President Obama said in his eulogy. Trump has about 5 nouns and 10 pronouns and 3 verbs in his vocabulary.
And Trump has the audacity to offer condolences to Mr. Cain's grieving family without taking responsibility for hosting a senseless rally during a global pandemic.
Congratulations on another day of record cases and deaths in Florida because you're a fucking idiot like your mentor Cowardly Liar Dotard   Trump.
Vote red or this is what will be running the country. Trump 2020.

Are you also wondering how many regular, ordinary, non-public figures also died as a result of the ill-advised Trump Tulsa rally that killed Herman Cain?  There are certainly others.
You and ur father scare me trump.
Trump is a sad little man. Probably upset because absolutely no one wanted him there today. #PettyAsFuck
I don't think it's going to happen anyway but if Trump delays the election it may not trigger the mechanism that seats Nancy Pelosi. I think that she only becomes President if there isn't a result but an election has to take place?

Trump is a disgrace.  He should be removed from office.  I

Trump did a major disservice to the family of PFC Vanessa Guillen by having an event on the day of John Lewis's funeral and at the hour of President Obama's eulogy. They deserve to have their story heard. There is no way that the meeting had to be today.
Trump has mishandled crises, 150,000 of our fellow Americans are dead, we continue to grapple with systematic racism &amp; we have a careless BIGOT who could not care less if things got worse because he‚Äôs making them worse. Let us listen to Obama and VOTE!!!! VOTE EVERY ENABLER OUT!
Given the way he's running his campaign, you have to wonder:  What does the President have on Donald J. Trump?
Trump tweets to bypass the press. He has said so himself. If his plan was to troll the press he has ample opportunity to troll them directly.
Trump and Barr are unconstitutional thugs running Stormtroopers in cities, yet many want a national mask mandate and Federal law enforcement out there arresting people not wearing. Bet if a guy got gassed,  beat and dragged off by cops for no mask they would cheer it

Even if delayed, Trump still leaves office at noon on January 20th, 2021. Absolutely nothing changes that.
Trump could never give a speech/eulogy because he can't talk about anyone but himself.  I love and miss Obama so much!!
Got a plan for you Marco. You‚Äôre a political opportunist. Send a signal to Trump that you would delay the presidential elections. What the heck! He‚Äôll be pleased with you and you‚Äôre presidential aspersions will continue since it‚Äôs not about integrity for you, it‚Äôs about you.

The fact that Trump is trying to delay the election which he can't do shows how horrified he is that he's going to lose. We have him scared. Now let's do the one thing that he and his republican billionaire goons can't stop. VOTE. VOTE. VOTE.

Trump 2020. If you want communism vote the other way. Government controlled every aspect of your life.
Trump attended a fundraiser in Texas without a mask on the day the US hit 150,000 coronavirus deaths. In addition to all his bad qualities, he's a hypocrite too.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Please no one tell Trump that if there's no president elected by January 20th then Nancy Pelosi becomes president until one is elected. His reaction will be priceless.
Trump could hand Putin the nuclear codes in the middle of Fifth Avenue, and his supporters would still vote for him.
Herman Cain's death is on Trump's head. Cain got this at the Tulsa rally. Another good man lost due to  ineptitude.
Trump floats November election delay - but he can‚Äôt do that:  someone should give Trump copy of Constitution to read.
I agree with the statement however, Trump encourages his "followers" to endanger themselves and in doing so all of us.

So self respecting woman votes for Trump.  Every mom I know is sick and tired of the dangerous and divisive DJT bullshit train and will be voting straight blue this year.    ...and I'll be looking forward to seeing #denialdonald removed forcefully on  inauguration day.
Heels up Harris. Fraud liar and cheat. Vote for Trump and Straight Republican in 2020.
What happened to Herman Cain was predicted.  Trump knew it would happen to a percentage of attendees.  That‚Äôs why he made them sign a liability waiver.  He was ok with it as long as he got to have his rally.  I can‚Äôt understand why both sides aren‚Äôt outraged.
Imbecil, that's why Trump did prison reform, because police, including elite FBI, bully people into taking a plea. They do it to minorities too often or any one who is their enemy. These agencies have too much power.
Sounds like Trump is trying to cheat by electronic voting and vote by mail blocks that.
It‚Äôs fairly clear that he chose to vilify the science behind mask use to please Trump. He put his faith in a charlatan rather than the true experts. That loyalty ultimately cost him his life.
Trump led Herman Cain to the gates of Hell.
This is a very nice tribute from President Trump.

The color of evil is putrid Orange to think a president could actually delay the elections is ridiculous? Trump you have no power to delay the election! It won't happen! You might try to sue 36 or 37 States when you lose to Joe Biden but it won't work! #dumpTrump

Disagree. I may disagree with a lot of Republican stances, but my disdain for Trump has nothing to do with partisanship. He's by far the worst president of my lifetime and that's enough to get me voting the other way.  In 4 years we can try again with the liberal candidate.

Today many Republican congressmen will be asked about Trump's tweet and they will all have mysteriously not seen it.
Trump sent out the tweet just as the historically low GDP numbers crossed the wires. His failure to manage the health of the country has caused massive failure in the economy. And now he has nothing to run on other than spreading division and fear if the "others".
YEP, THERE IS 5,000 REASON NOT TO VOTE FOR TRUMP...ONE IS HIS IQ IS 40, HE DOES NOT READ, TAKES NO BRIEFING, CALLS PEOPLE UGLY DISGUSTING NAMES LIKE A 5-YEAR-OLD BULLY, HAS NO SENSE OF DIRECTION, AND HE LOVES DICTATORS. THES ARE JUST A FEW...THE LIS GOES ON AND ON.
Pointing to other countries does not negate that Mad King Trump screwed the pooch and sold the pups.   ALSO: More racism, another attack on MSM, and a whole heaping helping of Whataboutism.   Mad King Trump sure packs a whole lot of shit into a bag that only holds 280 characters.
Trump tweeted the election stuff right as the GDP calculation comes out because he‚Äôs the worst president ever and still doesn‚Äôt have an actual plan to fix this country he‚Äôs just preserving his own wealth and power.
Then why is Trump doing nothing to show proof and make it available?

Yes, some rich people born being rich, but I'm not talking about those, I'm talking about people like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs, people that innovated. I'm not talking about pigs like Donald Trump
It was fun.  Seeing someone like Trump completely botch simple answers was quite fun and it'll be just as good the second time.

Trump denied it, the  UK denied it, no US or UK Government officials said anything. Plus, the UK Government has nothing to do with the location of the Open. and the R and A was never contacted, the organization that does. Non-story, then again, it is the "anonymous source" Times.

Experts dismiss Trump claim that it could take 'years' to declare election winner
Every traditional Republican understands that mail in / absentee voting is a Republican strong point.    But trump  was  a Democrat all his life, so of course he does not understand that.
Well, I‚Äôm glad you are coming around... please &amp; always, vote... Voting by mail has been done for a long long time and has less than .002% of fraud‚Äîthe only reason Trump doesn‚Äôt want vote by mail is because if people vote, he loses!

He passed away from the Trump Virus. After the first 5K deaths Trumps owns the virus and every victim's thereafter, including Herman Cain passing.
It‚Äôs because those reporters were chosen to ask those questions. Anyone with balls enough to ask about putin bounties or trump‚Äôs epic failure on c19 might receive an angry tweet or lose access. Oh the horror.
Does Trump even realize that older people get their insulin and other very important medications via the USPS. They have done this month after month and their lives depend on it.
Getting rid of kushner is just as important as ousting trump.  The Biden team needs to campaign on the entire team of asshats that will be gone when he‚Äôs elected. It‚Äôs a huge selling point.
Herman Cain did not believe in wearing a mask, Trump did believe in wearing a mask.  Wearing a mask protects you from getting the virus, not completely but it help's tremendously.  He died because of the virus and supporting Trump's belief's #TrumpKillsAmericans
Of course he is. Trump is going to undermine the results and declare himself the winner. Welcome to authoritarian rule! Democracy and the USA is finished.

Too late, he sat by and did nothing while Trump betrayed his oath, our country and allies.
Remember over the spring many ‚Äúprimaries‚Äù got delayed/changed to accomodate the shut down. State govs may be inclined to change election dates/mail by dates in an effort to ‚Äúaccomodate‚Äù (ie: round up) voters.   Trump knows whatever he proposes Dems will be against. HydroxyC, etc.
That didn't age well.. I don't want to speak ill will of the dead but he was a grown man that chose to ride or die with this hoax and paid for it. he literally died for Trump.

I would call it more of a Nazi rally. You were still able to work with Nazi's even if you're on the wrong side. A lot of Trump's tactics are Nazi-like especially the past 2-3 months. Klan is just more of entitled and very narrow-minded White people.. not a real movement.
Yes. And that is why so many deaths are on Trump. If he had modeled and emphasized mask wearing and discouraged the push to reopen so fast fewer people would have died.
Imagine if the Republicans did that for the first two years of Trump, Now maybe you might want to reconsider that change? Harry Reed did it for all judges other than Supreme Court. Republicans than included the Supreme Court. How did that work out for you?
I mean he died from the virus... who cares if it's from the rally or not... honestly it's his fault as much as its Trump's fault.. you have to be a fucking idiot to go to a rally where you know most aren't smart enough to wear masks.

If he got help from his gubernatorial allies... we'd end up with a situation where only Blue states vote.  That would not be the outcome Trump wants. It's possible Biden could get to 270 without the deep Red states voting. Trump digs chaos, but not chaos where he loses big.

. we're coming for you. Each and every one of you. We will crawl over broken glass to vote. We will wear hazmat suits to vote. We will stand in line for 9 hours to vote. On Nov 3, we will annihilate the Trump Republican Party. We're taking back our country. GTF out of our way
RIP to #HermanCain who died from COVID after attending a Trump rally without a mask. Not intending this as a ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù at all, but a plea to anti-maskers to maybe reconsider the whole mask thing.
See Trump is corrupt and hateful going against our Constitution! Protesters have legal rights they were not doing anything wrong but protesting against something the Trump Dictator didn‚Äôt agree with equal rights BLMüëéü§•
I was just seeing if the person saying one person is hateful was also capable of determining if Trump was also hateful. Its called being bias, not being able to be impartial. How does me asking a question implies hatred? Even if I was fishing for a impartial opinion?

Hey Palmer, maybe you could help me with this question... at the end of August 2016 Hillary was leading Trump in almost every major poll and we all know what happened at the end... how can we be sure that‚Äôs not going to happen again?
Parents aren‚Äôt going to send their children to slaughter for you and who you pray to (Trump). You decided to listen to the lies about the virus ü¶† from Trump and his enablers. You reap what you sow. You are following the Herman Cain path.
And yet the Trump Death Cult refuses to face the implications of his death squarely and instead are doubling down on their idiotic Covid mythology and butthurt about libs being means to them.
He‚Äôs a fraud plain and simple.....Can‚Äôt believe Trump keeps him
How the hell does Trump keep this fraud?..very discouraging
Trump and GOP running up $3.7 trillion deficit this year.
Today Trump suggested delaying the election. Obama was reinforcing John Lewis' belief "When you see something that is not right, you must do something," "Democracy is not a state. It is an act, and each generation must do its part."
And Trump voters are conservative, so what does that make him? Your claim was specious and an attempt to discredit the original point, which is that by and large Republicans and far right groups are the biggest pushers re: reopening/masks are ineffective/covid conspiracies.
Them they criticize Trump at Rose Garden
Q: Did Herman Cain tweet that masks would not be required at Trump's controversial Tulsa rally? And was that tweet subsequently deleted?  A: Yes.
Trump is more afraid of early voting üó≥ then the actually Election Dayü§î but want worried about it in 2016 ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
The more people who get sick, the more of an excuse Trump and Barr will have to try and postpone or suspend the election. Remember, has no bottom and will do anything to win. Cynical? Perhaps...

As a Trump supporter how can you defend making voting harder.  You can want your guy to win, but ar what cost?!  What country do you live in if it totally ignores the value of voting?!
for the love of  can someone tell trump how to pronounce "plasma"  its not plausema
so I'm guessing trump wasn't at the funeral.....
Amazing how you and Cain and Trump and conservatives can say whatever they want, no matter how despicable, but God forbid someone criticizes a conservative, she is labeled hateful, no matter how valid the criticism. Look in the mirror.
And MBS as well, but I totally agree about Putin too. Trump is coddling all the foreign dictators &amp; tyrants from North Korea, to   Russia, to Saudi. Time to shut down Rizvi &amp; Milner. Don‚Äôt let these foreign tyrants buy up our social media. Down with fascism! #bringbackbetter
Thank you, Obama!! Obama, eulogizing John Lewis, takes aim at Trump over voting rights, protest response
He died from the Trump Virus. You neglected to write that.
Rest in peace Herman Cain. Hopefully others will learn from your misplaces trust in Trump.
Doesn't take nerve,nor are they unaware or unconcerned.....they are the lowest common denominators a.k.a. ignorant racist trump supporters
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.

Right, because when Lewis boycotted BOTH Bush's and Trump's inaugurationa he was working to bring people together?
I actually think the humiliating loss would lead to him not really returning to the job for those two months. His only agenda is ‚ÄúTrump.‚Äù He doesn‚Äôt care about what Mitch might want.   I think he‚Äôll spend December stuffing money into suitcases and arranging to leave the USA.

Obama makes Trump look like a damn fool.
Congress been asking for Trump taxes for 4 years. Nigga just said ‚Äúnah, y‚Äôall can‚Äôt see that‚Äù. And nothing happened. He gonna do what he want with this election.
Yea and I‚Äôm sure the 8 Trump campaign staffers who contracted COVID shortly after the Tulsa Rally must‚Äôve gotten it from somewhere else too. Regardless I guarantee that he and those around him did not wear masks or take the virus seriously which still makes it ironic and foolish
You are losing your hold on the Republican Party!!!  #sad #DementiaDon

Not if it‚Äôs that crazy lady that is touting hydroxycloraquin which is shown to do more harm than good for COVID. Trump has a stake in the company that produces is; a Saudi company based in Malta where patent law is non existent. Trump is trying his best to move America backwards!

All those jobs lost are his fault? No. They are you and your ilks fault who refuse to fuckin do anything. But again, all Trump's fault. His whole presidency was job creation and then re-election comes around and suddenly everybody "loses" their job by quitting work.
Don't come at me with "his ego won't allow it" or that nonsense. The reality is Trump has always quit when things haven't gone his way. It's a consistent pattern throughout his entire life. Why would this be any different?
Ha ha tRump! You are so far behind in the polls, it would take more than a miracle for you to win. Since you don‚Äôt like losing, why don‚Äôt you just drop out of the race now so the GOP can at least put in a viable candidate.

I spent years working on GOP campaigns in several states, &amp; GOTV field work for conservative PACs. Especially in states like FL w/ many elderly voters, absentee ballots are a major tactical focus for any GOTV plan.  Trump discouraging his own voters from voting by mail is INSANE.
Trump is former Governor George Wallace!  #TrumpVirus.
Indeed I am, which is why I will always fight the Left, which hates our Constitution and undermines it constantly. It's the Left that believes the Constitution is "living and breathing," which is short for "it can be redefined." Trump's judicial appointments disagree.
I‚Äôll take my first trump check whenever you get a chance Donny. If you just wanna attach it to the second one that comes out that will be fine.
I get it, but here's the thing. Politicians like Biden, Clinton &amp; Obama set the stage for people to elect Trump. If Biden gets elected, he will set the stage for someone far worse, like Tom Cotton. Who is just as fascist, but the press will roll over for because he's in the club.
Guys. Something has changed recently. In several of my group chats where I am the lefty and a boomer is present, previously apolitical (like G Johnson 2016) center right guys my age have started in on Trump and the boomers keep thinking that I am the one spamming the group chat.

why do you allow the president to continue to lie about mail-in voting?  Are you trying to get Trump re-elected?  Stop airing this bullshit!

It‚Äôs typical trump bullshit deflection and distraction - this time from increasing deaths from C-19 and appalling economic news. He has no power to delay it, date is set by Congress not the president and in any event, per the constitution, his term ends at noon on Jan 20, 2021.
I missed Trump's tweet demanding the release of this man from Russia. It's out there, right?
Oh ugh, Trump's now back to dismissing this because the average age of those who die is in their 70s. I'm not willing to sacrifice my Mom and Dad. They are being as safe as is reasonably possible but there's no guarantee.

You and your colleagues have learned nothing since the 2016 election and you are making the same damned stupid mistakes now that you made then. YOU STOP covering every damned, breath, step, and fart trump makes. They are nothing but distractions that you all keep falling for.

If kids can go to school, the election can be on time.  Mailing in your ballot is not any different than absentee voting so, quit with that trump lie!
Herman Cain‚Äôs death reminds me of this apt description from  about how seemingly competent people get pulled down by folks like Trump. In Cain‚Äôs case, the ultimately consequence was death.
"Masks will not be mandatory for the event, which will be attended by President Trump.¬†PEOPLE ARE FED UP!" Cain tweeted (about T's Mount Rushmore rally) the day before he was hospitalized.
It's unclear how Cain contracted COVID-19. He tested positive for the disease 11 days after attending a campaign rally for Trump in Tulsa. Cain tweeted out a photo of himself at the rally where neither he, nor those surrounding him, were wearing masks
How about media stops chasing every shiny object Trump tosses out there? Are you kittens or discerning professionals? Sheesh! Not helping!
Dropping my ballot off to ensure it gets there. Tired of criminals being at the too of our government. If nothing else Trump has exposed those in power that don't believe in our country.

We need a truthful president, not one that lies all of the time.  Trump is stupid, liar, corrupt and a despicable person.  Thank you Republicans!

I‚Äôm *never* voting for Trump. All your ugly behavior accomplished is make me dislike*you*.  When all this is over, my conscience will be clear. Will yours? Will you feel content knowing you sent insults or spread lies about former friends because they wouldn‚Äôt vote for Trump? 2/2
Funny thing about Republicans who weren‚Äôt originally Trump supporters but who‚Äôve decided to vote for him this year...my refusal to join them is absolutely infuriating. The amount of abuse, harassment, &amp; even threats I‚Äôve gotten has spiked up again this year. 1/2
I don‚Äôt see much proof in this. But there is proof that Trump knew of Russian bounties on US troops and instead of doing something about it, he actually requested having Russia JOIN the G7 (which was denied by Germany)
Nice!! Did you know that Trump knew for months that Russia has bounties on US troops and instead of doing something about it he recently tried to get Russia into the G7 (which Germany rejected). Doesn‚Äôt seem very pro-veterans to me
Unpopular opinion: if you think that the democrats - or the republicans - are the solution, you're doing it wrong. We've got a chance to get real people in &amp; people thinking Joe Biden or Donald Trump are actually going to solve problems #smh

Even an imbecilic monkey is better than Trump.
Trump/Putin -Bounty .  was finding a pic of Dog the Bounty Hunter and was going to make a snarky comment/meme about this. I did not. This is far too serious for jokes. This is treasonous behavior and shows how he regards our troops in harms way. He doesn't regard them .
Disinformation to distance Trump from the 152k  dead. There are 3 ongoing disinfo campaigns: 1) Most would‚Äôve survived if they had used these drugs B) Rise in cases is due to intentional errors to get more $ for  the  hospitals III) Many  of  the  deaths  are  miscoded for $
The tweet of the day. It shows Trump‚Äôs incompetence. And his covering up. The Russians invaded Afghanistan to take it over. USA went in because attacks in the USA originated from there. He makes it equivalent and gives Putin a pass. Russia is dangerous and running all over us
You are the one in desperate need of tutoring in basic business and finance. Navarro is just a Trump lackey with no real ideas.
Interview with Johnathan Swan trump admitted that he did not raise the issue of bounties with putin because it is fake news.
Even if trump manages to win somehow, if democrats can take the house and senate, he will lose a lot of eneablement.

No... I credited Obama with the decrease in unemployment from 2008 to 2016. After that it was Trump‚Äôs economy since he took office in January 2017, which is why I credited him with bringing unemployment down 1%. It‚Äôs his fault now because he‚Äôs the sitting president.

Are you awake! Trump is a dictator. He used our military against our own people for a photo opt. Our general called him out for it. He goes after black lives matter and let‚Äôs his goons stand in front of a court house with ar-15s and says liberate. You wake up

The economy contracted by 32.9% in Q2  Is America now ready to give Trump credit for finding a balance between saving covid-19 and avoiding economic apocalypse?  Our economy would have tanked. He saved lives and gave us an economic future As usual ..Trump got it right

he's not cross-examining him correctly he shouldn't let him get a word in that son of a b**** pig f***** Evangelical idiot is screwing up this country  and now he's going to declare the bar is going to decide about our elections he's triangulating with Trump

Just a horrible deal. Perhaps Trump is laboring under the assumption that Kodak, shorn of its technology edge and top thinkers, is the company he remembers from the 60s
Hard to argue with that, I suppose. If we‚Äôve learned anything about Trump, it‚Äôs that he‚Äôs not a details guy. And secondarily, he‚Äôs not a big picture guy. #hmmmm
Trump is a monster!  His constant deflection and reference to Covid 19 as the China Virus makes my blood boil!
Keep them in ghettos right Donald, low income people are Americans also. You are disgusting. Your dad made your millions by building low income housing in cities, you loved it then! It‚Äôs fear your selling, be it crime, housing,anything. You are a low life!

Trump claims that the 2020 election is ‚Äúrigged,‚Äù hours before he claims he will win the election ‚Äúbig.‚Äù  Doesn‚Äôt that mean that Trump is rigging the election in his favor? Just asking for a friend, named Joe Biden.

Trump is now saying the election is rigged, but he is also claiming he will win.  The only conclusion we can draw if he is correct, is that he‚Äôs rigging the election.
I think you owe  an apology for this article on 4/24.  It hasn‚Äôt aged well.
Donald Trump knows that intrinsically  He hates people that are smarter than him, that are more moral than him... He hates successful people that made their money honestly he hates those people with a passion
So you prefer Facism? That is the road Trump is going down.  I prefer the Democracy we already have and Trump and the GOP are trying to destroy!
How about an angry crowd of 200,000 gathers in Washington DC and overwhelms the White House and whisks Trump out so that he may find his destiny...

It is not truth or even factual, it is a assumption, and is a irresponsible statement from a known Trump hater.
This is good news because dropping all charges was the Trump/Barr agenda, right? (Sorry, a bit behind w/this atrocious Trump scandal)

It‚Äôs legitimacy was destroyed when Trump took office, but yes, I understand your point.

Bickering for months until Supreme Court rules due to confusion it wasn‚Äôt a fair election. Trump and Barr repeat every time election rescheduled. Civil War ensues, sadly our democracy dies along with 500,000 innocent Americans due to COVID.
People are vile &amp; most are bond servants to to partisanship. Man, the comments. üòû 1) People that wear masks and stay home are still dying. Ask me how I know.  2) The virus doesn‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre meeting for a ‚Äúrally‚Äù or a protest.  3) They‚Äôre more like Trump than they realize
Public announcements from both sides continue and sow confusion in the electorate. Many Trump voters stay home and GOP heavy election locations do not open. Dems show up in force on Election Day and in mail in ballots to give Biden decisive landslide. Trump won‚Äôt concede.
Sounds to me that a likely scenario is Trump and Barr ‚Äúannounce‚Äù in late October the election is being delayed due to COVID safety concerns (which Trump has of course ignored COVID up to this point). Congress clearly asserts its power to squash the idea.
Everything trump touches eventually dies
Yeah. No. That's your wheelhouse. I mean it's got to be tough. You're wrong. About everything. You're stupid but you think you're smart. You imagine yourself a patriot, but deep down you know by supporting Trump you're a traitor. Of course you hate yourself.
Dude. He went to a trump rally, bragged about how he would not wear a mask, caught covid-19, suffered for a month, and died. You idiots are so bent on owning the libs, that you'll dream up conspiracy theories as you die, never admitting you might have been wrong.

TDoctor says ‚Äòpathetic‚Äô Trump is either suffering from ‚Äòincurable madness‚Äô or he‚Äôs intentionally trying to manipulate Americans | Raw Story  via rawstory
In April, Biden said, ‚ÄúI think Trump is gonna try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can't be held.‚Äù  Trump's campaign called his comments "incoherent, conspiracy theory ramblings of a lost candidate"  Today Trump suggested we delay the election
as much as I dislike Donald Trump, some of the responsibilities if not most of it goes to Ron DeSantis our lame governor.
Thank you Mr President Trump's.
I think I may vomit. Trump has no leadership ability at all but he does very well at living in a magical world in his mind detached from reality. He has narcissistic personality disorder and he is a sociopath.
Worst üëèüèº quarter üëèüèº ever üëèüèº as a result of the complete mismanagement of the pandemic by Trump. This is the #BiggestFailureInHistory and the people are hurting.
Trump gonna leave kicking and screaming. Just how they planned this.
. Let me set the record straight  HE DID NOT GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING  He was PROVEN GUILTY  Republicans MADE AN OPEN AND SHUT CASE A political FARCE  Not RIGHT or WRONG but POLITICAL  Trump DID what he was accused of IT WAS PROVEN   Republicans Turned a blind eye All but Romney .
It‚Äôs easy to see that Democrats don‚Äôt love America. Vote Trump 2020!

Mark Zuckerberg will never stop running Trump's misleading #Facebook ads ‚Äî he makes too much money off of them. That's why federal oversight is essential. Time to investigate and act!
I do worry about fair housing for all . The color of one's skin does not determine if you should own a home . Trump ,you are the most despicable man on the par with Hitler. Rest in hell.
Anything to keep from admitting it is a possibility that he will have to leave next January. I can foresee court cases everywhere if it does not go his way...Trump suggests delaying election amid fraud claims, but has no power to do so
For all you insiders out there: Eastman Kodak up 10X after Trump announces big loan to the company.
Two days ago Trump stated, "Nobody likes me." Today he suggested that we "delay the election."  If it's not obvious to you what he's trying to do, then you are as blind as a bat.  Our Democracy is at stake and Republicans just hide under the covers like scared children.
Trump wants to delay the 2020 election.  The GOP had better grow a set of brass ones and do it quickly.
Trump suggests delaying election If he wasn‚Äôt in office he‚Äôd suggest having the election sooner. Are we really surprised, he wants to strip the Americans chance of voting?   Mail in voting isn‚Äôt new. Its been going on since the civil war!
BBC News - Donald Trump calls for delay to 2020 US presidential election
Trump Talk: All Our Best Mashups In One Video  via  Twat.
The President of the United States, really just said, "Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote"  Remember when Joe Biden said he believes Trump will try and delay the election and Republicans attacked him for it?

Pretty sure the answer to first 2 questions is no. As for #3, you‚Äôre talking about the same voters who cheered &amp; pumped their fists in victory at a rally when Trump said he was going to get rid of the estate tax, so, ....
Please note that there are NO RIOTS going on in Detroit, Cleveland or Milwaukee.  Trump is sending the Feds because he knows this will start riots in swing states.  This is a political stunt! #SuburbsForBiden.

According to Trump that means they are dangerous radical leftists. #TrumpVirusKills
Lol. Trump stole from a veterans charity.
NYPD needs to exert greater force than the rioters to quell the mayhem. Cuomo and DeBlasio cannot indict or fire the entire force for doing their job. Their anti Trump logic is hurting innocent citizens.

Watching Dems throw a temper tantrum like a 3 year old at the AG Barr hearings  Is that what you wanted when you gave Dems the house in 2018?  You have an opportunity to rectify that mistake in Nov  Trump and both houses  America has to get beyond Dem cancer and let Trump save us
I live in the suburbs.  There are plenty of people living in low-income housing.  Most of them voted for Trump in 2016.  Most of them would be homeless if not for ‚Äúlow-income housing.‚Äù  Most of them will now be voting Biden in 2020. #SuburbsForBiden
This entire narrative is so moronic but the media is full of morons so...ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Trump would pack up and live out the rest of his life as a billionaire semi-retiree with the love of his family, vacationing and unlimited golfing. This sounds lovely compared to what his life is now. üôÑ
And that's why it's so critical that America get its head out of its ass and give Trump both another term and both houses..
Making it easy for your buddy Putin, are ya Trump?
This article was quite a read. The man obviously thinks Trump is a tool but his methodical review of #hydroxycholoroquine was illuminating. Thank you for sharing the article.
Given the Democrat history of trying to corrupt elections..   Trump would be positively foolish to give them a blank check in advance by saying he would never unconditionally accept any of the shit that they manage to come up with in November.
But Valerie.. if Obama  who abused the power of the presidency to spy on Trump are not punished..  We can expect it to happen again..  That should be unacceptable..  That it's not.. is the problem
Have you noticed that TRUMP and his Cronies seem to get $ from every bill they pass? AND we still don‚Äôt know where it ALL went when they OVERSEE themselves!!! HOW did we get so many so deranged into THE WHITEHOUSE??

Trump cheats on first wife soon-to-be second wife, cheats on second wife with soon-to-be third wife, cheats on 3rd wife with pornstar while third wife is nursing son.  What's your point?The Trump administration wants $377 million in the next coronavirus relief bill to remodel the West Wing of the White House.
If you truly loved your country, you would have endorsed  . She's the real change. Biden is just a blue Trump.
ask Trump how it feels to go through life like that
Not one paper calling for the resignation of a traitor and mass murderer. Trump and DeSantis. Do your duty you cowards.
I am white and voted for President Obama then President Trump.

A write-in is prob same as a vote for Trump. In the past it wasn‚Äôt as important to vote for 1 or the other, &amp; years ago I actually wrote in in 2 diff elections. But this election is too important to waste a vote on someone who won‚Äôt win. Don‚Äôt be a coward.
They won‚Äôt rig it through mail-in ballots, that‚Äôs a fall back. They‚Äôre gonna rig it through the media. We get the results from the media. They‚Äôve been claiming now, ‚Äúwill trump accept the results‚Äù numerous times. The Media will lie and fake the results.
Bush, Cheney normalized ... Trump criticized for removing troops from Syria and Germany? Maybe he should conform the way Obama did ... the Change candidate has won 3 straight elections (so the DNC selects Biden)
Trump administration is weakening the Fair Housing Act of 1968. When Black vets returned from WWII, the GI Bill excluded them. This meant only white vets qualified for low-interest mortgages.  #BlackLivesMatter

The Federalist Society calling him out is BS. It‚Äôs an attempt to save some Congressional seats and repolish the GOP brand in light of Trump‚Äôs fading prospects. They had many opportunities to stand up for the country and passed. Not buying it.

In florida we have the right to vote by mail and absentee which trump loves. Here is something everyone misses. Florida has a law that NO vote by mail or absentee ballots can be opened or counted until election day!! Its a STATE house Republicans law to suppress the vote.
If a case can be made for George W. to be charged with murder (look it up, don't yell at me) then one would have to assume Trump would have some problems heading his way.

What this really is - is white supremacy learning to disguise itself within universally passionate issues throughout society (issues that are usually riddled with popular conspiracy theories) - These people don‚Äôt care about child sex trafficking (ob-v with the Trump gear)

Trump doesn‚Äôt believe in democracy. It‚Äôs pretty clear to anyone with a brain at this point. A vote for trump is a vote for fascism. This is what Hitler did when he took absolute power in the early 1930s.

As Florida reports record increase in deaths for the third day in a row President Trump says "Numbers are coming down, coming down very substantially. They are starting to come down in Florida"
I call fake news. Republicans have proven that when Trump says "Jump!" the Republican response is always "How high?"  The GOP will ALWAYS do Trump's bidding because the GOP is terrified of being mentioned in a tweet.
Trump just threw out a nice little night crawler and all of you that are upset took the bait. He can delay the election with Executive Directive 51. If vaccine testing is pushed back, or if Democrats ban the only known treatment, he should absolutely delay it until voting is safe

Yes, the dots connect, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they lead to right place. There are people who feel wearing a mask is wrong, regardless of what Trump says. Placing someone at a rally doesn‚Äôt mean he caught the virus there or refused the mask for any reasons but his own. Just saying.

Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for Donald Trump.
The good old days when Trump claimed Republicans lose because people put on disguises to vote illegally.  Now he is trying to blame mail-in-ballots.  Republicans lose because we can count. Trump is trying to avoid counting votes &amp; stop you from voting
And yet, he‚Äôs kicking Donald Trump‚Äôs a** in the poles!!‚Äô
That‚Äôs basically what‚Äôs been happening.  The people who refuse wear mask, without realizing it, are risking their lives for Trump.  My question to each one of them is, aside from hating the people they hate, what has Trump actually done for them?
why why why do you continue to try to rationalize Trump. He and his administration are racist despicable and he‚Äôs a dictator wannabe. Nothing to analyze.

Welcome to the resistance, Steven Calabresi.
Didn't someone once say, "Everything Trump Touches Dies?"
I dont know if I can blame Trump for his death but Trump certainly influenced him to not wear a mask and be in a large gathering. At the same time, he was an adult and is responsible for his own decisions
With the senior population more susceptible to Covid-19, mail-in ballots would actually help Trump. It's not about who's in office. I'm against blanket mailing of ballots to voters whether they requested it or not.
Hand turning in ballots needs to be yelled from the roof tops, especially with a trump sycophant heading the post office
Me second - re-watching Trump press conferences to learn to be more confrontational and blame the press rather than take responsibility. ü§°
He partied with Trump in Oklahoma!
The "worst" quarter in modern US history? Really? One that was intentionally, and knowingly done because of a pandemic? One btw that *Democrats* continue to use as a choker on the economy? Right... Trump is the one that's totally done.
We have a functional, mobilized radical left for the first time in 40 yrs. An empowered, emboldened, right wing (thanks to the influence of the Lincoln Project) Democratic Party will be the biggest threat to that. Yes, Trump bad but if Biden loses you can expect huge protests

Former President Obama you stooped to a National Low! Taking a jab at our Beloved President Trump during an eulogy for Mr. John Lewis. You know that is going to now be a part of your legacy. Disgraceful, Discussing and Shameful!

Trump is the master of deflection. Which his ‚Äúdelay the election‚Äù antic, is he deflecting from what?
Tony Green admitted that no one wore masks, saying he thought ‚Äúthe mainstream media and the Democrats were using it [COVID-19} to create panic, crash the economy and destroy Trump‚Äôs chances at re-election.‚Äù

They were announcing FROM THE BEGINNING that it was impossible to stop a virus when China was silent and lied till too many infected to stop. It didn't hurt #Trump enuf so keep going... So w/ your logic country should be locked until rushed mandated vaxes are given.?
Just like the NYT‚Äôs article about Trump and George Wallace jist happened to be published today when Obama launches the same attack at a funeral service!
Trump won‚Äôt admit it, but he won because people hated Hillary. People like Joe Biden this time around, so as long as Trump continues to be Trump, this is going to a crushing win by Biden.
Check out Ben Shapiro on Joe Rogan last week talking about this. Clinton was not ahead of Trump in Texas and It‚Äôs showing Trump and Biden within the margin of error IN TEXAS NOW. The local and national polls in 2016 were much more favorable to Trump then than they are now.
I am somewhat the same way.  My issue is with Herman Cain.  Is the world a better place?  Or say it was Trump that died.  Just sayin  If an action saves more lives than it cost.  Or! If it saves the planet?

Disgusting  the great man Herman Cain went to the rally because he wanted to, and he knew Trump is the man to lead this country.
As if you needed another reason to break up these riots &amp; arrest George Soros, Donald J. Trump! ** DAs backed by Soros, other liberal activists join fray in clash with police
If Trump watched any of it before Obama delivered the eulogy, he would see how much more of a great man, a giant of a man John Lewis was than he could ever be. How much Lewis was respected and loved, deservedly so. Wounds the fragile ego of the toddler in chief.

I call your offices' only to be hung up on or told to leave a message.  You do a great job reporting the news but nothing to protect your constituents. Also, why don't you give us your opinion on Trump's delaying the election. We need this information. Man-up!
Really, you have to be an idiot, a conspiracy theorist, a liar, or any combination there of, to continue to support Trump at this stage
Hell yeah! Make Trump pardon Flynn and then make him testify before Congress without the benefit of 5th Amendment protection.   Hold Flynn in contempt if he refuses to testify.   Flynn didn‚Äôt just lie to the  that‚Äôs simply ONE OF THE CHARGES he was allowed to plea to.

Strange you keep centering trump like he really matters at this point. Pretty sure family members of all the "at risk" ages groups would do whatever they can to have them be in their lives longer. Jobs vs loved ones is a false dichotomy.

I hope that  and  take Trump's threat to the Constitution serious. I have no faith that either of them will.
Kinda obvious if you understood trump a little better. Instead of getting to understand him and his comedic personality, you‚Äôd all rather just talk shit and hate on him. You don‚Äôt care what he meant, you only care about what you think he meant.

Trump suggests delaying election. His anti-democratic intent is no joke.

No. You misunderstand me. Y'all are basically saying that there is no valid criticism of Trump, that it's all just hate. I'm saying that y'all are lazy defending him like that. There's plenty of objective data that Trump's policies are not good for America. #NoHateJustFacts.

turnout or polling places shutting down due to lack of pollworkers because of covid19. People who aren't voting for Trump are more likely to vote by mail, because the other party is being more rational about the virus, and about mail in voting. Also, mail in voting can save time-

Something is missing in Trump. Something essential to being human. Bush made some very bad decisions and listened to some people he shouldn't have. He is a much better ex president then he was a president.
For real? I didn‚Äôt know that... wow. Rudy... you should be ashatof yourself. Like trump loves to say ‚Äúthat is nasty‚Äù. Lmao. ü§Æ
He‚Äôs the head of the Federalist society and just now says that trump is a fascist?  Wait. Haven‚Äôt we known that for three years?  The tweet this more all of a sudden turned him. Pfft.
Everything is a joke that trump says but really what happens when its not a joke none of us will ever believe in this liar in chief for anything. If his lips are moving he's Lying that's DERELICTION OF DUTY TRUMP YOU WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.

Well, I‚Äôm glad you are coming around... please &amp; always, vote... Voting by mail has been done for a long long time and has less than .002% of fraud‚Äîthe only reason Trump doesn‚Äôt want vote by mail is because if people vote, he loses!
The one that pisses me off the worst is Trump 2020...no more bullshit.  As if the last 3 1/2 years have been anything but!
Provided we elect President Trump for 4 more years, we are vulnerable to these rejects all over again in 4 more years!

It‚Äôs because those reporters were chosen to ask those questions. Anyone with balls enough to ask about putin bounties or trump‚Äôs epic failure on c19 might receive an angry tweet or lose access. Oh the horror.
Don‚Äôt you think he was tested before he was allowed so close to Trump? Herman Cain is tragedy but it‚Äôs about individual choices.
Does Trump even realize that older people get their insulin and other very important medications via the USPS. They have done this month after month and their lives depend on it.
Getting rid of kushner is just as important as ousting trump.  The Biden team needs to campaign on the entire team of asshats that will be gone when he‚Äôs elected. It‚Äôs a huge selling point.
Of course he is. Trump is going to undermine the results and declare himself the winner. Welcome to authoritarian rule! Democracy and the USA is finished.
This is why Donald Trump is president. Racists like this.
Well at least it‚Äôll backfire on trump. His approval was low during the government shutdown.
Absolutely correct, Governor DeSantis sits at the knee of Trump, both must be voted out
Trump does not care about Americans period he‚Äôs a socio pathic career narcissist and we don‚Äôt need Mary trumps book to tell us that. He‚Äôs a career liar .
Trump‚Äôs comments on rescheduling the elections convinces me further that he won‚Äôt accept the election results if he loses.
Our idiot Governor DeathSantis is listening to his master Trump. He's a darn mini Trump. He's going to get voted out.
Trump‚Äôs voter fraud and mail in voting tweets have no evidence. He is supplying false information.

Too late, he sat by and did nothing while Trump betrayed his oath, our country and allies.
Remember over the spring many ‚Äúprimaries‚Äù got delayed/changed to accomodate the shut down. State govs may be inclined to change election dates/mail by dates in an effort to ‚Äúaccomodate‚Äù (ie: round up) voters.   Trump knows whatever he proposes Dems will be against. HydroxyC, etc.
That didn't age well.. I don't want to speak ill will of the dead but he was a grown man that chose to ride or die with this hoax and paid for it. he literally died for Trump.
Trump's admiration of dictators probably getting lessons on how to take a democracy to a authoritarian dictatorship using our own judiciary and laws against us.
I believe Trump is responsible for all the COVID deaths
Dana Perino! Wasn't she the press secretary  for Bush? That was the worst administration in history...I mean until the Trump administration
The covid response was a total disaster for Trump. Instead of asserting himself as a strong leader who didn‚Äôt prescribe to the mob mentally he went along with the narrative from the shutdown imbeciles and lunatics. If anything is going to be his undoing it will be this.

I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any evidence to support your claim that Trump wants to place black people below white people. There have been no actions or statements that support that. I was trying to go straight for WHY you would perceive things that way.
Don't believe this guy; he's as anti trump as they come. "Science" is trash when the analysis is designed to come out a certain way.  #hydroxichloroquine
save the USPS. Trump will defund until there is no mail at all.
Trump said that he could shoot somebody and they'd still support him. Well he didn't need a gun in this case.
That reasoning never crossed Trump‚Äôs mind.
Pogue is an anti-trump with 100s of anti-trump tweets, including disparaging tweets about Sarah Sanders.  Which means his "analysis" has ZERO credibility. He has a clear agenda.  #Hydroxychloroquine
Here‚Äôs Herman Cain at Trump‚Äôs Tulsa Campaign Rally where he likely contracted COVID. No mask. No social distancing.  Stupidly following Donald Trump in denial of the virus... #TrumpKillsAmerica

Today Trump suggested delaying the election. Obama was reinforcing John Lewis' belief "When you see something that is not right, you must do something," "Democracy is not a state. It is an act, and each generation must do its part."

Yea and I‚Äôm sure the 8 Trump campaign staffers who contracted COVID shortly after the Tulsa Rally must‚Äôve gotten it from somewhere else too. Regardless I guarantee that he and those around him did not wear masks or take the virus seriously which still makes it ironic and foolish

Trump's mishandling an unpreparedness of the pandemic definitely makes him responsible. He should have been telling people to wear a mask and practice social distancing long ago. Instead, he encourages businesses to open too soon, resulting in another wave of Covid-19.

I doubt you have any sympathy, if you did you would of just left it at RIP, but clearly you care more about hating trump then honoring the man. He's done more than you'll ever know.
Karma‚Äôs a bitch named #trump
So everything he's done before trump is what mute, so predictable tds.
I'm not a medical professional,  but have had my fair share of dealing with peeps that exhibit  this behavior. They have to hit rock bottom. He's not quite there yet. trump will get worse. I also feel they're about to do a bait &amp; switch. Drop trump, enter in Pence.
Fact Black lives matter formed under obama, where was Blm under obama, where was Joe biden....oh yes thats right silent. When you get the vote its your responsibility to make change, the change happening now wasn't happening, sure trump has no hand in the change, but 50 years.
It is a little weird that this election is just Trump vs. Trump
So it sounds like Trump is expecting to lose the popular vote by 28 million votes.  #COVID__19 #USPS #MailInBallot #DyingForTrump #obamawasbetterateverything #SATs #fractions #marytrump

Even when trump says good things like donating plasma people will try to turn it into a negative.
i‚Äôm all for getting trump out of office but the fact y‚Äôall said ‚Äúgive me biden‚Äù is trash and exactly why our political party system is beyond flawed
So the #Trump virus is also a computer virus.  Who knew?
If Trump's done nothing else, he's made W look good.

Trump killed Herman Cain.
When you think about it, it is just extra proof that trump knew the rally was dangerous
No comparison. Trump invited thousands of people to an unnecessary rally knowing that we were in the middle of a pandemic.  Stop drinking the Fox "News" Kool aid
I have not watched tv at all today but somehow I know you are talking about Trump #TrumpViruskills

If black people mattered to dems and the media, they'd find good things to say about Herman Cain, but because he's a trump supporter that makes him less of a human apparently only worthy of being put down because he chose not to wear mask. Should he of had a mask yes.

He is not mentally fit and they know this.That is why they want Biden in Office.We Must all vote Red Trump 2020
LOL!  He's so bad at lying....#MoscowMitchMcConnell has already debunked this earlier and #Trump acts like he's the only voice on this...
Herman Cain has died from Covid 19. He was at the Tulsa rally without a mask. At what point is donald trump indicted for manslaughter?

Well I'm convinced that Trump is not capable of telling the truth!!!
Careful. Every comment you make just takes another vote away from Biden and Trump to give to Jo. Keep going üòâ
I understand. Shame we didn't meet sooner. I've been complaining about him since fall of 08 when Hillary's lawyer, Phil Berg, first brought up Mr  O's status. When he released his "birth cert" (in response to TRUMP'S challenge), we went to town pointing out multiple errors. ‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è
Democrats always take the bait. And he pinned the tweet.  Next trump will say no voter ID.
Trump is scared he will lose the genera election to Biden with his poll numbers. In his press conference he cited sources such as  saying there are potential problems in voting by mail. He does not hold the power to delay the election. Congress decides date.
Trump cannot do that. We need to vote on time and without drama......like Americans! We must now prove to the free world that we are not a fucking joke. Trump is walking on dangerous ground

Not going to happen. Period. Trump casually floated idea of delaying the presidential election set up for November 3rd. That would require an act of Congress to change &amp; they oppose it. Trump is clearly worried &amp; desperate because he's way down in polls.
Poor Joe! Delusional as usual! Trump did take decisive action and halted flights from China and he was criticized as xenophobic (which Joe might think is the fear of Xena, the Warrior Princess). The CCP, WHO &amp; CDC are the ones who blew it early.

It doesn‚Äôt matter who wins. War is coming. Liberals will riot and burn cities if Trump wins again. If Biden wins he will ban so called assault weapons and start another civil war
You don't see it. Trump is a master at playing the media, and I don't mean that nonchalantly. He's written about it in most of his books. He's dealt with the media his entire life &amp; he knows exactly what he's saying &amp; what reaction he's gonna get. Don't get mad, he's the one

Ahhhh, he could know about something major after Election Day. He definitely loves to trigger them. Dems say we can‚Äôt go back to school till no risks; therefore, Trump says can‚Äôt vote till all kinks worked out. Ha!
Trump is a Distraction &amp; a Liar... Remember That!!!
to die? Or is this what I said originally, you hijacking the death of a beloved man to blame the President? I think it's both actually, bc I don't think there is anything or anyone you wouldn't use to get your digs at Trump.
That's laughable! At least Trump can articulate an intelligent thought sans teleprompter; more than I can say for #RidinWithBiden2020. üôÑ Just #VoteTrump, Biden is no match, debates will be so much fun! Let's do this, shall we? üá∫üá∏ü¶Ö

I am glad people are believing trump's tweet. suckers take his bait all the time .
duh, Trump is f*****g with the DEMS &amp; media, especially after we all watched the Democrats ask the AG in the shit show they put on the other day. Trump is messing with them &amp; apparently one of our own is a Trump-hater too. Nice..
What about a womans right to choose abortion? This has been attacked constantly. Also, Trump is a known woman degrader.
When Trump goes to prison, he'll drag all his republican cronies right with him!!!
If you want to see some real riots, try postponing the Nov election. I don't care if we have to pull Trump's big orange butt from the white house ourselves, if he loses, his ass is gone!

I‚Äôm talking about Trump
That‚Äôs a lie the intelligent agent found out this was true this was bought to Trump desk back in spring and he done nothing
On one side, Trump cheats by asking adversaries to meddle and using his office to make it hard to vote. Then, he tells his followers the election will be filled with fraud (not his). By destroying trust on both sides, he‚Äôs truly wrecking democracy.
Isn't it weird, maybe just a strange coincidence, I don't know, that some people have used Trump to improve the legacies of people Like GWB but not President Obama?
What's scary is that Trump today suggested "delaying" November elections and you and your fellow GOP sycophants will support this betrayal of democracy because you're more motivated by your fear of kompramat than by a love for and loyalty toward our country. Shame!
I am so sad to hear Herman Cain passed.  We should have elected him President.  9/9/9 was a great plan, I think he was the friendlier version of what we got with Donald Trump, he had the same conservative principles but he just made you smile.  RIP Mr. Cain you will be missed.
What an absurd example of the audacious ignorance of Trump supporters. Ignorance in two profound senses. Literally "not knowing" basic American history, civics, and on and on. But also ignorance as acts of "ignoring." Ignoring basic civility, decency, and even reality.

HECK NO !!!  My Mom is still alive ( Thank God ) and still a Republican , she wrote in Kasich in 2016 , but is voting Biden this year. My Father hated Clinton with a livid passion- he would have hated Trump the same way, for the same reasons. Disrespect for the office and lies
This is a scary but possible scenario that Trump could employ to steal the election. Please read and contemplate - then act by voting for Biden.

He had survived a Stage 4 diagnosis from 2006. The current year is 2020. That is a delta of 14 years. Cancer and the treatment left him immunocompromised, which made him more susceptible to COVID-19. It was probably the COVID that got him, which may be from Trump Tulsa Rally.
Until trump issues an EO and uses the courts to stall.
I suggest you ask the American people what they want!  We don‚Äôt want to honor Confederates.  You and Trump‚Äôs position is racist and is on the wrong side of history.
Adult Temper Tantrum Syndrome. Whatever it takes to stay in office, right Dump? Dems, Reps, and others have successfully been voting by mail for YEARS.

Have you ever heard about Russian collusion? That story was a hoax. Covered endlessly.  CNN pretends Trump didn't immediately say "and I'm not talking about the neo Nazis and white nationalists, they should be condemned completely" after he said fine people. Lies.
What a load of shit. 1st, when you went to that rally you all agreed that you were willing to die for Donald Trump. 2nd sitting beside someone doesn't mean anything unless your identical twins. 6 months into this, we've learned alot &amp; the most important thing is to wear a mask.
You said Herman died from going to a Trump rally. I contested it and refrained from mentioning how disrespectful it was but now-I just did. Got a comic strip to finish. God Bless Herman Cain.

It's not that surprising when a man who is at risk for the virus, dies of the virus after POTUS encourages him &amp; others to attend a rally that will spread the virus. This isn't rocket science, stop defending the dummy that is this President. Stop being Trump's cult follower.
Herman Cain was a 74 year old cancer survivor. He attended a rally that every health official says shouldn't have happened, was a super spreader event. The rally only happened because Trump's ego, he literally died for Trump's fucking ego.

Good question! Also, who owns it now? Is it a Trump property?
When I saw the video of Cain and the black trump supporters at the rally looking so proud to be there, I thought how sad, and that some of them would most likely tbe the first to die. I wonder if trump even cares, being the racist that he is.
Only Congress can do that. tRump has no power to do it !!
Cain attended Trump's indoor¬†rally in Tulsa, sharing¬†photos of himself not wearing a mask. Several others who attended the rally subsequently became sick including the girlfriend of Donald Trump Jr. Six Trump campaign staffers also tested positive.
I suspected It might Victoria, but tRump/Pence would have to leave office if the election isn't held before 20 January, R's up for relection in the Senate would gone, the D's would be the majority, a Dem would be Pres until the election is held !!

Herman Cain died of COVID-19, let's remember right before he tested positive he tweeted some anti-mask messages and was at Trump's Tulsa rally, where he probably caught/spread the virus. This guy died for his dumb political opinions.

It wouldn't help him anyway. As long as enough states hold elections and those states comprise 270 electoral votes, Biden is sworn in. If not, then the Speaker of the House is sworn in.  There is no path for Trump remaining president no matter how much he tweets.

The  ‚Äúrule of law‚Äù and Donald Trump are not even in the same ballpark.    Safe?  150k dead millions infected and unemployed and the economy is shambles.    If this so your idea of safe, you can keep it.
don‚Äôt come down here talking about faith. You‚Äôre backing a fucking criminal every day you‚Äôre in office. Grow a pair of balls and do your goddam job.  Contrary to what you and trump believe, you both WORK FOR US.
Why I have no problem calling libs "Mask Nazis".  There is no proof Cain caught Corona at Trump rally.    If he got near any protestor at Trump rally...that protestor could have been carrier...many of them at BLM Protest with Al Sharpton night before

Trump supporters #MAGA2020 know what the President Trump is talking about. The Fraud that Democrats and Elites are planning to rig the Election. The Federalist haven't really been on the President Trump side. Something going on, as a average person we see through the BS. Vote Red
Federalist Society co-founder says Trump‚Äôs tweet about postponing the election is grounds for ‚Äòimmediate impeachment‚Äô
"It's not Donald tRump's right to bestow upon or take away the voting franchise. That franchise has been been paid with the blood of American martyrs &amp; it is our inheritance, all of ours."  right on point! (Scared my dogs by clapping loudly &amp; cheering at the tv!)
copper peed on a keep america great yard sign today. dogs against trump 2020
I wish you had this same energy when we found out trump knew about Russian Bounties on US soldiers and still haven‚Äôt did anything about it !!
trump: all schools need to open, kids will be fine. they won‚Äôt go to the hospital and they won‚Äôt die. they definitely won‚Äôt pass covid onto their family.   also trump: we should hold off on the election because it‚Äôs not safe and mail-in-ballots are fraud.
I could see Mitch getting more and more fed up with how bad Trump makes the Republican Party look. The constant conspiracy theories and false claims. Mitch is not blind nor an idiot.
Even the Reagan insitution doesn‚Äôt want anything to do with Trump.
Trump's been reading Plato again.
America is NOT even close to the oldest so your statement rings hollow immediately. And trump is doing his best to make sure we r not the best. The best means working with friends not praising dictators and enemies. Bringing the people together not driving a wedge between them
Yes at the hands of Donald J Trump
They're occupying cities against the will of the local leaders and black bagging innocent people trying to exercise their constitutional rights. This is what dictators do because Trump is a dictator.
Ne'er a more perfect headline other than the one I hope to see this winter: "Trump Loses Bigly! Biggest Landslide Ever!" #willingitso #VoteBidenDammit
So you cant find anything that Trump has said that is comparable? You dont need to waste your time. You won't.
Millions would have died if Trump hadn't acted in January while Democrats were calling it nothing to worry about. Think about that. MILLIONS would have died, but you don't thank YOUR PRESIDENT. Open your eyes &amp; see give credit where credit is due. Wow, the lies you guys believe!!
For the first time I am afraid for the United States.  I am seeing that this can go towards a very serious problem about the elections just like any third world country, due to the distrust that Trump is creating in the people with the vote by mail.
Actually Trump didnt start it. Clinton supporters, with or without her campaigns aide, started it.    The central park 5 ad was the sentiment of most new Yorkers at the time and was printed when the 5 teens were almost certainly deemed guilty by the public.
Trump's with it! He knows how to tweet even before he was elected. He knows how to read other tweets and share what matters most. He knows what science says, what doctors are saying, but you Biden, are led around by doctors and told what to say, and you still mess it up! #Worried
Yeah, bullshit. That‚Äôs the official Republican excuse every time Trump says something racist,  illegal or flat out stupid. He was ‚Äújoking.‚Äù Pathetic. üôÑ
Herman Cain ok, ok, Rest In Peace and all that but, how many more people will die like him because of Trump and his Campaign and the Republicans?   #COVIDIOT
Trump has definitely put a dent in our democracy...
Person, woman, man,camera, tv. Joe I can not wait until your able to put your cognitive abilities against Trump. Your debates against Palin and Ryan were a master class in performance.

Please show this to your relatives who keep saying Trump is a ‚Äúgreat business man‚Äù.
We should have done more to stop trump from being elected!
This wasn‚Äôt some kind of strategic trolling move. Trump is really, really ignorant. He‚Äôs made this abundantly clear over and over again.

Trump is my hero and what every worthy man aspires to be.
She doesn't care about him. His death was easily preventable. Wear a fucking mask and stop gathering at trump rallies. Period.
To watch the lemmings in the media follow it off the cliff  . . . hysterical. People think Trump's dumb,  and sometimes they are right, other times he's playing them like a fiddle.

To all these imbeciles that claim "President Trump has divided America"If Biden sleazes his way into the White House, they will see genuine division! They will see millions of pissed off  Patriots storm Washington and over throw the Globalist coup.  By force! Give me liberty!!!
President Trump met with the family of a soldier who investigators say was slain on the Texas Army base where she was stationed, saying it is a "terrible story" and that he would help with funeral expenses.
Not a socialist but I don‚Äôt like Trump. This is still America right?
Not a chance. Biden will win in a landslide and after that, the only unresolved issue will be where to send trump's last presidential check. By the way, these conspiracy theory, worst case scenario stories, serve no real purpose. Report real news and lay off the what if stories.
Yes.  I worry that Trump will use them to fix the election.
King Trump?
King Trump??
Twitter took down trump Jrs account for posting the doctors saying #Hydroxychloroquine works. Now the evil greedy bastards that control everything can‚Äôt get the vaccines üíâ out fast enough. Even with the truth out there you will always have stupid #Sheep in line to get tagged.
Trump has Bill Barr working in the background to make everything he wants to happen. Be concerned. Very concerned.
Majority means more people voted not for trump. We learned what majority meant in 6th grade. Stop deflecting from the misuse of majority in your stupid fucking slogans. The phrases are not even remotely correct. 3 million votes less than correct.
These lazy teachers who don't want to come to work can stay at home and collect their welfare check. I would like for President Trump to send us a check in the mail for $7000, and I will be glad to have my son homeschooled.
Lmao yeah that also, Cuomo has an unbelievable amount of blood on his hands from this BUT he was a great cable news mascot as the "anti-Trump" voice for Democrats (as he slashed hundreds of millions from healthcare spending &amp; threw De Blasio under the bus)
Nobody will ever judge character until character presents itself, which others is not willing to try.  You are guilty until proven innocent.  Just because you "appear" a certain way doesnt mean you are immediately branded a 'trump supporter'
When working, I can't imagine a similar environment like at a rally. Also, we all need to work. Nobody needs to go to a rally. Trump killed him and probably others by insisting on rally in the middle of pandemic. Fanatical Trumpism...
These guys don't look like cops.  Are they Trump's own Red Army?  Their uniforms, their behavior, it all looks like something from pre WWII Nazi shit. It's really happening, America-wake up!  VOTE.
Trump borrowing suppression tactics from Russia and other dictatorships from around the world ...
The crazy thing about this is that nobody utilized all those empty seats.   At the very least, you could have spaced yourselves out a bit.   Herman Cain beat stage 4 cancer, but decided to risk it all for a Trump rally. Sad way to go.   Cover your face. Quit crying about it.
Yet another Trumper who didn't care Trump was destroying America until the destruction knocked on their door. But welcome to the right side of history I suppose.
People are rightfully upset about all of this, but you can't dream of holding anyone in Trump's admin legally responsible for COVID19 deaths when Bush is hanging out with Ellen while New Orleans is still rotting &amp; Obama is the king of Netflix while Flint still has deadly water

WISHFUL THINKING TRUMP YOU ARE PACKING YOUR BAGS IN NOVEMBER!!!
you bemoan Trump using mail-in ballots as a device to change the subject from Covid or the GDP plunge but then all you do is talk about his mail-in bs. You're victims. cc
President Trump‚Äôs press briefing started after 5:30 today - obama had already spoken. His ‚Äúeulogy‚Äù had already been posted to YouTube by 3:30 today so he was no longer speaking when the President‚Äôs briefing started.
I can see this happening but it‚Äôs a bad idea because it would do the opposite. The next president has a responsibility to hold trump accountable.
I will say that one Trump flag went down in the neighborhood today.
But we‚Äôre supposed to believe that while Blue states are on lockdown, only 247 people could find the time to watch #BasementJoeBiden give a prepared speech. Hell, Trump can get 10x that total to watch him walk to Marine One. #JoeNoGo

Pres Trump expressed condolences for Herman Cain very first thing in his briefing today. No one knows how Cain contacted C-19; it hasn‚Äôt been linked to the one rally that‚Äôs been held. He was a 74-year old man who had battled stage-4 colon cancer &amp; was at risk like all those 60+.
It's pretty clear you don't think the rest of us read the part that said: ..."until people can properly, securely and safely vote." The delay was in the context of protecting voters (not that Trump actually cares about that).
Floyd was a criminal and drug addict. And his death had zero to do with race.  He didn‚Äôt deserve or earn to be a martyr it was all political and for people using Cains death against trump proves the ignorance and evil from the left.
He is as useless as Trump!#DumpTrumpDayNov3
Romney says he will propose extension of unemployment benefits during virtual town hall with NAACP president  of course he will anything to stop the economy so he can see trump loose he is a sore looser
So when doctors and science am say things, it‚Äôs lying?  "Hydroxychloroquine Works"  Says Dr. Gold.     Ignoring doctors and science? Then you‚Äôre on your own.   Trump 2020
Trump wants to push back the election but open schools. Stfu. This is signs of dictatorship. He‚Äôs trying to stay if loses or not. Trying to make it so we can‚Äôt vote him out. Get this fool out of here.
"Hydroxychloroquine Works"  Says Dr. Gold.     Ignoring doctors and science? Then you‚Äôre on your own.   Trump 2020
I'm starting to think that Trump's "base" isn't ethnic or religious.  It's people who have screwed up bigly in their lives, and then blame others.  In other words, Trump has monopolized the jackwagon vote.  #TrumpIsTheWORSTPresidentEVER #RememberInNovember
Doctor touted by Trump believes alien DNA is in medicine and demon dream sex is an actual problem
The Democrats said that Bush Jr. would try to delay the election. I was skeptical.  The Republicans said that Obama would try to delay the election. I was skeptical.  They said Trump would try to delay the election. I was skeptical. Then he said it himself. I was wrong.
, I am sure Trump was referring to Barr, Flynn,Manafort, Mike Pompeo, Giuliani, and Moscow Mitch when he referred to the Beehive, after all, these shady characters make lots of noises and even butt calls about their crimes
Trump admin squeezing the juice so they fail &amp; become private smh
Trump clearly is racist but racism, for him, is just an extension, of a sick mind looking for escape by blaming others w a sense of false superiority. But, i too, have special hard feelings abt black Republican's &amp; i think there is an element of racism i need 2 cleanse.
I'm terrified of Trump.  Do not rest. We have not yet defeated him.
He‚Äôs as crazy as tRump.
Lmao you must have been living under a rock this year. Trump did more harm to America this year alone than all 8 of Obama's years. The 150,000+ deaths are on Trump's hands. They're stained with the blood of Americans.

Right on...  I'm hoping we're all going to pull together and vote the racist Trump out.

As the wall goes up, illegal Crossings go down and so does the fvcking wall  This is proof that anything that Donald J Trump touches is destroyed
Evening brother &amp; sister #Resisters, what a hell of a day. The racist Trump is losing his mind. But what else is new. btw, if he slows down the mail, you can actually take your ballot to the supervisor of elections in your county.  Don't allow this fool to take away your vote.
What if a foreign government came to monitor the elections so Trump can‚Äôt cheat.
Might want to look at the environment around you. Where people are being forced to wear ankle monitors just because they MIGHT be sick. That's not Trump doing that. But, then again, Obama was the only logical person on the Left.
You know better. Trump never has a plan. Sometimes he comes close but those times it‚Äôs merely a scheme.
donald trump U have been promising to reduce drug prices &amp; you have failed horribly. 4 years in office &amp; you haven‚Äôt dotted an ‚ÄúI‚Äù on anything to reduce the price of drugs.  Your losing this election &amp; now you want to do something? I don‚Äôt think so!  YOU ARE A LOSER DONALD TRUMP

I live in Florida and am an advocate for Early Voting. For this election, I want the election day numbers to be a landslide for Biden, so we don't have Trump contesting and waiting on counting mail in ballots.

Great!  But, ‚Å¶ - This doesn‚Äôt even come close to redeeming yourself from your utter #Covid fiasco. And I pledge to do everything I can to see you NEVER hold public office again in my State.
Bye bye #MoscowMitch ! It‚Äôs YOU holding th is up trying to sneak in prettying up the FBI building in the interest of making the Trump property more valuable and to rid them competition.
Trump has a press conference spouting nonsense about other countries' covid problems. The media then takes the bait and argues about that instead of telling us the facts about the US. Wise up. Remember 2016. Shiny objects. Get it.
plsss being the only educated one in a white trump supporter household ain‚Äôt it
Yea too bad Trump threw a rally with no health guidelines against medical professional advice during a pandemic and killed him.
Trump said that Herman Cain passed away from a thing called the China virus.  He meant to say the Trump virus.
DeSantis has already shown that he doesn‚Äôt care. Like his hero tRump.
The Trump administration wants $377 million in the next coronavirus relief bill to remodel the West Wing of the White House.

Wow.  Trump just called the election "rigged", "fixed", and "crooked" three months before it starts.  The president is on national TV right now attacking our democracy.  This is unbelievable, even by Trump standards.

Trump, you read totally from your script that was given to you!!! You should have looked into the camera and spoke from the ‚ù§. You cant do that coz you have no ‚ù§. Your words fall on deaf hears and means nothing!!! TRUMP YOUR LOSING!!! 32 % GDP CONTRACTION TODAY!!!
Wow.  Trump blowing the crap out of the Hatch Act from the press room as he undermines confidence in our November elections, and tries to draw a distinction between vote-by-mail and absentee ballots (they're the same thing).  Absolutely insane.  Impeach him again.
I‚Äôm fine with delaying the election. Trump is out on Jan 20th without an election and then i don‚Äôt have to vote for Biden either.
Trump will NEVER have that.
Trump is a liar and a cheat
Trump to tell him to do it.

When you watch and listen to President Obama, it is so hard to understand how evangelicals or other religious people can support Trump. It is also very easy to see why Trump is so jealous of Barack Obama. Trump is such a tiny, tiny man.

The people of Florida can beg a they want to  however lets not forget that he his Trump's puppet and doesn't care who lives or who dies. All he cares about is what Trump tell's him to do. He is a weak governor and shouldn't be reelected next go around period.
what would be more fun? just quickly picking up trump then throwing him out onto pennsylvania ave, or a slow and agonizing drag from the wh residence, onto the ellipse, out the gates? "no, no, very unfair, polls were rigged!" the whole way

Weekend before the election, Trump/Barr "find"evidence of mass election interference, tell supporters do not vote on Tuesday because they "can't secure it in time". Instant cluster f*** that can put the result of the election in doubt no matter the margin
What?  How does Trump pass that test?  Just today, he floated a trial balloon about abusing power he doesn't have to delay an election.  Dems, otoh, are running their campaign on the premise of reigning in power (although it remains to be seen if they live up to that).
I hope you are right.  But evangelicals love tRump, they worship tupPence.  The GOP sheep will fall in line behind him

Throughout this, I've often thought that if I were an epidemiologist or virologist, I'd say "screw, y'all!" and move to a country where I don't receive death threats or accusations of being a Marxist who wants to destroy America whenever I share research that contradicts Trump.
are other judges potentially recusing themselves from the Flynn case? Can Trump block AG Barr from testifying ?
Politico Editor Fantasizes About Trump Quitting the Race
And  said it is up to the DOJ. It's not. Don't let that little nugget get lost in the truckload of *trump bullshit we have to wade through day in and day out.
Trump's claims that the military is prepared to distribute COVID-19 vaccine are 100% lies
Why White Evangelicals Worship at the Altar of Donald Trump w/ Sarah Pos...  via
Is this like when Trump said he‚Äôd have a big scoop on Bill &amp; Hillary the following Tuesday or when he said Melania will have a news conference about her resume‚Äô, still waiting for both.
More propaganda. Have you ever considered you are being played by a powerful establishment that hates trump for not falling in line with their goals and hates you for simply existing?
Trump killed Herman Cain.
Wonder how Trudeau backers feeling as it came out their Liberal Wunderkind has been using US Republican (Trump's Party) Marco Rubio's campaign staff in some of his shennanigans üòÅ
Trump will and does try to force China to play equally. Biden will sell out.
I honestly don't think trump has a chance of winning.  It's the 23 republican senators up for re-election that do.  And the two vulnerable democrats (Doug Jones of Alabama and Gary Peters of Michigan) need to be protected.
You sure got a point, Brother Bakari, but, then again, it was "Us" against the Electoral College, Trump, and Putin. We were outnumbered.
All the above. Ha. Trump said if you wear a mask you don‚Äôt support him or something like that. So no masks.
Luv2 watch people rehabilitate trump in real time lol
Good... I was worried you wouldn't find some way to make this about Trump
And I don‚Äôt fucking care. His politics have hurt hundreds of thousands of people. I hope he rots in hell like every other person on the Trump cabinet.
You have missed the point. He was blasting Trump during a funeral service. Btw I support Trump. I have a MBA, and am not stupid. Like most crass liberals. You are quick to say diversity and inclusion but quick to criticize  those who you disagree with. Hypocrite.
Are Trump and  are holding up stimulus cause he wants an  building near his  property... So he can get CONTRACTS to house agents, visitors etc after he gets out of office. But that's not #Corruption ? #Congress
Everyone loves Fauci right?  If I remember correctly Trump hired him no?
üôÑ Trump country? What, Mar A Lago?
When  crushes  on November 3rd and Trump‚Äôs team starts floating the idea of a pardon, I hope Biden laughs in their faces.  Also, I wonder if  has started making plans for dying in prison of old age.
This man Trump really trying to flake on the election.
Herman Cain just as likely caught CoronaVirus from BLM Antifa Protest hosted by Al Sharpton, held nite before Trump Rally  Event had staff work BOTH events, &amp; were most likely to get close to Cain during entering rally venue.  Trump Rally moved up 1 day due to BLM #RIPHermanCain
People are already blaming Trump for his death. Smh
These people desperately want to believe Trump isn‚Äôt just making up stuff on the spot and just spouting whatever sounds good at the time. They are willing to suspend disbelief to extremes to pretend he‚Äôs carefully mapped all this out like The Da Vinci Code.   It‚Äôs sad.
üôÑ When did Trump become a nazi exactly? I seem to remember him being much beloved by the democrats and many many black people like Sharpton and Jackson right up till he beat the incredibly corrupt Clinton machine. Trump is a chad who dated women of every type and has a jew son.
Instead of Tweeting about Trump, why can't  help us get answers from Mayor Dyer and the City of Orlando? All we want is help. All we want is help. We don't need your attacks.
Res ipsa loquitur and what a deadly message indeed. trump should be court ordered to visit every grave beyond the 15 or so he predicted back in January when he called Covid a hoax.
To all liberals. When Mr. Bone Spur delays election &amp; shuts down the media. Make sure you have all your preps in place ham radio, water, food, pistol, shotgun, rifle, at least 4- 80 lb. dogs and be prepared for revolution. As I, understand the Joint Chiefs will not follow Trump.
I trust President Trump, I don‚Äôt trust Dr Fauci or Bill Gates. HCQ + Zpac + Zinc is the answer to Covid19. Why did they conspire to allow the deaths of 150,000 Americans and counting ? Why do they continue to conspire to kill Americans ? For money üí∞ ? For partisan politics ? üôèüèΩ
*trump and class are two words that should never ever ever be used in the same sentence.
#HermanCain- Don't know much abt him, but condolences to his family. All those who appease Donald Trump's ego abt #mask and #Hydroxychloroquine, pay attention to scientific facts if you want to live.  &amp; others crowding around your 'TrumpGod' Put your family first.
He boycotted 45 inauguration based on Hillary lies and called Trump illegitimate
Why? He went to a Donald Trump rally where masks weren‚Äôt enforced and died as a result of it. This is 100% your boy Donald‚Äôs fault. Cry about it.
Looks like we are not going to become a lawless nation after all. I think at this point, just about everyone has had enough of trump's and barr's attempts at circumventing the law. I have always believed that there are still good, decent people, who aren't part of trump nation.
Shame on you Trump for no acknowledgement of #JohnLewisMemorial not even a letter #TrumpIsAMoron #RIPJohnLewis #CivilRightsICON
- we dare Trump to do it!
Are you talking about me and me family? Because we voted for Hillary in 2016, we are Latinos. And we are going to vote for Trump first time
Trump made this guy look like a good president üò™
It is patently obvious Trump doesn‚Äôt have the Constitutional authority to delay or cancel the election, but it is the latest evidence of his dictatorial tendencies
Good luck with that, Kamala.  Count me as one who didn‚Äôt vote in 2016 who will vote Trump in 2020, and Republican straight down the ballot.  My 3 kids also didn‚Äôt vote in 2016, and are all with MAGA.  In Florida.
Democrats passed a bill in the house... you‚Äôre just as bad at lying as Trump is.
Trump-Desantis Virus = 32.9 percent annualized contraction in gross domestic product and 1.43 million new jobless claims,.
I caught some at lunch and try explaining to people who think Trump is good why you are crying, it goes right over their head!
So...doesn't seem to have helped much. We have 4% of the world population and 25% of the deaths. Doesn't look like anything Trump did helped. He's still not helping. Let's not forget he's hyping treatments the FDA did not approve. Ignored wearing a mask for months. SAD!!!
The sad thing is trump voted by Mail in 2004, and his press secretary voted by mail 12 times.
Trump is such a baby.
I‚Äôm not wasting my time arguing about the fact that the leadership of this country is Trump period. Any leadership with competence and not more concerned about himself could have have done better. If you love him you can have him but he is responsible for this catastrophe
We know. That‚Äôs how bad trump is. We look back and go ‚Äúthat was waaaay better‚Äù.
It was so good. It‚Äôs so refreshing to hear someone actually speak intelligently and compassionately about something that matters.   He pushed for voting while Trump is trying to delay the election.
Donald Trump is a Trojan fighting on a horse defending us from Russia. Pass it on!
#ObamaWasBetterAtEverything my President spoke Trump you cannot delay the election remember this is America not Rusia or North Korea , definitely you are not a king just a dirty disgusting looser
When this goddam  nightmare is finally over and gone, we are going to find out Trump‚Äôs  &amp; most Republican Governor‚Äôs pathetic response to #Covid was a purposeful attempt to keep voters from the polls. They were &amp; are WILLING TO LET AMERICANS DIE!
Mr Trump, I'm behind you a 100%. Some people aren't sure yet. Now would be a good time for a FIRESIDE CHAT, with the people...non-political, non-judgmental...JUST ASSURING US, from YOU, as OUR PRESIDENT &amp; FRIEND.
Trump does stuff every day that he ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù do.    The law is meaningless when nobody enforces it.
Trump is probably so jealous of the John Lewis funeral that he'll do a presser from a coffin at 5...
Trump Derangement Syndrome may kill you faster than Covid 19, you may want to take a chill pill!

For anyone who says No, move to another country. Because the only reason for not liking Trump is because he loves this country, its history and the patriotic citizens.
Trump Blows Up the Left with Election Delay Tweet
So predictable trump. I saw a video recently of republicans you fired from the white house that said you already had a delay plan to remain in office longer. Trying to be like your idol putin. You are not putin and never will be. You both are pieces of $h!t though.
That is a good way to buy every citizen vote. Don‚Äôt get fool by #trump #votetrumpout
China is not responsible for the US. The President of the United States is responsible for the response he has taken and continue to take. Oh I forget Putin is running the US so I understand how so many Americans have died and will continue to die with Trump as president.
Trump on Twitter is like an atheist in a Sunday School class.
With  ‚ÄúDelay the election‚Äù tweet, is there anyone else but me beginning to think Trump could possibly not win a single Electoral College vote and  will win all 50 States &amp; 1/2 dozen territories!  Fewer people each minute wil not be #DyingForTrump.
President Trump suggested that the next round of stimulus checks could be "way higher" than $1,200: "I'd like to see it be very high," Trump said. "I want the people to get it."
Dude.. my niece is much more qualified than trump... she's only 4 n doesn't need a cognitive test..
How so did trump ? Or trump just didn‚Äôt mess up what obama was doing ?
"especially me" Everything that Trump says has to be about Trump. He is one sick puppy.
Trump has no control over the Capitol Building, Congress does.  So Trump did not order the flag to half mast.  Probably a voice vote of both houses resulted in the flag being lowered.
Its insulting to imply that Trump is mentally ill, are you or anyone on this thread a doctor? No. So stop diagnosing others.
Remember when Biden said Trump was going to try and delay the election and MAGAs were like ‚ÄúLOL NO WAY. JOE HAS DEMENTIA LOL‚Äù, but now Trump is saying he wants to delay the election &amp; MAGAs are like ‚Äúwe should delay the election‚Äù.  Remember that. Remember that when it happened.
Trump doesn't want to delay the election, he wants to cover this up
I'm sure Trump wishes he could have watched. He's a sadist to the core.
96 days until Trump loses and contemplates how much jail time he‚Äôll get. #SDNY
My Apple device autocorrect  has finally got smart and realized I don't ever want to capitalize the word trump.
Ok, did I just hear this right? Herman Caine died from COVID-19. It just keeps getting worse for Trump.  Did he not get the memo about hydroxychloroquine (you get it).  Damn, I Guess not, sorry not sorry he‚Äôs was an enabler for the baby in chief!
The sad part is they had him sign a liability waiver. He had to know at that point what he was getting into or maybe not,  maybe just being the sacrificial lamb for trump?
You‚Äôve got her confused with Trump and Putin
A society that allows military occupations is not a safe society for anyone. I should know, I've visited some of those countries, it's fucking bad, Cuba does this, former Soviet countries do this, this is what dictators do. And Trump will lose in November.
Unlikely.  Dems at least try to justify their power grabs as being good for America.  Trump, otoh, nakedly does it to benefit himself.
I just did the same. tRump‚Äôs tweets about mail-in voting are a poster-child example of the type of Tweets that should be reported with Twitter‚Äôs ‚Äúattempts at voter suppression‚Äù category.
On running America like a business: In business, if you act like an idiot, you lose money. In government, if you act like an idiot, 100,000+ people die, and 30+ million lose their jobs.  But you can try to blame Obama for it. #TrumpPandemic #Trumpocalypse
Not my lesbian cousin posting pictures of her at what looks like a trump rally, with no mask and waving a blue lives matter flag ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è
Trump didn't just break the GOP, he broke conservatism
Christian and a Trump supporter? Can‚Äôt be both. Choose one.
1) The media buried Biden after NH. No one was crowing that ‚Äúhe was the only one who could beat Trump‚Äù 2) All other candidates endorsed him? Lmao. Do remember that coming into Super Tuesday, there were two major moderate candidates  (Bloomberg &amp; Biden) and two progressive ones...
Dear media: the next time Trump doesn't shit himself giving a speech and you feel the need to say he appears "presidential," watch this clip to remember what "presidential" really means. Looking at you #vanjones
The media seems to like Trump‚Äôs new tone.... they‚Äôre still talking about it. ü§Æ
wants us to celebrate his birthday! But im here to expose him as a Trump supporting Republican who slaps babies and refuses to wear a mask while in Target.
The economy tanked today in case you didn't notice, thanks to Trump and the Republican Senate who enables him.
Trump also has Erik Prince and his private army goons on his side
this man got really mad because he was wearing a Trump 2020 mask and someone said something to him about it. He said, ‚ÄúI just knew someone would say something!‚Äù  ...then why did you wear it, sir?  Ah yes, because you actually want to get reactions out of people, drama whore.
Yeah I know that one, but I think there's still a lot of grey area. And any politician using it will probably face some nasty backlash as sending the military into cities to occupy is widely hated by the very cities and states they're occupying. Trump will lose this election.
They are concerned. Trump Campaign knew the risk because they made the people sign a waiver.   FoxNews, Lou Dobbs, Sean Hannity, Trump Campaign, Trump himself promoted the #TulsaRally despite the multiple calls to cancel.   I wonder what Herman Cain thought the los days
My entire state votes by mail. Sorry, Mr. President. It works great.
Trump counts on the ‚Äúfear his supporters in the White Supremacy, Militia and Far-Right movements will incite chaos and rebellion if Trump contests the results of the November election
Weekend before the election, Trump/Barr "find"evidence of mass election interference, tell supporters do not vote on Tuesday because they "can't secure it in time". Instant cluster f*** that can but the result of the election in doubt no matter the result
McConnell and other top Republican officials rebuff Trump suggestion to delay the Nov. 3 election

McConnell and other top Republican officials rebuff Trump suggestion to delay the Nov. 3 election - The Washington Post
From the head of the Federal Electoral Commission. Go to hell, Trump. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
Love the Lincoln Project!!!!! Love the real truth they put out. Paying off leans on their homes is what trump, McConnell and Rs did for crooked Brett Kavanaugh!!
President Trump has not been saying much new lately. Good for the coverage staying with three real presidents of the United States!
... comment ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù has to make...
When trump dies, will anyone outside of his klan show? Why would Clinton or Obama go? Why would Pelosi go? Only 1 reason and one reason only, make sure his body is really there
Trump killed Epstein and Cain
Give it a few hours &amp; Trump will shit all over the entire event... &amp; the media will allow it by covering whatever vulgar, hateful, racist comment has to make about it. Enables.
I‚Äôm going to the booth and vote.  Trump is a snake.
It's kind of ironic that someone so slow witted is paid to be in charge of rapid response for Trump.
At least he got to see Trump drink water successfully
Is that a eulogy or a campaign speech for the Democrats. This people are incredible, they are the first one to criticize Trump about anything and everything!
Holding a ‚Äòcops for trump‚Äô sign doesn‚Äôt do much to disprove the notion that they‚Äôre all racists.
So trump hasn‚Äôt said a word about Herman Cain? It‚Äôs almost like he‚Äôs a black man...
UPDATE! More Than $1,200 Stimulus Check (Call by President Trump)  via
Also trump: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt vote because it will be a fraudulent one‚Äù üòÇ
Right but my point being if it eliminates Trump for now we can work on the rest later. Choices are so limited
Boy has the green eyed Monster EVER got a hold on Trump! He is completely blind with jealousy of Obama.
How does one take over a free society?   You start by questioning the motives on how we elect our officials. Trump is purposefully planting the seeds of doubt in his followers minds and the minds of undecided voters. This is straight up fraud.
Listening to BHO's eulogy for John Lewis right now. Wonder what Trump has up his sleeve now.
Exactly what I tough #trump diverting te news same time #Obama is giving his eulogies to #JohnLewisMemorial
Trump is nothing more than a game show host promoting his sponsors!
I am proud that under President Trump, historic measures have been taken to support women in the U.S. and abroad. Take a look! Thank you  and  for these unprecedented feats for millions
Just because 1/3 of the country is enthusiastic doesn‚Äôt mean trump will win, pretty simple to understand lol
Translation, we are just as ready to be rid of trump as the rest of the world.
Donald J Trump
Fuck Trump and Biden #Netflix got the black vote bih ‚úäüèæ
NHL is the most pro Trump league, 80% of players are Trump supporters (especially the Russian players), they picked Kid Rock, noted Trump supporter, to sing at All-Star Game a couple years ago
He followed his cult leader... and died for Trump.
This sick man is Trump Made #MAGA  #TrumpThreatensAmerica
#trump wants to delay the election...please god i hope nobody tells him THAT if the election is delayed past january 20th  #NancyPelosi will become President!!!
...yet, when Trump tried to pull it off with  in 2016, the media called out Trump on it within 48 hours.  Are you also into this hypocritical double-standard, like  and others? ü§î
Or if Trump had been an adult and worn a mask in public for the last four months.
Donald J Trump, the Trump Campaign, FoxNews, Hannity, Lou Dobbs are all co-responsibles for the death of Herman Cain.   The #TulsaRally was an aberration, thousands told you not to do it. I wonder how many more people are sick?
tRump says what do you have to lose?   I say we lose everything if tRump wins again.
Didn‚Äôt Trump just now call the press pool in to take away from Obama speaking? And like always.... the media races to kiss Trump‚Äôs fat ass!
And Trump is every bit as good a President as those men were, which is why this suggestion is so unexpected
The mainstream media has been giving Trump a pass and the benefit of doubt for decades, most notoriously by allowing him to push birtherism for an entire year knowing his claim was bogus and racist.
And Trump is every bit as good a President as those men were, which is why this suggestion is just so unexpected
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
I‚Äôm appalled you know Trump doesn‚Äôt have Constitutional authority to delay or change the election date and still the headline question leading to your report  was ‚ÄúCould he really do it?‚Äù.  Unbelievable!
Twitter is accused of double standards for flagging posts by Trump
Michigan Threatens to Slip From Trump as He Goes Quiet on Airwaves  via   ,  ,  , , , , Your Going To Losse Big In November!
That‚Äôs fine. Delay the election. Trump is out of office on Jan 20th at noon anyways if he isn‚Äôt re-elected. No election just means no trump or Biden. Win-win for me.
I pretty sure #trump is planning to diverse the media against #obama coming speech in #JohnLewisMemorial
All while kissing Trump‚Äôs ass.
Every moment you spend tweeting is a moment you're not phonebanking for biden.   Hop to it, or it's your fault trump wins.
I‚Äôm sure his family is so proud of him for dying in the name of Trump. It‚Äôs a cult.
Aaaaaaand there it is, folks. He is threatening our democracy. If Trump could have his way, we would never be allowed to vote again.  Get registered. Vote.
Take that Trump! #RuleOfLaw
Thare is just one case per state every six or seven years, on average of Mail-In voter fraud. We are talking about an occurrence that translates to about 0.00006 percent of total votes cast. Trump's just terrified because you can't cheat if there's a #PaperTrail
Voted for Obama twice, didn‚Äôt realize I was so sleepy.... In 2016 I could not bare to see corrupt Hillary continue the lies and BS. I voted for Trump in ‚Äò16 and just recently changed my votes ID to red. I am never looking back. #NoCensorship #MAGA2020
President Trump floats delay of #2020election, citing widespread mail-in voter fraud despite any evidence.
Then how about you give something that can put food on our tables! Cut the military BS, the gifts to trump, the liability protections for big businesses and anything else that doesn‚Äôt directly assist citizens! It‚Äôs not difficult!! #PassTheHEROESAct
Lmfao he didn‚Äôt say he will delay the election. He just suggested itüòíüòíüòí   President Trump suggests delay to November election, though experts say he lacks the authority to do so
He chose not to wear a mask. Trump did not force him
May Trump be next ...
If you feel like there‚Äôs nothing you can do to help get trump out of office, fear not, you can be instrumental in denying him another term üëáüèº
I think that we can all agree that Donald Trump should be locked up.  But where? #TrumpIsUnwell #LockHimUp #TrumpCrimeFamily
I saw President Trump's Election tweet, I noticed the last sentence ended with question marks, the left is going crazy over a question.  With mostly mail-in ballots it will take weeks to count them all thus delaying the election.  How many ballots will come in late?

No sympathy for idiots who are willing to die for Trump.
trump......he thinks he can. But he‚Äôs wrong!
They are literally dying for Trump. Idiots. I hope their families think it‚Äôs worth it.
So let me get this straight. trump wants to delay the elections... because he‚Äôs acknowledging that we‚Äôll still be dealing with corona in November? But also saying that it‚Äôs going to go away and wants to pull funding for unemployment because ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt want to go back to work‚Äù TF?

"I've known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy,'' Trump told New York Magazine in a profile of Epstein written three years before Epstein began to be investigated. "He's a lot of fun to be with. He likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.‚Äù

Trump floats delaying the November election. He does not have that authority. - NPR
Doesn't Trump realize that if the election is delayed, more Trump #COVIDIOTS will attend his rallies, speak in tongues in the emergency room, and then die?  Or does he think that you can mail in absentee ballots from Hell?  #ElectionDelay #TrumpIsDesperate
Just realized that Trump, Bush, and Clinton were all born during summer of 1946. Which other presidents have been closest in age?
Brilliant move by Trump though. We know mail in voting will have issues, if Trump wins, and Dems cry foul, he says I told you so. If he loses, it will be a stain on Biden's election as we continue to find uncounted ballots through 2022.
I believe that we are all a part of something profoundly good.....Well, except trump and his enablers.
Re-upping: There is no 'absentee,' only mail-ins, in FL, Trump voted by mail in Palm Beach, and several county supervisors (including Republican Chris Anderson in Seminole) are sending mail-in applications to every voter, the same process Trump attacks
we‚Äôre all better off giving trump one less platform for him to spread his lies!! also one less time we‚Äôd have to listen to him ‚Äúspeak‚Äù
Trump is NOT leaving. 4 more years.
trust me people i can guarantee you John Lewis did not want trump at his funeral, or to visit him while he lied in state. there‚Äôs no doubt in my mind he wanted him as far away from everything concerning him as possible. trump would‚Äôve turned this moment into a campaign speech!!
Will you hold Trump accountable for killing your friend, or ignore it along with the 150,000 other dead Americans?
Trump suggests delaying November election  As usual, the press, this time the BLACK press has lived p to its reputation as FAKE NEWS, and they only do it because they know their constituents are too intellectually lazy to check the facts for themselves
Correct unsubstantiated leak of virus.  I suggest purposely releases to influence our election. Which would put Dems in the middle of it as they have repeatedly said they would do ANYTHING to get rid of Trump
Yea.   Had a conversation yesterday with an ex-coworker on the phone.   Knew he was a Trump supporter but kind of dismayed to see he is a full covid denier.   Plus he has a pretty-existing condition
I agree Trump and Clinton are terrible people
Trump is desperate.   is right:  the 100 or so newspapers demanding that Bill Clinton resign in 1998 have more than enough reasons to demand Trump resign immediately
or, when trump tweets that someone should be investigated, and the next day Barr opens an investigation, that is a fact.
Stop bitching about Trump..yall keep playing his game by giving him your attention...at this point we all know what the deal is gotta take care of that shit in November...it would be great if the energy could be shifted #Racism #ChildTrafficking  #Immigration

They were at least, as a whole, willing to publicly say "this obviously bad thing is bad" before Trump. Now, they just shrug &amp; go "~~well, who's to say what 'good' or 'bad' means~~". Plus, we're going to have Q fuckos in Congress next. That's gonna be some shit.

Trump finally said something today that I agree with. He said the virus should have been stopped. Absolutely right. It should have been but you were too busy calling it a hoax and saying it would magically go away. Trump is to blame. He had a chance to control it and failed
Did you learn that deflection thingie from Trump? Coz we all know the only election fraud in recent years was done by Republicans.

He‚Äôs been by Trump‚Äôs side several times pandering on camera. What he‚Äôs saying isn‚Äôt surprising at all. Gross...but not surprising.
Abbott is corrupt.  Trump gathered up Rick Perry to keep an eye on him. All puppets for the oil complex.
5-6 years ago if you told me Trump would win presidency &amp; say/tweet all the things he's said/done...I would've never believed any of it. Not to mention, I would never think he'd get away with any of it...but here is 2020 for ya

President Trump, who is still expected to land in Tampa on Friday night for a fundraiser, had planned to travel to South Florida for a Saturday event at his Trump National Doral Miami golf resort.

I‚Äôll tell what I think is going on...The Federalists and The Council for National Policy already have a plan to rig the election and they don‚Äôt want Trump to blow their cover or to inadvertently discredit their rigged election.   The fix is (already) in...

Trump‚Äôs America is starting to look like a war zone against American citizens.  Remember what happened to the Romanian President.   Today in Los Angeles the Federal Secret Police.
"unforeseen" does not mean what Marco thinks it does. President Obama prepared US for a potential pandemic because he was ProLife and loves America.  Trump gutted his pandemic prep bc Putin installed him to kill Americans, &amp; make US weaker &amp; poorer. Congrats to ProDeath Marco.
What this really is - is white supremacy learning to disguise itself within universally passionate issues throughout society (issues that are usually riddled with popular conspiracy theories) - These people don‚Äôt care about child sex trafficking (ob-v with the Trump gear)
These people had Blue Lives Matter &amp; Trump gear - 95% of them didn‚Äôt have a mask, &amp; also many Anti-Vaxx signs among them. 100% of them White. No black or brown families or children within sight.

Jesus, that monster's up there creating election doubt!  And he's so stupid, he's actually doing us a favor, laying bare the dastardly plan that I'd wager Barr has a big hand in.  Mail-in &amp; absentee ballots are THE SAME THING.  Heed the flashing ORANGE LIGHTS, Democrats. #Trump
Maybe just maybe hear me out solomani was in bed with Hillary and Obama so they fed trump administration false info to kill him tying up loose ends ü§î of course we don't have the proof but very interesting
Neither Trump nor Barr can change the date of the election!!!!
If the him u are referring to is tRump then HELLLL NAWWW!!!!
#Trump: "This could have been stopped in China, but they didn't."  Does he understand how viruses work? Does he understand that viruses don't carry maps &amp; GPS-enabled devices &amp; don't give a rat's ass about borders &amp; walls?  Hell, does this dolt understand ANYTHING? #trumppresser
We can‚Äôt just beat Trump in Nov.there must be a total rebuke of the GOP.We cannot have divided government,with Mitch grifting still from the Senate helm,and fix this #TrumpDictatorship and all the damage that has been dealt.These  children need to clear out for the adults

I don't think the school stuff has anything to do with anything but this: Kids have been home for the summer. If they have to stay home longer, child care must be accounted for. Even under the best scenarios, parents will want to hand Trump his ass in this election. Kids4votes.
Welcome to the resistance, Steven Calabresi.
Hand turning in ballots needs to be yelled from the roof tops, especially with a trump sycophant heading the post office

Stop letting trump play you reporters, ask him relevant questions, don't allow him to evade questions, if you can't take the heat, close the kitchen
Convalescent plasma is going to get fast track FDA approval. Trump also just spoke about this. Look at what $KODK just did on his mention. Then think about what kinda moves we‚Äôll get on unique fast tracked treatment. These are 2 of the plasma tickers.
Trump 2020.
Unlike Trump who believes he IS America!
Trump‚Äôs eulogy of John Lewis would have gone something like this: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know John. I get my picture taken with many people. I am told by my advisors he was a great man. A Black man to my understanding. Is that right? So now he‚Äôs gone and we‚Äôll just have to see what happens.‚Äù

PLEASE HOLD YOUR GROUND AND DON'T SHUT DOWN FLORIDA AGAIN GOVERNOR DESANTIS AND ALLOW THE LEFT TO DESTROY THE ECONOMY ANY FURTHER, SO THAT THEY CAN THEN BLAME IT ALL ON YOU AND TRUMP AND THE WHOLE REGIME COME ELECTION TIME!!
Yes but listen to Trump talk as well...he hasn't a clue what he's talking about he's so uninformed and chooses to be that way. He slurs and stumbles reading. And come on he just straight makes shit up.
Which is why all this panic about President Trump refusing to leave office is unfounded.
That video explains why Trump need dog whistles #hatersgonnahate #FailureInChief

So is Leo, atleast he voting for Trump
#trumpvirus. Trump is dumb enough to trust China &amp; ignore US Intel...yet Singapore, S Korea, Vietnam etc were all smart enough not to trust China. Trump must be held accountable
I call your offices' only to be hung up on or told to leave a message.  You do a great job reporting the news but nothing to protect your constituents. Also, why don't you give us your opinion on Trump's delaying the election. We need this information. Man-up!
Hell yeah! Make Trump pardon Flynn and then make him testify before Congress without the benefit of 5th Amendment protection.   Hold Flynn in contempt if he refuses to testify.   Flynn didn‚Äôt just lie to the  that‚Äôs simply ONE OF THE CHARGES he was allowed to plea to.

Kellyanne,  Trump or daughter? I hear her, do you? You made your daughter be special....feel her listen to her  is in pain...respect her!  Headings of your accomplishments...you forgot WIFE TO A WONDERFUL HUSBAND MOTHER TO FOUR BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN!
As long as Trump loses before Jan 20th, when Biden takes the oath of office, it doesn‚Äôt matter when the election is held.  The shorter that ‚Äúlame duck‚Äù Trump is in power, the better.
So one u r a joke, two this is the same old crap &amp; three no one cares today we r feeling good having heard 3 past presidents speak giving needed nourishment to our souls. Trump &amp; his enablers look really ugly right now I would give it a rest if I were u
I am glad that Mr. Cain doesn't know that trump just tweeted out his new favorite pizza.
America was great with people like John Lewis and now we have a person in the wh who tearing America down.  Dump trump in 2020!
I have always voted by mail and will continue to do so. Trump is an idiot.

Glass houses, Steve?
Ricky is always full of BS. He‚Äôs a fake.
Why pick on the NBA and ignore Trump who encouraged Xi to put Uighur‚Äôsin camps so he could make a trade deal? Why pretend Rick didn‚Äôt send out High Speed train contract to China for personal $$ gain? Ron Johnson? McConnell-Chao?  Sure....blame athletes. That‚Äôs low hanging fruit
Important note: "Trump‚Äôs tweet came on the same morning the country reported an economic contraction of 9.5 percent in the second quarter of 2020, an unprecedented recession."
If we average the economic year of 2015, it‚Äôs is equal to 2019. In addition, Trump‚Äôs peak never exceeded Obama‚Äôs peak.
"The president‚Äôs suggestion is essentially impossible both logistically and legally. Some states begin voting in just a few short weeks, and only Congress has the power to change the election‚Äôs date."  Read
See how smart Trump is?  A few liberals floated extending the time to vote and some more pushed for vote by mail (though it's too late to print and mail new materials now).  So he's now got them saying we demand the election be held on time!  LMAO
If you look at David Jolly's voting record, he's as misogynist as Marco Rubio and he NEVER missed a chance to vote against healthcare access for working Americans. I'm not impressed Jolly says mean things about Trump because he shares so many of Trump/Rubio's Republican values.
I am going to sign for my 62 million friends that support Trump proudly.
You lie. America does not love Dr Fauchi. Some folks like him but many do not believe him anymore. He changes his mind too much and is known as Dr Flippin' and Floppin' We ONLY trust Dr Samendi Dr Immanuel and Dr Gold and Pres Trump.
I blame Trump #LoserInChief
I believe Vegas would put the odds at 1:1 that Trump will have a signing ceremony backed by Barr and Pompeo where he signs an ‚Äúexecutive order‚Äù to ‚Äúindefinitely delay the 2020 presidential election‚Äù. It might not be legal or binding but he will do it and the DOJ will support him.
I worry about trump in moscow. With his infirmities he's likely to fall out of a window.
In what is becoming more painful aware by the second as I watch 3 former Presidents speak- ‚ÄúWhat the fuck are we doing with this clown called Trump?‚Äù
Here in Florida, everybody I talk to including myself will vote for Trump in November.
Trump isn‚Äôt so much worried about losing than what happens to him when he loses. He is afraid of jail and rightfully so.  Also members of the family and those who use the ‚Äújust taking orders‚Äù defense should be worried too.
It's going to sting this fake news broke paper like the st pete times when President Trump wins.
The Chart shows black employment, not GDP. As a measure of economic growth, I agree that Trump‚Äôs growth is good. However, the conversation. The real median and per capita GDP of the black community has flatlined under this administration.
It would take congress (both houses) passing legislation to delay the election. It‚Äôd take a constitutional amendment to keep Trump in office past noon EST 1/20/2021
That is a satire site. Regis did not leave any money to the Trump campaign..
Umm, I learned about trump re-tweeting this doctor's claims from MSNBC.  They refused to show the clip, as its contents were DANGEROUS, and never once mentioned the doctor was black.    How do you have a blue check?  Who are you with this nonsense?
Hope Trump had jam in his pocket because he's toasted with that kind of news
When you all get off the Trump tit then I‚Äôll follow you again as I agree with a lot of your points.   But I will not caucus with fascists and racists who cannot and will not deliver the reforms needed to fix this issue.
That's a lie. Biden has committed to 3 debates. Also, tRump stumbles every time he speaks in public. His grammar is atrocious. You must not pay too much attention to him when he speaks.
That's *exactly* what Trump is doing.  Remember: for 3.5 years, he has explicitly undone, overridden, struck down, and otherwise destroyed much of what Obama worked on, created, and built. He's not done yet.
Actually, I do not. Flatlining numbers show stagnation. Trump could not continue the growth and the proof is in the numbers. If you look at them.
The tweet from President Trump, who's trailing in nearly every national poll for the Nov. 3 election, came on the same morning as the U.S. reported an economic contraction of 9.5 percent in the second quarter of 2020, an unprecedented recession.
U.S. Sen.  of Florida said, emphatically, that Election Day won‚Äôt be delayed.   The president‚Äôs suggestion is essentially impossible both logistically and legally:
Second, have you ever actually look at the income numbers? There‚Äôs been a flatline in black income since Trump.   Source: Brookings Instittute.
When asked,  said he hadn't seen  tweet.   He then explained Florida is working hard to ready itself for a Nov. 3 election:
What garbage. Herman Cain failed America, not the other way around. In campaigning for Trump, he helped sign a death warrant for well over 160,000 Americans, most of whom were innocent. Loyal Americans tried to stop him, which would have saved Cain's life.
To bad trump is complicit in his death
I am sorry for the loss of your friend &amp; former boss. I mean that. I'm also sad for Mr. Cain's family. I know that grief too well. It hurts. I'd never say anyone deserved to contract a disease &amp; die. I *will* say I wish he, &amp; many others, had listened to science instead of Trump.
If only he‚Äôd worn a mask, or skipped the Trump rally, or let God save him, or used the miracle drug hydroxychloroquine...
Did John Lewis know that President Trump gave millions of dollars to the Rainbow Coalition Sharpton's extortion racket too.
Trump, Time To RESIGN!!!
Thanks  to trump he is no longer with us
It's in the Constitution that Trump can't accept foreign emoluments - like he does every minute of every day.  It's in the Constitution that the People have the right to peacefully protest - and Trump violates that right daily.  Marco &amp; every Republican will back Trump. Be afraid
Trump has accomplished exactly what he was hoping for by starting an argument about the credibility of the the election. *Because he‚Äôs losing - if he was ahead in the polls it would be full steam ahead. #Election2020
Trump has had 4 years to prove himself. He doesn't get extra time to salvage this dumpster fire of a presidency by delaying the election. That's not how this works. #WeWillVote November 3rd.

Marco voted to allow the worst of Venezuela to help Trump steal another US Presidential election. Why can't Florida have even one Senator who is not a traitor?  Congrats to ProDeath Marco and every elected Republican for BREAKING FL DAILY DEATH RECORD 3 DAYS IN A ROW!
So do you think now trump might say he was wrong? Not a chance. Herman Cain was a ‚Äúhoaxer‚Äù and ‚Äúanti-masker‚Äù. I have NO sympathy for STUPID.
is running scared! Oops...Trump can't run! We gotcha Trump!
I love how trump wants to delay elections but doesn‚Äôt want to delay schools for k-12. What an asshole.
I think people were in shock and dismay either way I would be on an overpass waving a Trump sign with CNN Sucks on it.

Harris is correct about Trump as most corrupt president (impeached over a couple of his scandals) and that Barr continuously aides him in his wrongdoing and coverups, e.g., interference in Stone case.  If you followed the news, you could come up with many more examples!
why was he denied the trump drug, before getting infected !! no need for him and many others to die !! wakey wakey !! this  is MURDER !!
Responsible? Was he forced at gun point? Did Trump spike his drink with Covid?
Trump 2020
Too bad he died from trump's negligence
when You get the cold or skin your knee - do you blame Trump as well?  Traffic issues - blame Trump.  Some people just have to hate.
I agree. The Democrats dislike Trump so much it's shocking that they couldn't come up with a fabulous candidate. Congress needs term limits because they all get out of touch with reality.
I just gave it to you...his own sons admitted they have gotten millions in loans from the Russians. Trump himself has talked up Putin for years now.
If Donald Trump was an MLB pitcher who just signed a mega deal she‚Äôd be sucking his Cheeto. She‚Äôs wrecked more pitchers careers than torn rotator cuff. Hello Zito and Pavano!
Remember President Trump never loses. He has Mar a Lago and Trump Tower. We lose though if he loses.
President Trump will win easily.
And now he is DEAD. Because of your boss...and his lies. You are also to blame as you are his mouthpiece to the press and push the constant lies that he spews from his mouth. How will explain that to your child when they learn about Trump and you in history class?
For all the hatred that Herman Cain directed towards the gay community I cannot say FUCK YOU AND GOOD RIDDANCE loud enough. Our country is a better place today because he‚Äôs dead. And he caught COVID at a Trump rally! üòÇ Made my day. Love, Tom in St. Pete.You mean this book? Don‚Äôt worry the RNC will buy in bulk so it‚Äôs not a total flop, like it did for the previous one!

He passed away from the Trump Virus. After the first 5K deaths Trumps owns the virus and every victim's thereafter, including Herman Cain passing.
Herman Cain did not believe in wearing a mask, Trump did believe in wearing a mask.  Wearing a mask protects you from getting the virus, not completely but it help's tremendously.  He died because of the virus and supporting Trump's belief's #TrumpKillsAmericans

I am not sure if I should believe what you're saying. Say that now and say something else in the end is not the same. You called Trump a conman.and now you're bossom buddies..thanks but no thanks.
Here's his "politically liberal, through and through" hero, saying he's going to... vote for Trump.
"Through and through."  Sexism and racism are not "cultural." They are core conservative "values."  Here's your political liberal saying he'll vote for Trump. Sorry he had to make you like quite so stupid.

You must have the worst fucking logic ever... shame on those blaming Trump's TULSA rally? ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ You must be missing a lot of facts and pictures because Herman Cain should have not went to that rally. But he believed Trump's words and died from stupidity. Plain and simple.
Let's talk about Trump's call to suspend the elections....  via  #Trump #vote #Election2020 #VoteTrumpOut
MoscowMitch, Trump, &amp; DeSantis
#BidenPredictedTrumpDelayElection. Trump demands election be delayed.
Bottom line: the N.R.A. laundered Russian money into the 2016 campaign and illegally coordinated with the Trump campaign. The N.R.A. needs to have its tax-exempt status stripped. Our documentary details all of this. But we need help to get the doc out.
Delivery guy: ‚Äúno tip?‚Äù  Me: ‚Äúdon‚Äôt vote for trump!‚Äù
Trump may not be eloquent by anyone‚Äôs standards, but he is a prodigious liar.
This pathetic b/c you killed him!  Trump mourns 'American Patriot, and great friend' Herman Cain
We didn‚Äôt deserve this type of health, economic, and political climate that Trump carelessly and recklessly led us to. If he is smart he‚Äôll step down. I hear Roger Stone has room for another tattoo on his back.  Trump can end up as a tattoo on Stones back, if not it‚Äôll be worse!
Charlie, all Trump does is lie, and self-aggrandize, and talk like the fascist he is.
Did you say ballot harvesting?
I would call it more of a Nazi rally. You were still able to work with Nazi's even if you're on the wrong side. A lot of Trump's tactics are Nazi-like especially the past 2-3 months. Klan is just more of entitled and very narrow-minded White people.. not a real movement.
Yes. And that is why so many deaths are on Trump. If he had modeled and emphasized mask wearing and discouraged the push to reopen so fast fewer people would have died.
Imagine if the Republicans did that for the first two years of Trump, Now maybe you might want to reconsider that change? Harry Reed did it for all judges other than Supreme Court. Republicans than included the Supreme Court. How did that work out for you?
I mean he died from the virus... who cares if it's from the rally or not... honestly it's his fault as much as its Trump's fault.. you have to be a fucking idiot to go to a rally where you know most aren't smart enough to wear masks.
Trump's little crony. Did nothing to help him.
Call me crazy, but i think this is Trump coded speak for "dont worry i will keep POC out of your neighborhood."
That would be a lie. Trump IS a full blown racist.
What‚Äôs shocking is just the utter disrespect. I mean, Trump flat out told reporters ‚Äúno‚Äù he wouldn‚Äôt be going to pay respects to John Lewis.
Trump killed him... just like thousands of others... just for a fucking campaign rally LOL...
Trump killed him... just like thousands of others... just for a fucking campaign rally LOL...
Trump killed him... just like thousands of others... just for a fucking campaign rally LOL...
If he got help from his gubernatorial allies... we'd end up with a situation where only Blue states vote.  That would not be the outcome Trump wants. It's possible Biden could get to 270 without the deep Red states voting. Trump digs chaos, but not chaos where he loses big.
I just asked was he a hateful person, I looked up the word in the dictionary first but I wondered why John Lewis was viewed as hateful. So I asked about Trump to see how someone could say John was hateful but Trump wasn't. Its not that complicated.
It is! Stage one was COVID19- China virus. Remember Chinese government officials net wit President Trump's administration and President Trump, before we even found out about Coronavurus.
Diane: Don't blame innocent 2020. It was as shocked as we are. You can blame it on Trump. Why not? He did everything else wrong, why not this? Although todays earthquake didn't do any damage and turn to shit as everything else he touches!
Trump‚Äôs becoming a pariah. The way his kind should be treated....instead of allowed to be President.
No joke, Trump is getting off on this - the moment he realized he could tweet praise for a different black guy who just died on the same day he planned on blowing off respect for John Lewis, I‚Äôm sure a big smug grin crossed his face and he dove for his phone.
RIP to #HermanCain who died from COVID after attending a Trump rally without a mask. Not intending this as a ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù at all, but a plea to anti-maskers to maybe reconsider the whole mask thing.
I was just seeing if the person saying one person is hateful was also capable of determining if Trump was also hateful. Its called being bias, not being able to be impartial. How does me asking a question implies hatred? Even if I was fishing for a impartial opinion?
And yet the Trump Death Cult refuses to face the implications of his death squarely and instead are doubling down on their idiotic Covid mythology and butthurt about libs being means to them.
Q: Did Herman Cain tweet that masks would not be required at Trump's controversial Tulsa rally? And was that tweet subsequently deleted?  A: Yes.
Onmy under President Trump's guidelines,  cutting red tape , in such short period of time Vaccine is in such advanced stages of Development
Well he could‚Äôve been part of impeaching Trump but he‚Äôs spineless.
for the love of  can someone tell trump how to pronounce "plasma"  its not plausema
so I'm guessing trump wasn't at the funeral.....
Amazing how you and Cain and Trump and conservatives can say whatever they want, no matter how despicable, but God forbid someone criticizes a conservative, she is labeled hateful, no matter how valid the criticism. Look in the mirror.
And MBS as well, but I totally agree about Putin too. Trump is coddling all the foreign dictators &amp; tyrants from North Korea, to   Russia, to Saudi. Time to shut down Rizvi &amp; Milner. Don‚Äôt let these foreign tyrants buy up our social media. Down with fascism! #bringbackbetter
He died from the Trump Virus. You neglected to write that.
Doesn't take nerve,nor are they unaware or unconcerned.....they are the lowest common denominators a.k.a. ignorant racist trump supporters
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Is Trump a hateful person?
I‚Äôm keeping with my John Lewis groove. No Trump today.
I actually think the humiliating loss would lead to him not really returning to the job for those two months. His only agenda is ‚ÄúTrump.‚Äù He doesn‚Äôt care about what Mitch might want.   I think he‚Äôll spend December stuffing money into suitcases and arranging to leave the USA.
To encourage them all to use the free filters provided to all Flint residents? Yeah I remember that. Man, I miss the days when that was the worst thing you could come up with against a president.   My turn:
Why didn't trump share his hydroxychloroquine with Herman Cain? He could have saved him.ü§î
If you want more liberal policies than what Biden is pushing now‚Äîyou won‚Äôt get them under Trump or from a Third Party protest vote. Elect someone who will listen to you, then push them for what you want. There is no such contract to guarantee anyone‚Äôs ideas before we vote.
Congress been asking for Trump taxes for 4 years. Nigga just said ‚Äúnah, y‚Äôall can‚Äôt see that‚Äù. And nothing happened. He gonna do what he want with this election.
You are losing your hold on the Republican Party!!!  #sad #DementiaDon
If Trump want's to delay an election because it's too dangerous then children should not attend school until it is safe to do so.

Watch THE POSTMAN with kevin costner. Shows how important the postal service can be during an apocalyptic type of reality. If trump gets re-elected, we‚Äôre there.
I don‚Äôt agree with Trump about moving the election, but if he wants to hurry up and get it over with in August, I can deal.
Exactly-1.200 doesn't even pay a month of rent in LA,CA and what about DWP-cars-food-etc-life-see them big $$$$$ peeps in DC try to Survive on that-No way No Way--Trump knows-if his wife hadn't married him--she might be one of the ladies in LA, worried on this-he knows the city.
What a shame that was his own last public tweet. Trump has more ü©∏ on his hands.
Federal Court stops Trump's new "Public Charge" rules nationwide during the COVID pandemic!! This seems to mean the new Form I-944, Declaration of Self-Sufficiency will not be required, nor the invasive and extensive personal financial documentation. Questions? Call our office!
That makes me feel better. I just don‚Äôt trust trump and Barr, two truly evil people.
Not if it‚Äôs that crazy lady that is touting hydroxycloraquin which is shown to do more harm than good for COVID. Trump has a stake in the company that produces is; a Saudi company based in Malta where patent law is non existent. Trump is trying his best to move America backwards!
It‚Äôs easy.  For trump Cain became another useless black man.
They call him ‚ÄúRudy‚Äù and he used to be Trump‚Äôs lawyer before unfrozen caveman Frankenstein (Barr) took over.
And don tRump was a Democrat at two different times in his overprivlaged life of affluenza
Trump wants everyone to safely vote?But he's rushing the schools to open?Yeah right..
is a clown and should retire along with Trump, Biden, McConnell, Pelosi, Schumer and all of the other politicians over 65!  And, we need term limits now!
The  cowardice will prevent  from ever doing the right thing. They‚Äôll cheer on Trump ending elections then accuse Democrats of nonexistent voter fraud.

How can you say "our prayers"?  Trump's failed response to Covid-19 killed him.  No one believes you will pray for anyone because you lie constantly.

No, Trump and Cain are responsible for his death. Also lack of common sense. Something Republicans seem to lack since Donald Trump
Just do better. If the very real responsibility is too much for you, find another job.   The media has failed to cover Trump as he should be covered. The failure is historic and has cost lives. DO BETTER. We‚Äôre screaming because we‚Äôre dying.
You misspoke...you said Biden and you meant Trump...
Trump uses  DAILY to spread lies a/b the election, to undermine election integrity, to suppress votes, &amp; to set the stage for trying to stop or overturn the election.    need to STOP letting Trump use #Twitter to endanger elections.
Well, he call the virus a hoax and refuse to wear a mask even though underlying health conditions. What do you think?. Republican need to use their brain and common sense and not listen to a man that is dumb as rocks-Trump
Have yall noticed how TRUMP hasn‚Äôt said anything about KANYE running? ü§îNow yall knowwww ol Twitter fingers would‚Äôve had plenty to say if he wasn‚Äôt apart of this shambid #sitdownkanye

Trump said it is a Hoax.
Trump's desperation is palpable.

Yes, but Trump is an accomplice
We will all miss Mr Cain! Great American! Patriot! Self-made MAN! Now, MSM/Democrats now use this tragic loss for talking points, gain political profit and against President Trump's rally. Why..to prevent Presidential debates, as they know Biden's blubbering will be a disaster!
Mr Cain was great American! Ardes supporter of Capitalism and President Trump supporter! He will be missed! MSM, Dems use this loss to promote promote political agenda: Mask were not required on Trump's rally, BUT not forbidden!

I beginning to think why we‚Äôve seen no justice for Trump and America is most if not all the law makers have dirt on each other and to afraid to go after anybody.  Most if not all are guilty of something and that could be the #1 reason no one ever suffers the consequences
I'm really curious about who u guys voting for lol? (Only the people that dislike trump)
What‚Äôs your connection with that drug you are pushing? How much money are you making from its sales. That all you care about. Trump Virus
You literally just ignored every single argument they mare ti every screenshot that you posted in bad faith and then proceeded to make your original argument as if nothing happened. These same Trump supporters wonder why regular people think that they‚Äôre mentally challenged.

I didn't know if I will be safe living in the neighborhood with a despicable and arrogant man. Barr‚Äôs new defense of Trump actually unmasks his corruption and confirmed that he reduced his role to that of a consigliore of a mob crime family. An AG' Interference with Criminal
Trump is the logical conclusion for the GOP. Comic-strip caricature of what they have become. Overblown in ego, greed and avarice. He complements it with hate and stupidity as well.
Trump ignored the pandemic with mostly in the crowd without mask and social distancing in Texas were COVID-19 is killing so many Americans. How can you trust and respect someone who's agenda is to destroy human life. An arrogant selfish and narcissistic who is destroying us.
Now was this just because he thought he should do trump a solid, or was he specifically told to do so.

What Trump's boy who reduced his role to that of a consigliore of a mob crime family said about Trump's defiant to follow Supreme Court rulings by rejecting new applicants while launching a "comprehensive review" of DACA and whether to go forward to end the program. OUTRAGEOUS
What Trump's boy will said about his defiant relared to Supreme Court wh blocked the administration's effort to end the program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. Then two weeks ago, a court in Maryland told the administration to start accepting new DACA applicants.
The truth is that many of the questions were out of his prevue as AG and he should have answered as such. They were asked to show how far off the range he has gone. The fact that he even tried to answer shows that he thinks he has no boundaries and will protect tRump at all costs
a psychopath/sociopath has lost all ability to reason in a logical , moral coherent way!! #TRUMP is a perfect example!!

I would call it more of a Nazi rally. You were still able to work with Nazi's even if you're on the wrong side. A lot of Trump's tactics are Nazi-like especially the past 2-3 months. Klan is just more of entitled and very narrow-minded White people.. not a real movement.
Yes. And that is why so many deaths are on Trump. If he had modeled and emphasized mask wearing and discouraged the push to reopen so fast fewer people would have died.
Imagine if the Republicans did that for the first two years of Trump, Now maybe you might want to reconsider that change? Harry Reed did it for all judges other than Supreme Court. Republicans than included the Supreme Court. How did that work out for you?
I mean he died from the virus... who cares if it's from the rally or not... honestly it's his fault as much as its Trump's fault.. you have to be a fucking idiot to go to a rally where you know most aren't smart enough to wear masks.
Trump's little crony. Did nothing to help him.

RIP to #HermanCain who died from COVID after attending a Trump rally without a mask. Not intending this as a ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù at all, but a plea to anti-maskers to maybe reconsider the whole mask thing.
I was just seeing if the person saying one person is hateful was also capable of determining if Trump was also hateful. Its called being bias, not being able to be impartial. How does me asking a question implies hatred? Even if I was fishing for a impartial opinion?
This is the part where Trump‚Äôs logic becomes insanely idiotic. How does distracting people from bad news with more bad news even work?
And yet the Trump Death Cult refuses to face the implications of his death squarely and instead are doubling down on their idiotic Covid mythology and butthurt about libs being means to them.

I actually think the humiliating loss would lead to him not really returning to the job for those two months. His only agenda is ‚ÄúTrump.‚Äù He doesn‚Äôt care about what Mitch might want.   I think he‚Äôll spend December stuffing money into suitcases and arranging to leave the USA.
To encourage them all to use the free filters provided to all Flint residents? Yeah I remember that. Man, I miss the days when that was the worst thing you could come up with against a president.   My turn:
Why didn't trump share his hydroxychloroquine with Herman Cain? He could have saved him.ü§î
If you want more liberal policies than what Biden is pushing now‚Äîyou won‚Äôt get them under Trump or from a Third Party protest vote. Elect someone who will listen to you, then push them for what you want. There is no such contract to guarantee anyone‚Äôs ideas before we vote.

If Trump want's to delay an election because it's too dangerous then children should not attend school until it is safe to do so.

Opinion | Trump‚Äôs racist housing tweet is par for his family  By Jennifer Rubin
Exactly-1.200 doesn't even pay a month of rent in LA,CA and what about DWP-cars-food-etc-life-see them big $$$$$ peeps in DC try to Survive on that-No way No Way--Trump knows-if his wife hadn't married him--she might be one of the ladies in LA, worried on this-he knows the city.
What a shame that was his own last public tweet. Trump has more ü©∏ on his hands.
Federal Court stops Trump's new "Public Charge" rules nationwide during the COVID pandemic!! This seems to mean the new Form I-944, Declaration of Self-Sufficiency will not be required, nor the invasive and extensive personal financial documentation. Questions? Call our office!
That makes me feel better. I just don‚Äôt trust trump and Barr, two truly evil people.
I suppose the all out asut on this drug goes well beyond Trump. I fear science won‚Äôt even be able to settle the issue. As I‚Äôve learned from you the design and analysis of any study will be flawed are we doomed?
Bush showed up Clinton showed up Obama showed up  Donald Trump didn't show up  Rest In peace #JohnLewisfuneral
Not if it‚Äôs that crazy lady that is touting hydroxycloraquin which is shown to do more harm than good for COVID. Trump has a stake in the company that produces is; a Saudi company based in Malta where patent law is non existent. Trump is trying his best to move America backwards!
It‚Äôs easy.  For trump Cain became another useless black man.
They call him ‚ÄúRudy‚Äù and he used to be Trump‚Äôs lawyer before unfrozen caveman Frankenstein (Barr) took over.
And don tRump was a Democrat at two different times in his overprivlaged life of affluenza
Trump wants everyone to safely vote?But he's rushing the schools to open?Yeah right..
is a clown and should retire along with Trump, Biden, McConnell, Pelosi, Schumer and all of the other politicians over 65!  And, we need term limits now!
The  cowardice will prevent  from ever doing the right thing. They‚Äôll cheer on Trump ending elections then accuse Democrats of nonexistent voter fraud.

Trump floats idea of delaying the November election, a power granted to Congress, as he ramps up attacks on voting by mail By Amy Gardner and John Wagner
No, Trump and Cain are responsible for his death. Also lack of common sense. Something Republicans seem to lack since Donald Trump
Just do better. If the very real responsibility is too much for you, find another job.   The media has failed to cover Trump as he should be covered. The failure is historic and has cost lives. DO BETTER. We‚Äôre screaming because we‚Äôre dying.
You misspoke...you said Biden and you meant Trump...
Trump uses  DAILY to spread lies a/b the election, to undermine election integrity, to suppress votes, &amp; to set the stage for trying to stop or overturn the election.    need to STOP letting Trump use #Twitter to endanger elections.
Well, he call the virus a hoax and refuse to wear a mask even though underlying health conditions. What do you think?. Republican need to use their brain and common sense and not listen to a man that is dumb as rocks-Trump

We will all miss Mr Cain! Great American! Patriot! Self-made MAN! Now, MSM/Democrats now use this tragic loss for talking points, gain political profit and against President Trump's rally. Why..to prevent Presidential debates, as they know Biden's blubbering will be a disaster!
Mr Cain was great American! Ardes supporter of Capitalism and President Trump supporter! He will be missed! MSM, Dems use this loss to promote promote political agenda: Mask were not required on Trump's rally, BUT not forbidden!

I beginning to think why we‚Äôve seen no justice for Trump and America is most if not all the law makers have dirt on each other and to afraid to go after anybody.  Most if not all are guilty of something and that could be the #1 reason no one ever suffers the consequences
Last word for tonight. Then I may try to take a break.   Saying ‚Äúwhat if Trump won‚Äôt leave‚Äù is voter suppression. That is likely not your aim, but NOTHING GOOD has EVER come from telling Americans their vote won‚Äôt count and they‚Äôre helpless.   So cut it out. Please. ‚ÄòKay?
Trump hastening the deaths of his own supporters right before the election is some keen political intuition right there.
This was December. Before COVID. No way it‚Äôs improved since then. This is before the Russians paying bounties on US service heads story, too.
I saw something this year that showed Trump had lower approval ratings with the military than any Republican President in the modern age. Considering his endless disrespect for the military, it‚Äôs not surprising.
I'm really curious about who u guys voting for lol? (Only the people that dislike trump)

I'll be honest... I suspect Trump is in such poor health that, should he get COVID19, he would be pretty critical at best (I think his orange sunspray tan is to cover up a condition).

So what?  He picked it up at the rally.  Thanks to Trump, he‚Äôs dead.
my original point was that in order to defeat Trump, one must vote for Biden; especially in red or swing states.
Yes.  All us medical professionals are hero‚Äôs till a Democrat realizes we support Trump

HELLO DONALD TRUMP AND THERE ARE SOME BIBLICAL SITUATIONS THAT NEED TO BE CORRECTED BEFORE NOVEMBER!ü§îü§óüòé
What a tool trump is!
no, again there's gradients a different degrees of severity.  we have no control as peons to select the choices. so what would you have ppl do? bec another Trump term would be devasting.
Yes but they claim social injustice or what ever they call it but they make millions.  Trump will win over all this stuff going on.
true, it is, but with the astronomical chance would you rather Trump handle it or Biden?
Trump is a narcissist that cannot handle truth. Science is truth. #TrumpHatesScience
Yes. On Nov. 4th, Ms. Pelosi needs to fast track another impeachment. Once the Senate RS see how badly they lost, they'll gladly convict trump, if only as revenge for him taking them all down with him.
it's because under Trump I foresee my life continuing to be horrible. I'm disabled, and my only caretaker is my mom and she's 100% on board with Trump's rhetoric. my life is hell. so when it comes to 30% being brainwashed and the future of SCOTUS, the answer is clear.
I was pointing out both sides are to blame bro, you said well if it wasn't for trump getting rid of the pandemic task force, blah, blah, blah......point being both sides had no clue what to do, I mean China fucked us period, and you have to be blind not to see that.
I know you agree, Matt. I just could not help venting. And Trump knows as well as anyone that he's in big trouble, which is why he's ramping up the crazy. God help us..
Biden may want to arrest you, but Trump wants you dead.
that's only potentially, and definitely not racially charged and brazen like Trump's actions and rhetoric.
There is no way in hell Trump should be leading or close in any state.
Wait, Trump was in PA too?
There is no chance in hell they will let Biden debate Trump. It would be a mental massacre.
on the surface maybe. like a let's look at the Supreme Court: would you rather Trump appoint 1-2 judges for a lifetime appointment or Biden?
I fully understand all that, but having that stance will not change the candidates in November. so if you only look at it as "what is the best way for me to prevent another Trump term?" then the obvious answer is to consolidate votes behind a single opponent.
it raises the percentage of people that vote for Trump because it no longer dilutes it in the existing two party system. so his chances increase in swing states with the electoral college.
because it doesn't help the opposing candidate with the most votes to win. so that's how it benefits Trump, by not hurting him.
Cofounder of the federalist society says he now agrees with Dems that Trump is a fascist and that he should be immediately removed from office.
I support President Trump, but the Cornavirus package should be about the people in need and not the White House renovation or a new FBI building.
over who the DNC decides to f*ck us over with. we don't have control over that, but we do have control over whether or not Trump has another term.
which will only symbolically show something and potentially provide Trump a higher number of the total % of votes. so in a blue state that doesn't matter as much, but in a swing state it does.
you and I have no control over that situation. so if you would like to prevent another Trump term you can exercise your right to vote to do so. otherwise you're not.
sure, but holding votes hostage, will most likely not change those things. so in order to prevent another Trump term, it'ss most important to consolidate votes. the real core policy changes happen in the DNC committee.
sure, and what of a future Trump term? you're just ok with allowing that to happen?
the DNC f*cked us over, the candidates f*cking suck. but if you don't want Trump to our next pandemic, then the only resolution is to consolidate votes behind a single opponent. voting for any other candidates, although symbolic is a lost vote. as in it won't aid the winner.
how can voting for a candidate that has 100% chance to lose not benefit Trump?
and although that is symbolic, in essence that aids Trump's possible win.
I understand that, I just think it can happen in future elections and not when Trump is f*cking president
and Trump is?
yes, he does, but he hasn't released a future budget that cuts SSDI and Medicare $880B; Trump has. I'm disabled and rely on those programs. he also won't gas peaceful protesters in order to have a photo op with a Bible in front of a Church.
Umm.. so not cool that these comments are freakin HYSTERICAL
So there is your "intellegence".....if that doesn't make you "wonder" why Trump started "defunding WHO"......well then it's fairly obvious there was a lot moving parts in the virus.
Trump is the only President that I've seen that discourages voting.
the most logical way to beat Trump is to consolidate votes behind one single candidate to win. it's just a matter of fact. so if you don't want Trump to potentially handle a covid-22, then one would have to unfortunately vote for Biden to prevent that.
I don't know bro, The Who said it wasn't an issue back then, that's the sole purpose they are funded, so what are suppose to do? Trump was called a racist for cutting off China Travel early on, Monday Morning Quarterbacking at its finest I guess.
Or maybe he deserves it? I just want the filth of trump gone from my life.
What planet are you on.    Trump will win in a landslide.   The silent majority is real.

The biggest landslide in history: Same prediction the entire MSM made in 2016 ‚Äî- how‚Äôd that work out for you. And to think, there was actually a candidate running against Trump in 2016. This year Biden doesn‚Äôt even know he‚Äôs running.

To the Republicans who also stopped supporting Trump like myself, I want to encourage that it's OK to say you were wrong about Obama, I did. It's a positive way to show the other side that you are human and it can help build trust with each other. We need that now in this fight.

In coming speeches Trump's ass is grass, and Obama's the lawn mower.
Trump needs to fasten his seatbelt. Obama was going to cut loose on him until November, AND beyond.
If the mail in ballot is  so bad why did Trump send out info to people via mail this week on how to obtain a mail in ballot.
Would-be dictator Donald Trump would be unstoppable in a second term. That must not happen
If you follow Dems, you will know that "Do nothing Dems" from Trump and his pundits are a flat out lie. Dems are fighting all sorts of missions for the people.
The passing of a trump token, Herman was no more than a photo op to Trump. It's very sad somebody else bought into Trump's bullshit  not believing the scientists and the experts to practice safe social distancing and wearing a mask.
Did Trump actually bleach himself?
Well Don if the democrats decide to cheat like they did in 2016 i guarantee you President Trump we'll get to the bottom of it so that the elections are uncheatable.
It's going really well actually and has taken off. Have you followed  that's another group showing there's plenty of former Trump supporters.
Trump throws a temper tantrum over a respectful criticism over his undoing, yet Barack Obama was demonized, threatened, defamed, and yet it never bothered him. It still amazes me why I never questioned conservative propaganda. He is nothing at all of what they say about him.
I used to watched Fox News, I believed in the birther, and the hateful lies about him. When I learned the truth about liberal values, I've learned to truth about Dem politicians like Obama, how did the demonizing not bother him, like how Trump is bothered by criticism.

Why do you continue to support Donald Trump when he has proven he shows zero regard for the American people's safety or well-being?  His COVID response alone should be enough to lose him this election. Let alone everything else.
both are horrible. but neither explicitly elicited violence or tear gas against peaceful protesters. I know he sucks. but if you don't want 4 more years of Trump. logically it makes the most sense to consolidate votes behind a single opponent.
it's history; not what's proposed. we know 100% what Trump wants.
You must be joking !! He's a Russian sympathizer. A vote for tRumP is insane !! How bout appx 20,000 lies? Bounties on our soldiers?? Using military forces to make a photo op?? He's a racist. He's a womanizing narrcisistic LOOSER !! Oh yeah a bully and a big BABY !!  Embarrassing

Being on both sides, the commentary that doesn't support Trump is much more intelligent, thought out, &amp; logical compared to MAGA commentary. It makes sense why MSM was always dismissed as fake news because they don't want people to be able to think for themselves by using logic.

Sweetheart, do you actually think Trump has ever read the Bible? And do we just wake up in a new day being forgiven? Even having done nothing to deserve it? So he can go on each day being a sexual predator and racist, but will wake up the next full of grace?

What a tool trump is!
no, again there's gradients a different degrees of severity.  we have no control as peons to select the choices. so what would you have ppl do? bec another Trump term would be devasting.
Yes but they claim social injustice or what ever they call it but they make millions.  Trump will win over all this stuff going on.
true, it is, but with the astronomical chance would you rather Trump handle it or Biden?
Trump is a narcissist that cannot handle truth. Science is truth. #TrumpHatesScience
Yes. On Nov. 4th, Ms. Pelosi needs to fast track another impeachment. Once the Senate RS see how badly they lost, they'll gladly convict trump, if only as revenge for him taking them all down with him.
it's because under Trump I foresee my life continuing to be horrible. I'm disabled, and my only caretaker is my mom and she's 100% on board with Trump's rhetoric. my life is hell. so when it comes to 30% being brainwashed and the future of SCOTUS, the answer is clear.
I was pointing out both sides are to blame bro, you said well if it wasn't for trump getting rid of the pandemic task force, blah, blah, blah......point being both sides had no clue what to do, I mean China fucked us period, and you have to be blind not to see that.
I know you agree, Matt. I just could not help venting. And Trump knows as well as anyone that he's in big trouble, which is why he's ramping up the crazy. God help us..
Biden may want to arrest you, but Trump wants you dead.
that's only potentially, and definitely not racially charged and brazen like Trump's actions and rhetoric.
There is no way in hell Trump should be leading or close in any state.
There is no chance in hell they will let Biden debate Trump. It would be a mental massacre.
on the surface maybe. like a let's look at the Supreme Court: would you rather Trump appoint 1-2 judges for a lifetime appointment or Biden?
I fully understand all that, but having that stance will not change the candidates in November. so if you only look at it as "what is the best way for me to prevent another Trump term?" then the obvious answer is to consolidate votes behind a single opponent.
MAGA, Trump doesn‚Äôt care about you, wake up.
The younger the better? Epstein Trump Maxwell
it raises the percentage of people that vote for Trump because it no longer dilutes it in the existing two party system. so his chances increase in swing states with the electoral college.
because it doesn't help the opposing candidate with the most votes to win. so that's how it benefits Trump, by not hurting him.
Cofounder of the federalist society says he now agrees with Dems that Trump is a fascist and that he should be immediately removed from office.
I support President Trump, but the Cornavirus package should be about the people in need and not the White House renovation or a new FBI building.
over who the DNC decides to f*ck us over with. we don't have control over that, but we do have control over whether or not Trump has another term.
which will only symbolically show something and potentially provide Trump a higher number of the total % of votes. so in a blue state that doesn't matter as much, but in a swing state it does.
you and I have no control over that situation. so if you would like to prevent another Trump term you can exercise your right to vote to do so. otherwise you're not.
sure, but holding votes hostage, will most likely not change those things. so in order to prevent another Trump term, it'ss most important to consolidate votes. the real core policy changes happen in the DNC committee.
sure, and what of a future Trump term? you're just ok with allowing that to happen?
the DNC f*cked us over, the candidates f*cking suck. but if you don't want Trump to our next pandemic, then the only resolution is to consolidate votes behind a single opponent. voting for any other candidates, although symbolic is a lost vote. as in it won't aid the winner.
how can voting for a candidate that has 100% chance to lose not benefit Trump?
and although that is symbolic, in essence that aids Trump's possible win.
I understand that, I just think it can happen in future elections and not when Trump is f*cking president
and Trump is?
yes, he does, but he hasn't released a future budget that cuts SSDI and Medicare $880B; Trump has. I'm disabled and rely on those programs. he also won't gas peaceful protesters in order to have a photo op with a Bible in front of a Church.
Umm.. so not cool that these comments are freakin HYSTERICAL
So there is your "intellegence".....if that doesn't make you "wonder" why Trump started "defunding WHO"......well then it's fairly obvious there was a lot moving parts in the virus.
Trump is the only President that I've seen that discourages voting.
the most logical way to beat Trump is to consolidate votes behind one single candidate to win. it's just a matter of fact. so if you don't want Trump to potentially handle a covid-22, then one would have to unfortunately vote for Biden to prevent that.
I don't know bro, The Who said it wasn't an issue back then, that's the sole purpose they are funded, so what are suppose to do? Trump was called a racist for cutting off China Travel early on, Monday Morning Quarterbacking at its finest I guess.
Pompous Pompeo refuses to answer the simple question, instead stutters and deflects. He‚Äôs a key player in Trump‚Äôs con, along with Barr.

Would-be dictator Donald Trump would be unstoppable in a second term. That must not happen
If you follow Dems, you will know that "Do nothing Dems" from Trump and his pundits are a flat out lie. Dems are fighting all sorts of missions for the people.
The passing of a trump token, Herman was no more than a photo op to Trump. It's very sad somebody else bought into Trump's bullshit  not believing the scientists and the experts to practice safe social distancing and wearing a mask.
Did Trump actually bleach himself?
Well Don if the democrats decide to cheat like they did in 2016 i guarantee you President Trump we'll get to the bottom of it so that the elections are uncheatable.
It's going really well actually and has taken off. Have you followed  that's another group showing there's plenty of former Trump supporters.
Trump throws a temper tantrum over a respectful criticism over his undoing, yet Barack Obama was demonized, threatened, defamed, and yet it never bothered him. It still amazes me why I never questioned conservative propaganda. He is nothing at all of what they say about him.
I used to watched Fox News, I believed in the birther, and the hateful lies about him. When I learned the truth about liberal values, I've learned to truth about Dem politicians like Obama, how did the demonizing not bother him, like how Trump is bothered by criticism.
Share  video far and wide because what will it take for Americans to do the thing like wear a damn mask. What will it take for MAGA to realize Trump doesn't care about them because they are literally #dyingforTrump

Fox News, Trump, and many Republican pundits have been down playing #COVID19, how many lives lost will it take for them to be held accountable. I really believe Twitter needs to act on their misinformation to prevent more deaths.
Herman Cain died from coronavirus. Does that matter to you? How many in this line will get it and die? Guess they're willing to die for trump.

Trump is not attending John Lewis‚Äô funeral.  What an asshole!
You don't need a PHD in History to point out that we voted right on schedule in 1864 with the Civil War still raging. I think we can handle this. Trump is trying to distract from the fact that the GDP just took a dump of about 1/3.

I said four years ago before he took office, that he would cause a civil war. And everything he has done has been to that extreme, and the GOP which has never had the people in mind, only their corporate owners. Trump will find a way to permanently stay and office, be ready.
Sweeping under the rug doesn‚Äôt begin to describe this situation. Always knew trump was a stupid egotistical person. But... this is a new type of low. Everyone involved should face severe consequences. But as usual Trump is untouchable. Frustrating!

Why do you continue to support Donald Trump when he has proven he shows zero regard for the American people's safety or well-being?  His COVID response alone should be enough to lose him this election. Let alone everything else.
both are horrible. but neither explicitly elicited violence or tear gas against peaceful protesters. I know he sucks. but if you don't want 4 more years of Trump. logically it makes the most sense to consolidate votes behind a single opponent.
it's history; not what's proposed. we know 100% what Trump wants.
So, Trump did read the report on the Russian bounty on our soldiers when it was first mentioned and lied saying he didn‚Äôt know about it.
You must be joking !! He's a Russian sympathizer. A vote for tRumP is insane !! How bout appx 20,000 lies? Bounties on our soldiers?? Using military forces to make a photo op?? He's a racist. He's a womanizing narrcisistic LOOSER !! Oh yeah a bully and a big BABY !!  Embarrassing

My point is this, learn from our mistake because a no vote is a vote for Trump who is no where near like Biden.
I understand never Biden "progressives" may have trouble trusting us former Trump supporters, but If we could break free from cult MAGA &amp; regret that our vote has put our country in the state of where it's at, then maybe listen to us voting for Biden would save our Democracy.
I know I live in the weeds here and want some specific answers from Bezos about 3P seller data, but it's *crazy* to me that they're wading through Uighurs, the JEDI contract, Trump Jr.'s tweets, Google hidden lyrics and so much more all in one hearing. #antitrusthearing
Being on both sides, the commentary that doesn't support Trump is much more intelligent, thought out, &amp; logical compared to MAGA commentary. It makes sense why MSM was always dismissed as fake news because they don't want people to be able to think for themselves by using logic.
Thank you üôè President Trump!!!!!
Hillary Clinton was right about Trump, she is right about Joe Biden, that is the tweet.
Trump's refusal to show up for his funeral speaks volume.

Last point, if you think Biden is the same as Trump, you are in a cult.
It's not a valid point. Opting out of voting is helping Trump which closes the door of any pathway to progressivism. It means more conservative judges, more years of tyranny this is a selfish bratty move and people have died in this country to fight for their right to vote.
First thing I think of when I see the American flag is trumpism and the Orange Idiot that's ruining our country.   I practically had to force myself to put a small US flag on my front door on July 4, something I never had second thoughts about before tRump.  #nevermypresident
Please don‚Äôt give into Trump on the a New FBI BUILDING in the COVID-19 Bill.  Trump is crazy.
I believe Joe Biden has a better chance to beat Trump than Sanders. A Joe Biden presidency is a realistic pathway to progressivsim. Joe Biden's policies are a great first step for our country to move in the right direction.
Sweetheart, do you actually think Trump has ever read the Bible? And do we just wake up in a new day being forgiven? Even having done nothing to deserve it? So he can go on each day being a sexual predator and racist, but will wake up the next full of grace?
Everything that MAGA accuses Dems of doing is the projection of what Trump actually does.
Trump only thinks of what is good for Trump and what he can get out of it.
A person can go from supporting Trump, defending manipulation of the 2nd amendment, manipulation of immigration, the hateful world view of Islam, to thinking racism was over in the 60's, that everyone has to pay for medical care, kneeling for the flag is offensive to Military to

Trump doesn't give a s*** about American kids in school nor Americans losing their houses and evictions. Don't be so naive.
Trump doesn't like peaceful protest he only likes chaos.
This is the Trump campaign shifting gears.
Trump says he has not spoken to Putin about alleged Russian bounties on U.S. troops  our troops are at risk &amp; he won't do anything, because I think Putin has something on him and Trumps afraid of him. I wonder how much money Trump owes Russia?

Heels up Harris. Fraud liar and cheat. Vote for Trump and Straight Republican in 2020.
What happened to Herman Cain was predicted.  Trump knew it would happen to a percentage of attendees.  That‚Äôs why he made them sign a liability waiver.  He was ok with it as long as he got to have his rally.  I can‚Äôt understand why both sides aren‚Äôt outraged.
Imbecil, that's why Trump did prison reform, because police, including elite FBI, bully people into taking a plea. They do it to minorities too often or any one who is their enemy. These agencies have too much power.
Sounds like Trump is trying to cheat by electronic voting and vote by mail blocks that.
It‚Äôs fairly clear that he chose to vilify the science behind mask use to please Trump. He put his faith in a charlatan rather than the true experts. That loyalty ultimately cost him his life.

I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any evidence to support your claim that Trump wants to place black people below white people. There have been no actions or statements that support that. I was trying to go straight for WHY you would perceive things that way.
The color of evil is putrid Orange to think a president could actually delay the elections is ridiculous? Trump you have no power to delay the election! It won't happen! You might try to sue 36 or 37 States when you lose to Joe Biden but it won't work! #dumpTrump
That reasoning never crossed Trump‚Äôs mind.

Those comments are inappropriate &amp; totally unnecessary at this time. Whatever your opinions about Trump or political disagreements with him were, this is NOT the time to talk about him repenting before his tragic passing. God bless the Cain family, friends, etc...

I rarely, if ever, swear in public, Twitter or Facebook. But I find myself swearing at the TV when GOP goons like Gym Jordan, Doug Collins, Mnuchin, Nunes, and, of course, their Idiot-in-Chief Trump open their mouths. No one else makes my blood boil as much as they do. üòñ üò°

So, so sad. Herman Cain contracted COVID-19 at Trump‚Äôs rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma where social distancing signs were removed by Trump campaign staffers and masks were not required. I hope you‚Äôre proud of yourself, Mr. President. Cain‚Äôs death was a result of YOUR negligence.
Thanks! I must assume, then, that you recognized the character played by Robert Duvall in that pic and the implied connection to my joke about Eric Trump, n'est ce pas? Hope you chuckled to yourself! üòé
I sense desperation in the air....your years as an enabler to Donald Trump are costing you.
Very apparent, Trump will never be called eulogize anyone....besides, will they let him out of prison to do it.
Think about this one. I have seen every past president be able to cite Bible verses like Obama did in today‚Äôs eulogy. But never once from Trump. What a fraud.
Obama‚Äôs eulogy was very inspiring. I miss a President who can deliver an inspirational message that is positive and filled with unity and hope. We lost something precious when we got saddled with Trump.
Thank you! He praised Trump 4 not making masks mandatory for the July 4th rally. He said (in caps): "people are fed up". He was a selfish pig. I save my sadness 4 the innocent pple who died because of them. The chickens have come home to roost! Ana is not rude just factual!
I want all trump administration gone ASAP and GOP. They are all scum. The ride has been very bad. Killing Americans should have been stopped. We stopped being USA. A lot of people need to lose their jobs in the next administration. FBI and CIA and generals. All at the top.
Or goes to jail... Cain was a big boy. He, along w/ Trump &amp; the rest of the goons, have caused many innocent people to die. He praised Trump 4 not making masks mandatory for the July 4th rally &amp; said that "people are fed up" (in caps). They deleted it today.
doesn't care, he's a loyalist.  But he better be careful, those close to Trump are testing positive and now sadly dying. I do not know if DeSantis has any health issues other than being overweight. Maybe his  family can be of influence for his sake if not for ours
Judging by my Twitter timeline, I think I may be the only one who is quite pleased that Trump didn‚Äôt go to John Lewis‚Äô funeral.
WOW! what a service #JohnLewisMemorial . What I am curious to know is why Trump was not at the services? As a leader of this country he should have been there.
And Trump has the audacity to offer condolences to Mr. Cain's grieving family without taking responsibility for hosting a senseless rally during a global pandemic.
Makes you wonder what President Trump is actually up to doesn‚Äôt it? I trust
And nobody knew it until ‚ÄúProfessor‚Äù Trump told us.
And trump doesn't care because he has no soul!

I'm Donald J. Trump and I approve this message.
Did anyone put a clock on how long it took Mad King Trump to mention John Lewis after his death?
Given the way he's running his campaign, you have to wonder:  What does the President have on Donald J. Trump?
You have to keep in mind that Trump's biggest supporters are Nazis &amp; white supremacists.  These people love his racism.  He's one of them.  Has anyone ever checked his closet for his white hood &amp; robe?
BOOM!!!
Trump and Barr are unconstitutional thugs running Stormtroopers in cities, yet many want a national mask mandate and Federal law enforcement out there arresting people not wearing. Bet if a guy got gassed,  beat and dragged off by cops for no mask they would cheer it
No. It‚Äôs really bad. Like Stephanie Meyers wrote 2020. Like trump is the emotional immature Edward and we are all Bella.
What I would expect on  tonight. Top story will be a live report from the NY pizza restaurant that trump tweeted out. In the 57th minute, there will be a snippet of video of Obama, Bush and Clinton speaking at John Lewis service
Even if delayed, Trump still leaves office at noon on January 20th, 2021. Absolutely nothing changes that.
Trump could never give a speech/eulogy because he can't talk about anyone but himself.  I love and miss Obama so much!!

Something is missing in Trump. Something essential to being human. Bush made some very bad decisions and listened to some people he shouldn't have. He is a much better ex president then he was a president.

Experts dismiss Trump claim that it could take 'years' to declare election winner
Every traditional Republican understands that mail in / absentee voting is a Republican strong point.    But trump  was  a Democrat all his life, so of course he does not understand that.
Well, I‚Äôm glad you are coming around... please &amp; always, vote... Voting by mail has been done for a long long time and has less than .002% of fraud‚Äîthe only reason Trump doesn‚Äôt want vote by mail is because if people vote, he loses!
The one that pisses me off the worst is Trump 2020...no more bullshit.  As if the last 3 1/2 years have been anything but!
Provided we elect President Trump for 4 more years, we are vulnerable to these rejects all over again in 4 more years!

Along with other 60000 deaths after reopening...Trump beats Milosevic, Idi Amin, Pinochet.. he wants to get to at least 10Th place on the Murderous Dictator list. #TrumpVirus
He passed away from the Trump Virus. After the first 5K deaths Trumps owns the virus and every victim's thereafter, including Herman Cain passing.
It‚Äôs because those reporters were chosen to ask those questions. Anyone with balls enough to ask about putin bounties or trump‚Äôs epic failure on c19 might receive an angry tweet or lose access. Oh the horror.
Don‚Äôt you think he was tested before he was allowed so close to Trump? Herman Cain is tragedy but it‚Äôs about individual choices.
Does Trump even realize that older people get their insulin and other very important medications via the USPS. They have done this month after month and their lives depend on it.
Getting rid of kushner is just as important as ousting trump.  The Biden team needs to campaign on the entire team of asshats that will be gone when he‚Äôs elected. It‚Äôs a huge selling point.
Herman Cain did not believe in wearing a mask, Trump did believe in wearing a mask.  Wearing a mask protects you from getting the virus, not completely but it help's tremendously.  He died because of the virus and supporting Trump's belief's #TrumpKillsAmericans
Of course he is. Trump is going to undermine the results and declare himself the winner. Welcome to authoritarian rule! Democracy and the USA is finished.

Yes. And that is why so many deaths are on Trump. If he had modeled and emphasized mask wearing and discouraged the push to reopen so fast fewer people would have died.
Imagine if the Republicans did that for the first two years of Trump, Now maybe you might want to reconsider that change? Harry Reed did it for all judges other than Supreme Court. Republicans than included the Supreme Court. How did that work out for you?
Very apparent, Trump will never be called eulogize anyone....besides, will they let him out of prison to do it.
I mean he died from the virus... who cares if it's from the rally or not... honestly it's his fault as much as its Trump's fault.. you have to be a fucking idiot to go to a rally where you know most aren't smart enough to wear masks.
Your right it‚Äôs just disappointing to have Trump as our President

Or goes to jail... Cain was a big boy. He, along w/ Trump &amp; the rest of the goons, have caused many innocent people to die. He praised Trump 4 not making masks mandatory for the July 4th rally &amp; said that "people are fed up" (in caps). They deleted it today.

Hey Palmer, maybe you could help me with this question... at the end of August 2016 Hillary was leading Trump in almost every major poll and we all know what happened at the end... how can we be sure that‚Äôs not going to happen again?
Makes you wonder what President Trump is actually up to doesn‚Äôt it? I trust
Parents aren‚Äôt going to send their children to slaughter for you and who you pray to (Trump). You decided to listen to the lies about the virus ü¶† from Trump and his enablers. You reap what you sow. You are following the Herman Cain path.
And yet the Trump Death Cult refuses to face the implications of his death squarely and instead are doubling down on their idiotic Covid mythology and butthurt about libs being means to them.

So many Republicans are supporting Biden and expressing their dissatisfaction with trump.  Just repeating, if trump had run as a Democrat I would have voted Republican without blinking.   It's not about party or "my guy winning", it's about the right person and he's not it.
Something is missing in Trump. Something essential to being human. Bush made some very bad decisions and listened to some people he shouldn't have. He is a much better ex president then he was a president.
For real? I didn‚Äôt know that... wow. Rudy... you should be ashatof yourself. Like trump loves to say ‚Äúthat is nasty‚Äù. Lmao. ü§Æ
I have no words for thes four other than Trump ass kissers!

It‚Äôs because those reporters were chosen to ask those questions. Anyone with balls enough to ask about putin bounties or trump‚Äôs epic failure on c19 might receive an angry tweet or lose access. Oh the horror.
Does Trump even realize that older people get their insulin and other very important medications via the USPS. They have done this month after month and their lives depend on it.
Getting rid of kushner is just as important as ousting trump.  The Biden team needs to campaign on the entire team of asshats that will be gone when he‚Äôs elected. It‚Äôs a huge selling point.
Of course he is. Trump is going to undermine the results and declare himself the winner. Welcome to authoritarian rule! Democracy and the USA is finished.
This is why Donald Trump is president. Racists like this.
Absolutely correct, Governor DeSantis sits at the knee of Trump, both must be voted out
Trump does not care about Americans period he‚Äôs a socio pathic career narcissist and we don‚Äôt need Mary trumps book to tell us that. He‚Äôs a career liar .
Trump‚Äôs comments on rescheduling the elections convinces me further that he won‚Äôt accept the election results if he loses.
Our idiot Governor DeathSantis is listening to his master Trump. He's a darn mini Trump. He's going to get voted out.
No. I didn't get to make my point. Would you mind listing the things Trump has done if it's convenient?

Too late, he sat by and did nothing while Trump betrayed his oath, our country and allies.
Remember over the spring many ‚Äúprimaries‚Äù got delayed/changed to accomodate the shut down. State govs may be inclined to change election dates/mail by dates in an effort to ‚Äúaccomodate‚Äù (ie: round up) voters.   Trump knows whatever he proposes Dems will be against. HydroxyC, etc.
That didn't age well.. I don't want to speak ill will of the dead but he was a grown man that chose to ride or die with this hoax and paid for it. he literally died for Trump.
Trump's admiration of dictators probably getting lessons on how to take a democracy to a authoritarian dictatorship using our own judiciary and laws against us.
I believe Trump is responsible for all the COVID deaths
Dana Perino! Wasn't she the press secretary  for Bush? That was the worst administration in history...I mean until the Trump administration
The covid response was a total disaster for Trump. Instead of asserting himself as a strong leader who didn‚Äôt prescribe to the mob mentally he went along with the narrative from the shutdown imbeciles and lunatics. If anything is going to be his undoing it will be this.

I actually do get along with him. We just disagree on Trump. Thanks for your input, I feel like a much more fulfilled human being. Don't forget to inject bleach against COVID-19 and protect yourself at night from demon sex..
I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any evidence to support your claim that Trump wants to place black people below white people. There have been no actions or statements that support that. I was trying to go straight for WHY you would perceive things that way.
Don't believe this guy; he's as anti trump as they come. "Science" is trash when the analysis is designed to come out a certain way.  #hydroxichloroquine
Trump said that he could shoot somebody and they'd still support him. Well he didn't need a gun in this case.
The color of evil is putrid Orange to think a president could actually delay the elections is ridiculous? Trump you have no power to delay the election! It won't happen! You might try to sue 36 or 37 States when you lose to Joe Biden but it won't work! #dumpTrump
That reasoning never crossed Trump‚Äôs mind.
Pogue is an anti-trump with 100s of anti-trump tweets, including disparaging tweets about Sarah Sanders.  Which means his "analysis" has ZERO credibility. He has a clear agenda.  #Hydroxychloroquine
Here‚Äôs Herman Cain at Trump‚Äôs Tulsa Campaign Rally where he likely contracted COVID. No mask. No social distancing.  Stupidly following Donald Trump in denial of the virus... #TrumpKillsAmerica

Sorry, that makes no sense whatsoever. People die in pandemics, and b I'm sorry fur your loss. However, while Obama acted decisively to fight against H1N1, Trump has done the exact opposite. He has countered and maligned the very people he should have been listening to along.
Mad King Trump has finally latched onto an issue that his #MAGA base is sure to rally around: No election.
Trump is such a child. President Bush gave a eulogy at John Lewis‚Äòs funeral even though John Lewis didn‚Äôt go to Bush‚Äôs inauguration because of the Al Gore/BUSCH recount election. Trump didn‚Äôt even pay respects to Lewis when he was lying in state in the Capitol. Not presidential.
What more does McConnell want out of trump, he could make trump resign tomorrow and run with pence and haley, but this is the party of trump...they are all trump now.
Well almost 4 years in , we know Donald J Trump is not an elected official ! he was placed in office by the Russians. #DonaldTrumpIsIllegitimate
Trump doesn‚Äôt care if more of his voters vote by mail. Trump doesn‚Äôt care if vote by mail is popular. The best opportunity Republicans have to suppress the vote is by reducing the number of urban voting sites where voters can vote. That‚Äôs the plan!
First of all, Pomeo‚Äôs smirk aside, he‚Äôs clearly not in in ‚Äúthe joke‚Äù, secondly, didn‚Äôt Trump tell us recently he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt kid‚Äù?

Very apparent, Trump will never be called eulogize anyone....besides, will they let him out of prison to do it.
Think about this one. I have seen every past president be able to cite Bible verses like Obama did in today‚Äôs eulogy. But never once from Trump. What a fraud.
Your right it‚Äôs just disappointing to have Trump as our President
Obama‚Äôs eulogy was very inspiring. I miss a President who can deliver an inspirational message that is positive and filled with unity and hope. We lost something precious when we got saddled with Trump.
Thank you! He praised Trump 4 not making masks mandatory for the July 4th rally. He said (in caps): "people are fed up". He was a selfish pig. I save my sadness 4 the innocent pple who died because of them. The chickens have come home to roost! Ana is not rude just factual!
. is a partisan hack. And a Trump-sucking sycophant. And an asshole.
I want all trump administration gone ASAP and GOP. They are all scum. The ride has been very bad. Killing Americans should have been stopped. We stopped being USA. A lot of people need to lose their jobs in the next administration. FBI and CIA and generals. All at the top.
Thanks to Trump and his corrupt leadership for our country going through this terrible epidemic Virus! All Trump cares about is his real estate and his selfish needs to be against the Medical professionals that we have to unite as a country to get this Virus out! Trumpüëéü§•
Why not flip flop it would extend your demise. If you support trump you‚Äôre a racist.
Biden did not say that Trump will achieve it, Biden said that he would try. In in fact, thats what Trump said he wants to do. So you  were/are wrong.
Or goes to jail... Cain was a big boy. He, along w/ Trump &amp; the rest of the goons, have caused many innocent people to die. He praised Trump 4 not making masks mandatory for the July 4th rally &amp; said that "people are fed up" (in caps). They deleted it today.
doesn't care, he's a loyalist.  But he better be careful, those close to Trump are testing positive and now sadly dying. I do not know if DeSantis has any health issues other than being overweight. Maybe his  family can be of influence for his sake if not for ours
He needs flippers &amp; a Speedo!
Completely agree. But theres that filibuster rule, etc, plus each member of the senate would have to give a little speach abt why Trump is evil, etc.   Maybe they could do it faster. Obvi, it would be priority #1. Trump would be on lockdown!!  Lol
Have they heard Herman Cain just died because of trump virus??
Obama's jab at Trump gets standing ovation

So instead of entertaining an idea as absurd as Trump unilaterally delaying an election, something which there is no mechanism for him to do, let‚Äôs instead worry about how we‚Äôre going to hold that election in the middle of a pandemic.
The question is not whether we will have an election on November 3rd. It‚Äôs whether or not Trump is able to sow enough chaos to squeak out a win. At best, what he‚Äôs doing now is just him trying to delegitimize Biden‚Äôs victory, not actually delay an election.
I know it can feel like Trump can do anything sometimes, but he can‚Äôt. He is repeatedly stopped in the courts, by congress, and by his own ineptitude. The only stuff he does get away with is stuff that involves Senate Republicans or his own cronies.
Then January 20th arrives. California held its elections so Pelosi is re-elected. Trump is constitutionally forced to leave. The Roberts court will deny any challenges because it‚Äôs CLEARLY SPELLED OUT. Pelosi is sworn in. Trump is kicked out by the secret service.
Most of the illegal shit Trump‚Äôs done has been confined to things the toadies in his own administration are willing to do. In order to delay the election WITHOUT congressional approval, he‚Äôs going to need to be able to simply declare ‚Äúelection‚Äôs off,‚Äù and...
Alright, genuine question: what mechanism is Trump going to use to delay the 2020 election?
TRUMP supporters are now saying Dems created this virus to make him look bad  and once he‚Äôs gone it will miraculously disappear!  Another great reason to vote Joe folks.
Interesting how Trump thinks we can‚Äôt have a safe election under Covid, but we can send our children back to school. #DumpTrump2020 #BlackLivesMatter #freeandfairelections

Yay, Fox and Limbaugh and friends!! Got you hooked on some major nonsense. China was ‚Äúpropagated‚Äù?? How has Trump dealt with Russia for 4 yrs?? The ‚Äúpallets of cash‚Äù thing is pure propaganda. Isis, North Korea comments are just silly.
Your Trump interview was pathetic.
So, those people who voted for Trump because "He tells it like it is," how are you feeling about his tweets and speeches?
Trump has a schedule?
Please see specifically the method of counting, not validation.  Trump's dream is to suppress.  He has zero other recourse.  The media is trapping people.
You mean because Trump closed the border and stopped foreign flights while the left sat there and called him racist? Oh yeah.
Barr did not know that legally Trump cannot change the election date. Why didn't he know something so basic? Isn't he the AG?
And after all that Donald Trump was still able to kill him
Trump always plays right into Putin‚Äôs hands.
So many of us are on to Trump. He‚Äôs so transparent.
Trump, you are the biggest asshole to ever run this country.  Bitch be be gone.  You are the virus that effects us.
Trump Says-  I Think He's A Little OFF when he says "The Younger" are Immune or LESS at Risk to Contract the Corona Virus"  I Think Anyone Born Between 1960/65 to 1990/95 Developed A Tough Immune System based on Those Times they Lived In &amp; Things that They had to deal with!   ???
I almost forgot about those liability waivers Trump had people sign for his COVID rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
I could only listen to #Trump for a few minutes.  He is playing the victim role right now. He is experiencing severe #NarcissisticInjury.  He is depressed, paranoid and delusional.  In my opionion, this is dangerous. I am concerned about his state of mind and what he may do.
Completely unbelievable. A desperate Trump is a dangerous Trump and we're getting nowhere with this guy.

Mr. Rather, traditions of Presidential behavior Trump violated were hard won and too easily lost.  He has permanently damaged the Union because under similar circumstances good men/women will fail to protect the Union.  Only Divine Providence can hold the Union together now.

I feel no guilt in saying I have zero remorse for these people.  They encouraged millions to risk their lives to please Trump, and they led by example. Their deaths should serve as an example, too.  This is not a thing I would have said four years ago. Blame Trump &amp; his enablers.

Looks like Dr Birx gave up trying to somehow educate Trump and is speaking truth to America. Late, but better than never. It will be interesting to see if Trump throws her under the same bus as he has thrown Fauci.
On one hand, Trump‚Äôs crimes are so many and so blatant, it‚Äôs hard to imagine them being ignored.  But I‚Äôll bet it‚Äôs also awfully tempting to just do what they did with Bush, and just focus on the legislative agenda.  And even there we probably won‚Äôt do enough.
I am afraid Trump will try to use "emergency powers" to force a delay in the election. We must be prepared for that eventuality.
Pelosi and Reid let Bush skate because they thought impeachment would be an electoral loser. When Obama won, no effort was made to punish members of the Bush administration for 8 years of lies and gross incompetence.  Trump already forced Pelosi to impeach, but will they do more?
My biggest fear is Trump somehow pulling out a win in November.  My second biggest fear is Democrats not being willing to do enough to repair all the damage when they‚Äôre back in power.  I am a proud Democrat, but one thing I‚Äôll never forget or forgive is how they dealt with Bush.
You support and encourage the monster Trump.
Unfortunately, we have consistently seen Trump stomping our laws and the Constitution.  Constant Impunity and refusing to follow subpoenas &amp; ignoring Supreme Court directives. Trump lawsuits have been his tactics for years. No service done minimizing danger from Trump &amp; Co.

Actually sorry about this - he was one of the less toxic members of the Trump admin, and he had actually done some good in his life. But in the end, he got on the Trump Train, and it killed him. R.I.P.
Lol, anyone that agrees with Trump is a white supremacist? Let us also remember that Democrat cities are the ones being mismanaged - so much so that they let their own cities get burned to the ground. Sad that democrats have become what they are today!
Trump suggests delaying election amid fraud claims, but has no power to do so  Who didn‚Äôt see this coming? #ElectionDelay #DonaldTrump
Trump won‚Äôt go near his funeral. He would  not want to be associated with any reflection or reminder of his incompetence.  Next he‚Äôll say, ‚Äú I hardly knew the guy‚Äù.

I guess Pence can‚Äôt go to John Lewis funeral bc he‚Äôs a subservient toad ( and will be replaced on the ticket anyway as Trump only loyal to self)
This is sad. One line of thought is that he brought it on himself and endangered others. His, at best, naivete that led to his demise in a little over a month is still tragic. Responsible leadership from Donald Trump would go a long way to prevent unnecessary death

Before people freak out:  No, Trump can‚Äôt actually delay the election. Only an act of congress can.  He floats dumb shit like this literally all the time cuz he has the impulse control of a toddler.  He constitutionally HAS to leave office on January 20 without an election.
Let‚Äôs stop talking about Trump wanting to delay the election. He knows he can‚Äôt. We know he can‚Äôt.  He‚Äôs just trying to distract from the terrible economic numbers that came out today and the death count from the virus.,
Donald J Trump is trying to distract from the US GDP loss of 32.9%. He knows that he doesn't have the authority to change the date of the general election.
This is one of your crowning achievements. Like the 1,000‚Äôs of deaths, infrastructure, Trump Care and a 33% drop in our GDP.

The covid response was a total disaster for Trump. Instead of asserting himself as a strong leader who didn‚Äôt prescribe to the mob mentally he went along with the narrative from the shutdown imbeciles and lunatics. If anything is going to be his undoing it will be this.
Pogue is a Trump hater. Berenson must not have been a very good reporter  #hydroxychloriquineworks

If Trump calls Portland protesters a "beehive of terrorists" then what do we call his Cabinet???
I actually do get along with him. We just disagree on Trump. Thanks for your input, I feel like a much more fulfilled human being. Don't forget to inject bleach against COVID-19 and protect yourself at night from demon sex..
I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any evidence to support your claim that Trump wants to place black people below white people. There have been no actions or statements that support that. I was trying to go straight for WHY you would perceive things that way.
Don't believe this guy; he's as anti trump as they come. "Science" is trash when the analysis is designed to come out a certain way.  #hydroxichloroquine
save the USPS. Trump will defund until there is no mail at all.
Trump said that he could shoot somebody and they'd still support him. Well he didn't need a gun in this case.
The color of evil is putrid Orange to think a president could actually delay the elections is ridiculous? Trump you have no power to delay the election! It won't happen! You might try to sue 36 or 37 States when you lose to Joe Biden but it won't work! #dumpTrump
That reasoning never crossed Trump‚Äôs mind.
trump is the only person I hate
Pogue is an anti-trump with 100s of anti-trump tweets, including disparaging tweets about Sarah Sanders.  Which means his "analysis" has ZERO credibility. He has a clear agenda.  #Hydroxychloroquine
Here‚Äôs Herman Cain at Trump‚Äôs Tulsa Campaign Rally where he likely contracted COVID. No mask. No social distancing.  Stupidly following Donald Trump in denial of the virus... #TrumpKillsAmerica
He said it.   The most RIGGED ELECTION ever. Mr. Putin. Can you hear me??  Donald J. Trump is the most DISGUSTING excuse for a human and those who still support him.
Press: ‚ÄúNext, do the Alphabet!‚Äù Trump: ‚ÄúThere is something called an English alphabet. It‚Äôs a very very Patriotic, American Alphabet. Nobody‚Äôs seen anything like it before! In fact, I‚Äôm hearing China doesn‚Äôt even have ONE and we have like 3. 3 is small but not compared to 0.‚Äù

Remember Republicans were the ones who fought against every election integrity bill! Follow their money to Diabold who makes the voting machines. It all comes together as to WHY they are so terrified with mail in voting.they need to cheat to win. FUCK TRUMP

When does Trump keep asking where are the ballots they're mailing gonna go...to the voters duh..he's an idiot
I said memorializing not memorizing. But the whatabout trump supporters don‚Äôt read
#TheFive Good idea President Trump, if school stays closed, send parents the money so they can send their kids, to an open school!
Didn't work. Obama is going to be on the news more than trump. Also, Bush and Clinton.
Psst.....Trump wanted to leave Syria
Trump is high and clueless as to what McConnell has not done. He sat on this bill since MAY
#TheFive Yes President Trump,  we need kids back in school!!!
...and plus Dems bill sat on McConnell's desk since MAY! Trump is high!
Trump tone has definitely changed with these press conference..he finally gets the economy wont get better if the virus stay around
I thought usually it took grabbing them by the .........to get him off.  #tRump
Let him try. Maybe It‚Äôll keep him busy while the clock keeps ticking. Plus it‚Äôll keep him distracted from future Trump distractions. And they‚Äôre coming.

Trump Takes A Victory Lap Over Alarm Sparked By His Push To Postpone Election Day
Looks like Trump thinks all voters in Florida and Michigan and other states are all Democrats. He appears to be shooting himself in the foot. Republicans vote by mail too...right.

Yesterday trump was trying to scare people from black and brown people who could possibly move into their neighborhoods and lower their house prices, today he wanted to postpone the election and this is your message?
I rarely, if ever, swear in public, Twitter or Facebook. But I find myself swearing at the TV when GOP goons like Gym Jordan, Doug Collins, Mnuchin, Nunes, and, of course, their Idiot-in-Chief Trump open their mouths. No one else makes my blood boil as much as they do. üòñ üò°

Sorry, that makes no sense whatsoever. People die in pandemics, and b I'm sorry fur your loss. However, while Obama acted decisively to fight against H1N1, Trump has done the exact opposite. He has countered and maligned the very people he should have been listening to along.
One of my followers made a good point.  Trump was impeached, doesn‚Äôt that make it illegal to be re-elected?  Even if only the House impeached him it still stands. HE SHOULD NOT BE ON THE BALLO

Mad King Trump has finally latched onto an issue that his #MAGA base is sure to rally around: No election.
Trump is such a child. President Bush gave a eulogy at John Lewis‚Äòs funeral even though John Lewis didn‚Äôt go to Bush‚Äôs inauguration because of the Al Gore/BUSCH recount election. Trump didn‚Äôt even pay respects to Lewis when he was lying in state in the Capitol. Not presidential.
What more does McConnell want out of trump, he could make trump resign tomorrow and run with pence and haley, but this is the party of trump...they are all trump now.
Well almost 4 years in , we know Donald J Trump is not an elected official ! he was placed in office by the Russians. #DonaldTrumpIsIllegitimate
Trump doesn‚Äôt care if more of his voters vote by mail. Trump doesn‚Äôt care if vote by mail is popular. The best opportunity Republicans have to suppress the vote is by reducing the number of urban voting sites where voters can vote. That‚Äôs the plan!
First of all, Pomeo‚Äôs smirk aside, he‚Äôs clearly not in in ‚Äúthe joke‚Äù, secondly, didn‚Äôt Trump tell us recently he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt kid‚Äù?

You honestly believe there is no possibility of voter fraud with millions of ballots floating around?   What if GOP wins, are you still going to take that position?  Is this exactly why Trump is making these statements? To take away Left arguments of ‚Äúfraud‚Äù once he wins?  ü§≠ü§îüßê

All of those points he Trump wants to but the Dems won‚Äôt let him
Lewis showed nothing but contempt for President Trump, why should he bother?
So, so sad. Herman Cain contracted COVID-19 at Trump‚Äôs rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma where social distancing signs were removed by Trump campaign staffers and masks were not required. I hope you‚Äôre proud of yourself, Mr. President. Cain‚Äôs death was a result of YOUR negligence.
Republicans against Trump
Republican Voters against Trump. I believe she‚Äôs in Ohio.
History will remember Donald Trump in one way and one way only: as an accessory to the murder of tens of thousands of Americans. And amazing legacy
I don't think so loll trump is done
Thanks! I must assume, then, that you recognized the character played by Robert Duvall in that pic and the implied connection to my joke about Eric Trump, n'est ce pas? Hope you chuckled to yourself! üòé
I sense desperation in the air....your years as an enabler to Donald Trump are costing you.
Very apparent, Trump will never be called eulogize anyone....besides, will they let him out of prison to do it.
Think about this one. I have seen every past president be able to cite Bible verses like Obama did in today‚Äôs eulogy. But never once from Trump. What a fraud.
Your right it‚Äôs just disappointing to have Trump as our President
Obama‚Äôs eulogy was very inspiring. I miss a President who can deliver an inspirational message that is positive and filled with unity and hope. We lost something precious when we got saddled with Trump.
Thank you! He praised Trump 4 not making masks mandatory for the July 4th rally. He said (in caps): "people are fed up". He was a selfish pig. I save my sadness 4 the innocent pple who died because of them. The chickens have come home to roost! Ana is not rude just factual!
. is a partisan hack. And a Trump-sucking sycophant. And an asshole.
I want all trump administration gone ASAP and GOP. They are all scum. The ride has been very bad. Killing Americans should have been stopped. We stopped being USA. A lot of people need to lose their jobs in the next administration. FBI and CIA and generals. All at the top.
Thanks to Trump and his corrupt leadership for our country going through this terrible epidemic Virus! All Trump cares about is his real estate and his selfish needs to be against the Medical professionals that we have to unite as a country to get this Virus out! Trumpüëéü§•
Why not flip flop it would extend your demise. If you support trump you‚Äôre a racist.
Biden did not say that Trump will achieve it, Biden said that he would try. In in fact, thats what Trump said he wants to do. So you  were/are wrong.
Or goes to jail... Cain was a big boy. He, along w/ Trump &amp; the rest of the goons, have caused many innocent people to die. He praised Trump 4 not making masks mandatory for the July 4th rally &amp; said that "people are fed up" (in caps). They deleted it today.
doesn't care, he's a loyalist.  But he better be careful, those close to Trump are testing positive and now sadly dying. I do not know if DeSantis has any health issues other than being overweight. Maybe his  family can be of influence for his sake if not for ours
He needs flippers &amp; a Speedo!
Completely agree. But theres that filibuster rule, etc, plus each member of the senate would have to give a little speach abt why Trump is evil, etc.   Maybe they could do it faster. Obvi, it would be priority #1. Trump would be on lockdown!!  Lol
Have they heard Herman Cain just died because of trump virus??
Obama's jab at Trump gets standing ovation

We must stop trump and his enablers.  Their incompetence has set our country back decades!

DeSatan hitched his future to the wrong wagon.  He, the Tea Party faction of the GOP, and Trump are finished. Their ineptitude to govern, their refusal to listen to scientific experts have relegat3dmthem to history‚Äôs garbage heap.
Just got to wondering. Were there ‚ÄúWhite Voices for Trump‚Äù, or does Trump automatically speak for them? Also did any previous Presidents have Black/Latino Voices for them?
Never
Biden will almost certainly win Maine by double digits. U think there will be a lot of Collins/Biden voters? I‚Äôm more skeptical considering how much Collins is tied to trump.
WOW! what a service #JohnLewisMemorial . What I am curious to know is why Trump was not at the services? As a leader of this country he should have been there.

Today Trump suggested delaying the election. Obama was reinforcing John Lewis' belief "When you see something that is not right, you must do something," "Democracy is not a state. It is an act, and each generation must do its part."
And Trump voters are conservative, so what does that make him? Your claim was specious and an attempt to discredit the original point, which is that by and large Republicans and far right groups are the biggest pushers re: reopening/masks are ineffective/covid conspiracies.
I highly doubt that! This right here is what the Democratic Party has become. Vote them all out!  üá±üá∑TRUMP 2020üá±üá∑

U act like Biden hasn‚Äôt said that same thing on the campaign trail. He constantly compares Trump to Wallace and Bull Conor. I have proof if u need it.

Right, because when Lewis boycotted BOTH Bush's and Trump's inaugurationa he was working to bring people together?
You have to keep in mind that Trump's biggest supporters are Nazis &amp; white supremacists.  These people love his racism.  He's one of them.  Has anyone ever checked his closet for his white hood &amp; robe?
No it‚Äôs in the constitution that both houses must approve it first.  The spanish flu was worse more deaths it didn‚Äôt get postponed. Trump definitely cannot do it.

What we need to watch for is tRump stuffing the ballots with "random" bogus ballots...fake ballots for tRump and Biden....enough that the election can be declared invalid for both parties. tRump wants chaos, he declares martial law to "make sure the next election is fair + just"

Ok, have it your way, Trump is going to lose big league.
Trump talks about it so much, if he‚Äôs involved I don‚Äôt trust him to not corrupt the process. His desperation is going to encourage him to try everything and anything to stay in the whitehouse. How are we even in this predicament?
The most hypocritical irony involved in this issue is to hear Demtards scream and cry about Trump not accepting the election results this coming November. Let me ask this simple question. When has Crooked Hillary accepted the election? Yeah, just what I thought. She hasn't.

There's no evidence of that. Biden doesn't carry the baggage of Clinton. There's no evidence Trump has expanded his base at all. The polls in the states Trump won by ~ 1% or less, which is why he won, are polling much stronger for Biden than they were in 2016 for Clinton.

That is amazing. Obama told you to get used to a low GDP that the jobs were not coming back here. More people were on welfare during Obama than anytime in history. But you believe whatever you want to believe. He had 8 years to fix it Trump did it in two. He WILL do it again.
Thank goodness President Trump had our economy on so high a plateau so we would have some 'cushion' to fall on. Imagine if we were starting at the economy Obama left us with?

Trump hardly 'ignores' science but does place personal choice on par with the so-called science. Especially since the 'scientists' keep changing their minds on what people should wear and do. They were handing out masks for people to use but didn't force them on attendees.
2/ As such he often puts out 'floaters' which astounds you poll tested blabbermouths. Trump is right to question what effect illegal voting will have in this election since Dems are pulling out all the stops for the use of 'mail-in ballots', a clear path for voter fraud.

Everything you listed is on Democrats. Trump didn't order sick patients into nursing homes to kill off 60k elderly. Your Dem Governors did that. Trump didn't lock down the country your Dem Governors did that. But let's forget about facts shall we.
Yes we are all a bunch of racists. Just because we hate seeing what's happening in the black communities and want to help it. I guess you are ok with children being shot every weekend. Just because you call Trump a racist doesn't make him one. It is Dem propaganda.

Still defending trump. How‚Äôs that going for you?!?
I honestly don't think he will stay through Trump's second presidency.  Once the #ObamaGate indictments are well under way and gone to trial, he'll probably resign.  That work for you?
So you have been following the Durham probe, and Obama Gate. Did you know him, Biden, and his DOJ spied on President Trump? Oh about that. The Obama Crime Fanily is correct.
Again you're a typical low educated Democrat. You see, and Hear what you want. When challenged you can't Debate. Please don't ever say President Trump lies when you clearky tell Many. A hypocrite to the core.
I'm not gonna lie I figure one of them is gonna have to be martyred to the virus before ANY of them change. I wouldn't cry if it were Barr. Trump would.
Wrong again. Read President Trump words. Not your interpretation of it. Again the CNN version. He clearly stated at the rally The hoax was what's going on. The politicizing of the Virus. Not the Virus. You won't look it up. There's no difference.
Covid is Not a worry for the US. That's what the so called experts said.  Bro you hate Trump we get it. Think rationally.  Even for a minute.
How is the President Responsible for the dead? Is Obama Biden Responsible for H1 N1? Even with a vaccine 1000's die. Maybe we should Still hold them accountable? President Trump closed flights to China in Jan. Dems were briefed before that. Who, China, Fauchi said No worries.
Because the police unions spin the same narratives as the Trump administration.Thanks! Trump appreciates my expertise as well. With my tutelage he should be able to get Covid deaths back to zero, as he promised last spring.
The sickness and the problem. Why is trump connectted to this demon?

Wait, I thought he had a change of "tone".of course he had it during another bout where he used the racist nickname he gave COVID-19 so I guess we're not supposed to be surprised. Should call it what it is TRUMP VIRUS. Finally his name on something more lasting than a building.

When someone such as Donald Trump declares he is the king and sent by God to rule America, there is nothing anyone can do about it. So sad.
Even though Trump is partly to blame for a lot of his base refusing to wear masks, this was a choice. Just like his base, if they want to deny it‚Äôs happening, they‚Äôre free to choose- but not free of the consequences of that choice.
Millions and millions too few to have an impact on what is right though. Trump is simply in desperation.

First, I didn‚Äôt reply to you. I didn‚Äôt care about your comment. My reply was expanding on the thoughts I shared. It‚Äôs MY thread, you jumped in. Don‚Äôt like what you see? Move on.  Trump is clueless about our government. When he does something stupid, he will be called out for it.
How about you get serious and hold the negligent president of your party responsible. It didn't have to be this way but trump failed to act.
On the contrary, coming from Trump it‚Äôs most certainly a BAD idea. He‚Äôs a failed business speculator who decided to play politics. Now a failed politician bringing the same bad ideas to our country. With the same results. Bankrupting America. #SupremeLoser  It‚Äôs his desperation.
Not many of them were doing their jobs when it mattered - when the US was endangered by a man such as Trump.  So, not many of them knew or understand what their job really is. They think it's being an "entertainment reporter" I would guess.

Trump floats unprecedented idea of delaying election, which he cannot do

However, I *will* add this: Trump is quickly killing more of his base than he is the Never Trumpers or the Democrats!  There is a reason to hope.

I‚Äôve thought so as well. He started by sending plants into protests. There‚Äôs a warrant out for white supremacist they believe started some of the violence in protests, another well known far right was on video at Portland dressed like ‚Äúantifa‚Äù Trump is aTraitor to our democracy!
#NobodyLikesTrump  #TrumpIsARacist  If anyone is doubtful that Trump is an anti-American, THIS proves it.  It sounds so much more "official" than saying "we can't shoot the poverty away, but you don't have to share your space with it". It worked for them before.
Shame on you  for spreading his nonsensical distraction.  GOP has promoted mail-in voting for years. Change your damn headline. He's losing and desperate. He's creating chaos. You're helping him.  via
"Down in polls, and on a day a major campaign supporter who advertised (&amp; attended) his maskless-Tulsa rally dies, Trump floats delaying election, which he cannot do."  How's THAT,
Trump could care less. All he cares about is crowd size. An empty shell of a man.
Imagine DYING for Donald Trump? üòü
Herman Cain was a POC so most MAGAts will not care about his passing. They'll say Cain was faking his right-wing positions all these decades in order to - one day - bring down Trump with his death.
Trump floats November election delay ‚Äî but he can‚Äôt do that, per the Constitution
Eventually‚Ä¶  it will go away.   Trump will succeed at something, eventually.
Herman Cain's death is another harsh blow. His own supporter, flaunting the CDC and Dr. Fauci's precautions, dies after contracting COVID-19 (possibly) during attendance at his less than stellar Tulsa Rally. While we all should mourn the loss of life, Trump knows this shows 4/
to attend. There's one spotlight gone from his orange complexion. The next is the GDP news. Trump cannot stand to be held accountable for his abysmal record as President and nothing is a harder pill for this 'successful businessman' than eating numbers like those.  3/
Today is July 30, 2020 and Trump has A LOT of fires to put out and there are many reasons that the spotlight isn't on him casting him a rosy glow. That's why tweeted the diversionary tweet about delaying the election. Let's take a look at everything (that I can see so far) 1/
The peak of trumps corruption that the spineless GOP will support. trump is dangerous scum. #VoteTrumpOut
For all that denial and reelection driven policy of ‚Äôeconomy over people‚Äô that Trump advocates joined in, there is a consequence. How many have been infected?  Herman Cain has had the ultimate consequence. Are you willing to make that sacrifice for Trump? #TrumpLiesPeopleDie
I know.  We're all burying friends and family now (I've lost 17 people I knew closely OR family members).  I will remember their names - each of them - when I vote Trump out in November, and JUDGE  members afterwards.
thank you for your voice. I wish more republicans would speak up. Why are they so afraid of trump? You are not.
Guess in retrospect going maskless to Trump's Tulsa rally wasn't a very good idea. Thoughts and prayers.
Trump floats November election delay - but he can‚Äôt do that #SmartNews
Blood on Trump‚Äôs hands.
Will Trump even attend the funeral??
Wondering if Herman Cain's beneficiaries/estate is bound by any contract (NDA) Cain signed w/Trump.
Even as DeSantis tries to dodge this debate so as not to be out of step with his mentor, President Donald Trump, he almost seems to be making the case for continued federal benefits.
Also: EVEN IF the election is delayed for some reason, Trump does NOT stay in office past January 20th. The Constitution puts the Speaker of the House in charge if there is no elected President or VP (as President) fulfilling his/her term in office.
Y'all may want to point out this: EVEN IF the election is delayed for some reason, Trump does NOT stay in office past January. The Constitution puts the Speaker of the House in charge if there is no elected President or VP (as President) fulfilling his/her term in office.
Hey Varney You Posted This #3DayzzzAgo &amp; Then President TRUMP ReTweeted This &amp; This Did NOT Crash The Stock Market On That Day!
Hell No... The main thing that is INNACURATE &amp; FRAUDULENT in our once great country is Donald J. Trump. We cannot survive another 4 years of his lies and racist ways! #TrumpIsARacist  #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020
üëç Woke. From my tweet‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúOnly Congress could alter the federal statute on when states appoint their electors. #TrumpIsClueless  More indication that Trump is desperate. #TrumpResignNow‚Äù
"Pulling the country back to normal" was NEVER Trump's election pitch. Never!
Of course, it‚Äôs not something Trump can do. Even more, I‚Äôd bet his campaign and aides are not happy that he tweeted this. Foremost, it‚Äôs a clear sign of desperation. It‚Äôs his delusional mind looking for any way out. The economy is NOT getting better. He‚Äôs utterly failed COVID19.
If Congress postponed the date of the election, they could not do so indefinitely. The Constitution's 20th Amendment establishes an end date for the presidential term - noon 1/20/2021. So unless he is duly re-elected before then, Trump is out of a job on that date.
This moron is the sickest crybaby I‚Äôve ever come across! What a LOSER!!
Lol a pastor lying like Trump ...smh you should be ashamed of yourself
Exactly , not enough time and Nancy Pelosi would be acting POTUS ,  typical Trump , not reading how this all can pan out
Trump is just sounding off because he will loose overwhelmingly and be embarrassed. He is scared you know, it‚Äôs that reality thing he can‚Äôt face. Poor Delusional Donnie.
Interesting . If Congress postponed the date of the election, they could not do so indefinitely. The Constitution's 20th Amendment establishes an end date for the presidential term - noon 1/20/2021. So unless he is duly re-elected before then, Trump is out of a job on that date.
And would it not be great for President Biden say, ‚ÄúMr Trump, tear down this wall!‚Äù?
We can only hope that,unlike Trump, those in the Military will honor their oaths. I believe they will but Trump and Barr will do everything they can to keep him in power, The People and The Constitution be damned.
Trump suggests delaying the election over mail-in voting - Business Insider #Election2020  Only Congress could alter the federal statute on when states appoint their electors. #TrumpIsClueless  More indication that Trump is desperate. #TrumpResignNow
Benched bitter loser  pulled his celebration of United States birthday down.  He got benched and like a nine year old, threw a tantrum.

benched, takes revenge on the  and Americans...like a comic book villian. Except,  Little Kaepernick is winning...
There's the golden phrase we all knew was incoming.   "Delay the election"  I have heard countless Trump supporters say "If you can go to Walmart, it's safe to go vote"  Shut up Donnie. Face the polls like every incumbent has had to.
The democrats were disgusting. Terrified that Trump is winning!!!
Americans looking at that "Election winner is not Trump or Biden" market.
S Miller should read this to trump. Perhaps melania could read the Constitution to trump as a bedtime story.
S Miller needs to read this tweet to trump. Again, trump needs to read the Constitution. Perhaps melania can read it to him as a bedtime story.
Dear  ,  How to get the Left to vote Dem for 2024:  1) Don't rig your Primary Election  2) Support a Progressive Platform instead of a Corporate one.  3) Actually oppose Donald Trump during his 2nd Term instead of funding everything he wants.
Until Trump can securely steal the election
The worst in history. Trump set a real historical record
Three more months until we vote him out. Federal employees that want to keep their jobs will stop following Trump‚Äôs increasingly dangerous orders. He‚Äôll still be dangerous until January but he‚Äôll have fewer enablers
Trump has a droopy eye and is dragging his foot. Both on the same side. Strokes?

flushed "The Rules" with him &amp;  1/5/2017 chaos meeting. I bet  has a SCOTUS nominee vetted &amp; sitting teed up this very second.
Trump's election already did that.
Think back to Ferguson riot; what did Obummer do? So, leave President Trump alone; he has shown much restraint.
Buck up,  AG Maura Healy will be inventing nonsense charges to stop you from stopping #COVID19 before November 4th... Non-citizens have never determined Congressional seats.
Trump won't lose so prepare for one hell of a war when they lose again. Protect the children by all means necessary.
Trump should go into stand up comedy after his Presidency. I genuinely laughed out loud from the sister comment ü§£ü§£ü§£
So if #DementiaJoe wins, January 5th, 2021, Cult45 renditions Hunter Biden to Ukraine or Arkansas, which is it?
Thankful that aside from the dregs like Trump, the are many people truly concerned about others, dedicating their lives to help.  #FauciIsAHero
Indeed. Gives a nutshell of how pathetic and petty Trump is.
To simplify, he‚Äôs ‚ÄòTrump‚Äô ‚Äî forever synonymous with the absolute depths of scum.
Like everything else. Trump is so steeped in delusion he no longer has any grasp on reality.
I live in a rural area and feel like the #RacistInChief Trump can tweet about the suburbs I can as well. No one should be denied the right to build or live where they choose. #SuburbsForBiden is trending let's keep it going!
Trump finds annoyance in the most insignificant issues, everything actually. No wonder he‚Äôs such s miserable person.
Thanks for the mention Amy! Definitely understand the frustration. I‚Äôm motivating myself by counting down the days till November 3rd. I was counting the weeks but now it‚Äôs just 96 days. Then I imagine how Trump will be crushed by defeat.

Trump is a con man. Fixed it!
Who, what, when, where? Poor old Joe! I wonder who's padding his wife and son's wallets! She should be ashamed of herself letting her husband run in the campaign after all he's going through. I know that is irritating President Trump; he likes competition.
I haven't been seeing Trump ad's in Florida either
This may be part of the reason Trump was elected. Democrats probably mistook Trump for Hillary Clinton.
Hey Rick, i hear Trump doesn't like potatoes dumped on his head.

No, wait, he might be right.  Trump was to blame too.

Your president is the only one with the balls to stand up to other countries and look out for our country‚Äôs best intrest. I suppose you would rather have life long politicians continue to destroy and sell out this Country for their own financial gain. Thank you President Trump!
Fearless till Trump is gone, forever!!
#BabyTantrum Trump walks out of briefing after CNN question
Josh, I don‚Äôt get it. I heard from a lot of friends that they hated (and still hate HRC). And these aren‚Äôt hard core MAGA types, they‚Äôre professionals (both men and women) who can‚Äôt stand her. And as bad as Trump is today, they‚Äôd still vote for him over her.
There will be no need for low income housing! Let the reset begin! Thank you President Trump for all your hard work for the people. WWG1WGA
Because Trump mentioned it when COVID first started and said it was worth looking into since then it is nonstop Dems blasting the drug because he said that What if it did really help WE WILL NEVER KNOW,, how come all the homeless people aren‚Äôt dying
Yesss 2020 we love reinforcing segregation just like the housing and project development did thank you Trump you have successfully regressed us as a nation beyond what you promised ü•∞ü•∞
#RonDesantisFailedFlorida for his love of trump. Trump can‚Äôt save him from going down in history as the man who killed his state. #DeathSantis. Someday you will be held accountable.

There's no adequate testing anywhere in the United States.  Thanks fucking trump
Swan killed it, good questions, Trump is a putt and a Russian agent. That we can be clear of now.
Correct... But Trump's move goes against his military advisers.  Tbh Germany is more than capable to defend itself. Still, moving such troops out weakens the alliance.

It's coincidental to the book imo....I think Trump is showing his contempt of China because of what they did with the COVERT19....yes I spelled it that way because it was another one of their sneaky plans to bring down America...
Trump clowns always use ‚Äúthey.‚Äù
Nope, a vote for Trump is a vote for Trump. Biden still has to earn every vote no matter how terrible trump has been. Trump + Johnson actually defeated Clinton + Stein in the popular vote.

Republicans used to love absentee ballots because many of their voters are invalids and shut-ins and cant get to the polls. Trump is pulling this conspiracy out of his asshole.

Don‚Äôt bother there won‚Äôt be an election on November 3. Mark my words Trump will announce NESARA On November 2, after-which a presidential and all of Congress election must be held 120 days after NESARA announcement.   Trump gets a brand new Congress &amp; exposes mail in voter fraud!

Will, have you read any articles by Matt Taibbi?  The hatred of Trump has unfortunately changed the media.  They only care about one thing- electing Biden.
Trump will never have a plan regarding the virus or unemployed starving Americans. His election and political power is first and foremost, always has been. May he rot in hell

This is a humongous deal. I know this industry - well.   The pharmaceutical industry is as corrupt as Satan himself.   Trump cannot deal with Satan so he had to find a company that would produce in America that‚Äôs not corrupt.  Bravo President Trump I‚Äôm so proud of you! God bless!

Democrats cannot allow the Pentagon wish list to stay in this bill either. To try to replace the money taken for Trump's stupid wall in this bill is disgraceful.

In all things relating to President Trump there is one line in the Old Testament, Wisdom, chapter 2, to remember: "For their own malice blinded them." (Note: "Wisdom" is in Catholic Bibles - you will not find it in King James Versions.)
I for one remember President Trump taking early and decisive action  against Covid-19  by blocking travel to and from China.  And the Democrats in general and Joe Biden in particular called him a Xenophobe and tried to keep travel open.  That tells you what they wanted .

When Trump successfully stops black people from moving to the suburbs, I wonder if he can do something about all the white people that keep moving into my mostly black neighborhood. Everytime I look around more  white people are become my  neighbors. They are peaceful though.
Dude you‚Äôre so lost, it‚Äôs not even worth replying to you. Trump has been the toughest president on China. Biden and Obama worshiped China and allowed them to get away with everything and guess what? They profited from it. You need to educate yourself before commenting

Obsession with crime and punishment.  The left wants to defund the police and do direct harm to the cops. They are REMOVING police. Trump passed prison reform  No.   We arent obsessed.
6. Controlled mass media. Perhaps. But. It by Trump. By the LEFT. THEY deplatform. THEY censor. THEY refuse to offer a balanced perspective   Not happening - at least not by Trump.
4. Supremacy of the Military - the Left goes on and on anour generals who hate Trump. Every time a Republican gets in office they must repair the mess the Democrat who preceded them did to the military. They aren‚Äôt ‚Äúsupreme‚Äù just offered a bit of respect.
150,000 Dead Americans = 37,500 Trump Benghazi's.  No number of dead Americans is high enough to make Trump care.  #coronavirus  #COVID19

I‚Äôm a Democrat. I hold the opinion that Atty. Gen. Barr has acted only in the interest of Trump and his cronies. I think he is corrupt. But this hearing is awful. Dems can be deservedly critical of Barr but to invite a witness and then not even let him answer questions is wrong.
Absolutely, I am in raged by these DemocRATS they R disgusting and rudest Thugs I have ever seen in Congress,trying to degrade Barr n Trump

Oh Gary. This is pathetic. Perhaps you might want to gaze over the news the last 55 days in Portland. Or other cities where, up until just recently, no federal response occurred. These are leftists, like you, who‚Äôve been rioting. They hate the US. They hate Trump.

President Trump said putting a bottle rocket up your ass and igniting it was good. They would be doing it just to spite him period.
I knew it was something along those lines. Their body language was undeniable off. White extremist hiding in  camouflage fatigue looking like the fools that they are. Betsey, her brother and trump are despicable human beings. They are above the law!
Hallelujah We need schools open We need Businesses open and We need to Vote out DemocRATS and take back House Keep the Senate and Trump
I didn‚Äôt know Trump was a doctor??
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Wow. Wear that w pride! Now that donald "Lone Ranger" trump wears his w pride, as all patriots do. And he is, by his own words, "the most patriotic person in the world". Just glad you are wearing mask, like potus.

Powerful video..  Putin is really a dictator.  Donald trump is a traitor, a nobody, a disgrace, a loser. Worse president ever!
Hundreds of Feds poured into Chicago as part of¬†Trump's "Operation Legend," aimed at tackling¬†violent crime and gun offenses.  Mayor Lightfoot initially resisted the initiative, but later said Trump has her support, as her city struggles with gun violence.

Trump's sending fed LE to cities that are violent, out of control &amp; lawless. Not his fault EVERY liberal city is a lawless cesspool; that's on you &amp; the other feckless, useless, activists, pretending to be pol "leaders." If you did your jobs the feds wouldn't need to come into
Jeff, we love Amazon. Trumps hates you. We need you Nov3rd. Help us defeat trump! You may be helping the Dems now. If so thank you. Strengthen the Post Office. Vote by Mail is going to be paramount... üåäüåä
"Keep it peaceful"? When were these radical, anarchist riots EVER peaceful? They're not abt peace, they're about violence &amp; destruction. They're protesting NOTHING, they just want to destroy the ctry. Trump had no choice but to send feds, you feckless, Leftist pols are useless.
Everything trump touches is criminal. WE CAN SEE YOU DUMMIES.
Of course. If you don‚Äôt vote Biden, you‚Äôre voting for trump.
Bring tears to my eyes.. My Beloved cousin fought in the Vietnam War. He got agent orange and died a cruel death. My husband served in the war. Fucking trump has no respect for our Service men. He's got bounties on their heads..
We thank you for your services.. trump and putin put Bounties on the heads of our troops. trump spoke to putin 7 times since March. Trump's a traitor to our country. Don't let trump  kill us all.
Trump's Illness, Injury &amp; Death Count.  I have no doubt these #s are low...  Dead: ~38 Immigrants in ICE detention ~148,000 Americans  ~14+ Dead Soldiers w Bounties Paid Covid Illness: ~Minimum 4M - more w EPA rollbacks Injury: ~Countless PEACEFUL Protesters #TrumpsAMurderer
If you are a right wing Republican and Megan is leading your charge on the View, your Party even without Trump is in Trouble!

Yes! It makes no sense. If they are not happy with Trump, it is till a vote for him if they don‚Äôt vote for Biden.
Like you can‚Äôt vocalize your concern for child sex trafficking, while ignoring that Trump also had a deep relationship with Epstein, and documents regarding that are leaked. Like what is this cognitive dissonance?

The prescription drug thing Trump did today. By lowering drug prices helps all Americans. I don't understand why it's not being reported more. It's historic.
Biden should ease up on that Trump is a racist stuff. Has shown a number of instances of being a racist. At some point Trump is going to throw that in his face. Then you know what he'll do, he'll lie. That's what liberal Democrats do they lie.

Any idea which news item Trump is trying to obscure with the stupid bullshit about election delays?  1. 32.9% economic contraction  2. Swann interview on Russian bounties 3. John Lewis funeral  My guess is the funeral. He views his absence as a slight, and the attendees a threat.
Shocking. Sobering. Is that what President Trump meant by American carnage?
Based on his post-Trump verbal diarrhea, I have serious doubts about how sincerely "pro-life" French is or has been. I suspect he saw it merely as another opportunity to grift, as so many of his NT pals have demonstrated how they saw it.
Delay of the election is the only way for sure, 100%, that Donald Trump isn‚Äôt President past 1/20/2021. He‚Äôs bluffing. I call.

Stunning.  This fool has repeatedly sided with Russia against the US and his supporters, for some batcrap ignorant reason, think he is patriotic.  Trump sells out our military.  Period.
I put up articles about this last week.  They insinuated trump had pushed his hotel in DC and the FBI bldg all along since his administration began.  It has been in the news over the years many times.  And he was told to knock off the crap by investigators.  But here it is again!
They all bought stock in it especially Trump.
trump halted briefings after he told people to inject bleach and put a light inside their bodies to stop covid.  Now he is promoting alien DNA, incubus and succubus, don't wear a mask, there is a cure, demon sperm, sex with demons lady.  Why did the R Senate conspire to keep him?
I think they have said that, several times, loud and clear.  They want every single trump enabler gone.    That is their mission and they are proud of it.
The ‚ÄúKnight‚Äù is right! Electing Biden to replace Trump is a political farce. We‚Äôll wake up the very next morning like Murray in ‚ÄúGroundhog Day‚Äù. Many who voted for Trump, did it out of frustration and to flip the bird to the Washingtonian Oligarchs and their apparatchik.

Idiot,Trump did not create virus. China did. He didn't cause any deaths. Half of the deaths are fault of Cuomo &amp; his failure in the nursing homes. Many more would be dead had it not been for Trump's quick actions. Trump's done an amazing job! And fyi..those numbers are skewed.

Here in Florida, everybody I talk to including myself will vote for Trump in November.
They can try setting the table for #trump, but Nancy Pelosi is still Speaker of the #PeoplesHouse. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
Trump isn‚Äôt so much worried about losing than what happens to him when he loses. He is afraid of jail and rightfully so.  Also members of the family and those who use the ‚Äújust taking orders‚Äù defense should be worried too.
It's going to sting this fake news broke paper like the st pete times when President Trump wins.
The Chart shows black employment, not GDP. As a measure of economic growth, I agree that Trump‚Äôs growth is good. However, the conversation. The real median and per capita GDP of the black community has flatlined under this administration.
There WAS a superspreader in TULSA...  THE 8 Trump CAMPAIGN workers cited in most articles Tested positive... Well before the rally  And OK GOV says he thinks He Contracted before the rally As well but would have been pre contagious AT THE RALLY  SOUNDS like a known source
It would take congress (both houses) passing legislation to delay the election. It‚Äôd take a constitutional amendment to keep Trump in office past noon EST 1/20/2021
Simple - Trump killed Mr Cain by not taking the precautions health professionals warned him of. Trump also had his goons go around the arena taking signs that told people attending to distance.
Multiple felonies?  Fighting back is not a felony  And WHY do you continue to excuse the violence of the MOSTLY PEACEFUL protestors...  Is PARTLY VIOLENT so very acceptable for someone just because they express YOUR PARTY PREFERENCE  (This is YOUR QUESTION... alt-RIGHT BACK AT U)
That is a satire site. Regis did not leave any money to the Trump campaign..
Umm, I learned about trump re-tweeting this doctor's claims from MSNBC.  They refused to show the clip, as its contents were DANGEROUS, and never once mentioned the doctor was black.    How do you have a blue check?  Who are you with this nonsense?
Hope Trump had jam in his pocket because he's toasted with that kind of news
Well said Steve. I hope the Trump base can be open minded enough to see what's happening in this country. I've been "not so nice" with regards to Trumpers, but I sincerely hope they can absorb the current state of this country and make better choices.
Herman Cain will be missed...  If he caught coronavirus AT A rally Will most probably be impossible to prove or disprove forever...  But WE WILL always remember that At the rally...he was telling Americans we cannot be immobilized by FEAR... AND  Continue to be FREE AMERICANS ‚ù§
If the REAL JOURNALIST stop jumping at his commands that will drive him crazy &amp; help us from hearing the same crap üí© from his lying Press Secretary &amp; Trump
John Lewis boycotted Trump‚Äôs inauguration and said he did not believe Trump was the legitimate winner. Why would Trump attend his funeral?  If he did so y‚Äôall would be bitchin about that too.
When you all get off the Trump tit then I‚Äôll follow you again as I agree with a lot of your points.   But I will not caucus with fascists and racists who cannot and will not deliver the reforms needed to fix this issue.
That's a lie. Biden has committed to 3 debates. Also, tRump stumbles every time he speaks in public. His grammar is atrocious. You must not pay too much attention to him when he speaks.
That's *exactly* what Trump is doing.  Remember: for 3.5 years, he has explicitly undone, overridden, struck down, and otherwise destroyed much of what Obama worked on, created, and built. He's not done yet.
Actually, I do not. Flatlining numbers show stagnation. Trump could not continue the growth and the proof is in the numbers. If you look at them.
The tweet from President Trump, who's trailing in nearly every national poll for the Nov. 3 election, came on the same morning as the U.S. reported an economic contraction of 9.5 percent in the second quarter of 2020, an unprecedented recession.
They told me there would not be math, but is that rate Lower or higher than the number of tRump appointees who have broken the Hatch Act or have been indicted
U.S. Sen.  of Florida said, emphatically, that Election Day won‚Äôt be delayed.   The president‚Äôs suggestion is essentially impossible both logistically and legally:
Second, have you ever actually look at the income numbers? There‚Äôs been a flatline in black income since Trump.   Source: Brookings Instittute.
When asked,  said he hadn't seen  tweet.   He then explained Florida is working hard to ready itself for a Nov. 3 election:

What garbage. Herman Cain failed America, not the other way around. In campaigning for Trump, he helped sign a death warrant for well over 160,000 Americans, most of whom were innocent. Loyal Americans tried to stop him, which would have saved Cain's life.
To bad trump is complicit in his death
I am sorry for the loss of your friend &amp; former boss. I mean that. I'm also sad for Mr. Cain's family. I know that grief too well. It hurts. I'd never say anyone deserved to contract a disease &amp; die. I *will* say I wish he, &amp; many others, had listened to science instead of Trump.

Thanks  to trump he is no longer with us
It's in the Constitution that Trump can't accept foreign emoluments - like he does every minute of every day.  It's in the Constitution that the People have the right to peacefully protest - and Trump violates that right daily.  Marco &amp; every Republican will back Trump. Be afraid
Trump has accomplished exactly what he was hoping for by starting an argument about the credibility of the the election. *Because he‚Äôs losing - if he was ahead in the polls it would be full steam ahead. #Election2020
Trump has had 4 years to prove himself. He doesn't get extra time to salvage this dumpster fire of a presidency by delaying the election. That's not how this works. #WeWillVote November 3rd.

Wouldn't it require a law passed thru both chambers? If so Dems can just not bring up any bill proposed in Senate. Dare tRump to use an executive order, then off to Supreme Court. I can't see the Supremes going along with this. Otherwise there is nothing Dems can do.

I love how trump wants to delay elections but doesn‚Äôt want to delay schools for k-12. What an asshole.

Too bad he died from trump's negligence
when You get the cold or skin your knee - do you blame Trump as well?  Traffic issues - blame Trump.  Some people just have to hate.
I agree. The Democrats dislike Trump so much it's shocking that they couldn't come up with a fabulous candidate. Congress needs term limits because they all get out of touch with reality.
I just gave it to you...his own sons admitted they have gotten millions in loans from the Russians. Trump himself has talked up Putin for years now.
Racial propaganda from that video clip would make me think the black population in MT rose by 5000% overnight. The same b.s. Trump did against Biden with the old lady on a 4 hour hold with 911 while her house was being broken into. Tap into white fear. Smh.

Remember President Trump never loses. He has Mar a Lago and Trump Tower. We lose though if he loses.
President Trump will win easily.
And now he is DEAD. Because of your boss...and his lies. You are also to blame as you are his mouthpiece to the press and push the constant lies that he spews from his mouth. How will explain that to your child when they learn about Trump and you in history class?
For all the hatred that Herman Cain directed towards the gay community I cannot say FUCK YOU AND GOOD RIDDANCE loud enough. Our country is a better place today because he‚Äôs dead. And he caught COVID at a Trump rally! üòÇ Made my day. Love, Tom in St. Pete.
Listening to the speeches and historical memories at the funeral of the great John Lewis makes me yearn for a smart, intelligent, knowledgeable, sympathetic leader for this country. Trump could never understand or care.

RIP Mr. Cain. You didn't have to die for Trump.
‚ÄúHe asked for the election to be delayed?‚Äù DeSantis asked.
Trump's tweet came on the same day the economy was reported to have shrunken 9.5 percent in the second quarter.
It's not "a political statement" to point to objective, provable truths:  ‚úÖFACT: Cain died of COVID ‚úÖFACT: &amp; was at the crowded Tulsa rally ‚úÖFACT: he denounced masks &amp; other safety recommendations ‚úÖ FACT: Trump mocked distancing guides &amp; minimal precautions &amp; had them removed
Im okay with Trump but delaying the election is not necessary
It was an SNL skit...funny when they do them about Trump they don't laugh and get butthurt.
Get a trump toe tag at every rally
Abortion party? You know how many republican women have abortions? More than you think. Btw Trump could care less about abortion he was told he had to be pro life to run as a republican. He's a pathological lying dolt.
my dad commented on a FB post I shared re: Trump threatening to change election days saying that he‚Äôs TROLLING us and that I fell for it... uh, a sitting president shouldn‚Äôt be doing that?? like at all?

Does anyone really care what Trump has to say today?  We already know whatever he says will be either a lie or nonsensical drivel.  Please, press, do not repeat every asinine word he utters.  Give the public a break! Report real news and not his idiotic ramblings.
When President Trump is re-elected it will be a lessen to some and a not others. Strength, alpha male, height and charisma over ride billions of dollars of  swamp money and snowflake feelings.
President Trump is a boss.
My two cents: The point of Trump's tweet is not to actually delay the election, but merely another in a relentless series of attacks to suggest the potential results will be illegitimate.
I watched the tech hearings, found it interesting. The main reason its not getting more publicity is because of the timing. 2020 there are so many issues/big stories in America now. From what‚Äôs going on in Portland to COVID-19 to as usual Trump etc. In 2019 it get more coverage.

Putin orders Trump to remove U.S. troops from Germany to strengthen Putin and weaken US, Trump follows Putin's orders, and Marco &amp; every elected Republican supports this treason against US. Why does Marco hate America? Shouldn't his betrayal be punished?

Trump's decision to move troops from Germany slammed as 'a gift to Putin' - CNNPolitics
Knowing trump's (and this administration's) pathology, do you think he'll attempt to send in more saboteurs to make the city look even more "lawless" without the troops there? I'm worried and don't trust anything they do.
Doesn't mean it was that drug that helped her...but hey you keep letting Trump shove that crap down your throat because he won't admit he was wrong and you all defend his stupidity. Btw just because his dead uncle went to MIT doesn't make him smart too.
What's going to be really embarrassing when election day shows the rest of the world that 43% of the nation is racist enough to support Trump. Why would any tourist want to visit the US even if Trump loses, especially the way he has racists attacking people openly?

Trump will say anything at this point, completely unbelievable
If you see Trump in 20 years, that's means you went to hell
With #TrumpCrimeFamily in prison there will be great #lowincomehousing available in former #Trump properties.
Trump is desperately trying to give his own children the wealth his father left him and it is driving him insane. Period.  Full stop.
This next election is going to show the rest of the world precisely how many Americans are that racist and it is going to be pretty embarrassing when it comes in at 43%. Why would anyone want to come here? Especially when Trump has them attacking people for no reason.

I think Trump's "extinction event" is a little bit bigger. How many US dead by Jan 20? 300k? 400k? But yes the "reptilian aliens run the govt" may be onto something.

When I read the comments on Trump's tweets I continue to be dismayed by the level of ignorance in Merica.  I should have acclimated by now.
Just wow . It's an effort by the right to make the Real story a hoax.  It's the White House new strategy  That's why Trump is now pushing  that narrative.
I don't know why l wrote that this is going to be President TRUMP'S LAST TERM IN OFFICE. It just came out. I am not always right.
Who was the guy who served before trump because for some reason I can‚Äôt remember I bet it‚Äôs cause he didn‚Äôt do anything good for us but that could just be me forgetting
President Trump announced it!
Bill Barr is an utter embarassment to the United States of America.  An incompetant toady to Donald Trump.

I‚Äôve never seen a press corp so disrespectful of any U.S. President - personal feelings aside. The professionalism of CNN‚Äôs reporters is NOT dependent on how President Trump carries himself. It‚Äôs still the office of the president &amp; your people should treat it w/respect...

Do you think if Trump were forced to take the citizenship test, he would fail? I could make a wager now saying he doesn't even get a 25/100. He probably couldn't even list all our founding fathers to save his life!
It‚Äôs all scripted.  He‚Äôs picking the reporters of a piece of paper.  Good luck debating Trump!  Biden‚Äôs team is going to do everything they can to get out of it.

I guarantee Bill Barr agrees with Trump
I was for 3 months before election. Lasted 3 months later, most of that was by phone because it became so contentious. My final statement to him was tRump could enter your house, crap in your sink, you would find a reason for him doing that plus think it was the best thing ever
Right--he, like Trump, never lies, never does anything wrong, and is not partisan at all in his duties. I see you all are fine giving up 1st Amendment rights cos it's the Left getting gassed, beaten, assaulted while unarmed and peaceably protesting. Got it.
When you talk about people you don‚Äôt put them all in one bunch I define a magat as a magat a fool that does as trump says and republicans are not all magats

I didn't see the Donald Trump Jr video, but if it did in fact contain misinformation about COVID, then his account got what it deserved.
My apologies! Yes, we need more testing. The CDC fell into disarray over the past 20 years, and Trump has finished the job, making them write guidelines according to his political whims.
Don‚Äôt you think Trump has hired people to deface BLACK LIVES MATTER? We do know he is a complete racist.
Right--you voted for NO Evidence, NO witnesses. You put Trump over country. Shame on you.

on responding to COVID: Up to the states to respond.  Also Trump on protests: Damn graffiti.  Send the troops &amp; mercenaries in NOW! Can't leave it to the locals.
To defeat Trump plan you move the protest away from the Fed Bldg. Go to a park. Trump army will follow the protesters  and show their hand. Or his army will stay and look stupid. Take away their reason for being there. Use this tactic for the next 99 days.
Yeah  It's "almost" haha like the DNC is purposely ignoring the millions of people screaming for real change.  These Veep picks...wtf  And Their down votes on #MedicareForAll probably just gave trump 4 more years.  Oh well... There's always Portugal... Or Costa Rica  üòî
Trump is setting the stage to cancel the elections. Needs about 3-5 more cities to show protestors against his army. Will call martial law. Postpone the elections. More protest and more confrontations arise. But he will still be President. Take it to the courts? Tie it up 4 years
It's "almost" haha like the DNC is purposely ignoring the millions of people screaming for real change.  Their down votes on #MedicareForAll probably just gave trump 4 more years.  Oh well... There's always Portugal... Or Costa Rica  üòî

Have you ever stopped to think that‚Äôs what trump has you doing?
This guy is being dragged to more places than John McCain was. Lewis voiced hatred for Donald Trump when he was alive, so paying respects to him would be hypocritical. Good call, Mr. President.
IF he said real slanderous things, Trump would sue him.  Did not happen. He said he would sue the 26 women who say he sexually assaulted them. Never happened. Anyway, when a book like that comes out, it gets debunked piece by piece. I've seen none of that.
One thing people say about Bolton is he does not lie. I've seen nothing in his book proved wrong, have you? Do you think Trump would not have said that?
Trump said the concentration camps were ok!
We've been saying it for a while now, this is just irresponsible. We're still waiting to hear from  if he thinks  plan is still working. #FL18 #FlaPol

There's meanness and extremist on both sides. You would think we would be further along though. We have the access to education and technology, we should not be where we are. Trump and the Republican party should not have been able to do so much damage in such a short time.

#2) USA Trump policy is to weaken Russian influence and economy by disrupting their primary source of income... Oil &amp; Gas.  Trump is 1st President to export our abundant natural gas overseas... and specifically to Poland. Poland 'was' dependent on gas from Russia.  Not anymore!
#1) Here the point: Trump Administration has been pushing Germany to stop building new multi-billion $ OIL &amp; GAS pipeline infrastructure into Russia.  Russia already uses it energy resources to Bully all EU neighbors (that we protect) and Germany is helping them by undercut USA.
Yet another commercial from mr. trump. But yet another day of avoiding the horrific place we are with the pandemic.  150000 have lost their lives and not a mention.

Good on you, Matt. Seen too many people on here gloating about his death because he attended a Trump rally.
Is this a trump election tweet a deflection for crossing the 150,000 covid-19 deaths? For yesterdays AG embarrassment? Is Maxwell going to name trump as a pedophile? Stay tuned...
THIS IS TOTAL BULLSHIT. THIS GUY IS A BULLY HE KNOW HE IS GOING TO LOSE. MR. TRUMP DOESN'T HAVE RUSSIA TO HELP HIM. If we had GENERAL ELECTION NEXT TUESDAY Mr. Trump would lose everything.
She was ‚Äúright there with him‚Äù. So she‚Äôs sorta kinda admitting that the reason ol‚Äô Herm is dead is because he attended a Trump Rally, no social distancing, no mask. Hmmm...  #TrumpIsKillingUs
Any idea which news item Trump is trying to obscure with the stupid bullshit about election delays?  1. 32.9% economic contraction  2. Swann interview on Russian bounties 3. John Lewis funeral  My guess is the funeral. He views his absence as a slight, and the attendees a threat.
Shocking. Sobering. Is that what President Trump meant by American carnage?
Based on his post-Trump verbal diarrhea, I have serious doubts about how sincerely "pro-life" French is or has been. I suspect he saw it merely as another opportunity to grift, as so many of his NT pals have demonstrated how they saw it.
Delay of the election is the only way for sure, 100%, that Donald Trump isn‚Äôt President past 1/20/2021. He‚Äôs bluffing. I call.
Same old, same old that gave us the tRUMP types. There is virtually no  programmatic option that works in practice. Time to stop pretending each side is equally valuable. Tech is proving that bothsideism is damaging. I like some conservatives as ppl but not their wrongdoings.

Good grief Andrew... we will still have 24,000+ military personnel in Germany.  Why must we continue to keep a 40,000 troop presence in Germany?  Poland is building a first class military base for the USA and Trump wants to expand our presence there.

I put up articles about this last week.  They insinuated trump had pushed his hotel in DC and the FBI bldg all along since his administration began.  It has been in the news over the years many times.  And he was told to knock off the crap by investigators.  But here it is again!
trump halted briefings after he told people to inject bleach and put a light inside their bodies to stop covid.  Now he is promoting alien DNA, incubus and succubus, don't wear a mask, there is a cure, demon sperm, sex with demons lady.  Why did the R Senate conspire to keep him?
I think they have said that, several times, loud and clear.  They want every single trump enabler gone.    That is their mission and they are proud of it.
Focus on the Russian bounties. Make trump defend his position. Do not let him deflect.

No it‚Äôs in the constitution that both houses must approve it first.  The spanish flu was worse more deaths it didn‚Äôt get postponed. Trump definitely cannot do it.
BOOM!!!
Trump and Barr are unconstitutional thugs running Stormtroopers in cities, yet many want a national mask mandate and Federal law enforcement out there arresting people not wearing. Bet if a guy got gassed,  beat and dragged off by cops for no mask they would cheer it
No. It‚Äôs really bad. Like Stephanie Meyers wrote 2020. Like trump is the emotional immature Edward and we are all Bella.
What I would expect on  tonight. Top story will be a live report from the NY pizza restaurant that trump tweeted out. In the 57th minute, there will be a snippet of video of Obama, Bush and Clinton speaking at John Lewis service
Even if delayed, Trump still leaves office at noon on January 20th, 2021. Absolutely nothing changes that.
Trump could never give a speech/eulogy because he can't talk about anyone but himself.  I love and miss Obama so much!!
Ask him if he knew this please National Debt Has Increased $5.2 Trillion During Trump's 3 Years as President
National Debt Has Increased $5.2 Trillion During Trump's 3 Years as President
Parts of President Obama's John Lewis eulogy will be played on a loop.  Mad King Trump's going to go berserk.
No one cares about Mad King Trump and he's going to whine about that all over again the next chance he gets.  The spotlight needs to be on him every minute.
No one there wanted trump to say a damn thing.
Donald Trump will NEVER upstage President Barack Hussein Obama!

Trump lies. People voted by mail during the Civil War and WWII.
I would normally agree, but those who follow Trump so blindly and outright disrespect the health and welfare of others around them, good riddance.

He passed away from the Trump Virus. After the first 5K deaths Trumps owns the virus and every victim's thereafter, including Herman Cain passing.
It‚Äôs because those reporters were chosen to ask those questions. Anyone with balls enough to ask about putin bounties or trump‚Äôs epic failure on c19 might receive an angry tweet or lose access. Oh the horror.
Don‚Äôt you think he was tested before he was allowed so close to Trump? Herman Cain is tragedy but it‚Äôs about individual choices.
Does Trump even realize that older people get their insulin and other very important medications via the USPS. They have done this month after month and their lives depend on it.
Getting rid of kushner is just as important as ousting trump.  The Biden team needs to campaign on the entire team of asshats that will be gone when he‚Äôs elected. It‚Äôs a huge selling point.
Herman Cain did not believe in wearing a mask, Trump did believe in wearing a mask.  Wearing a mask protects you from getting the virus, not completely but it help's tremendously.  He died because of the virus and supporting Trump's belief's #TrumpKillsAmericans
Of course he is. Trump is going to undermine the results and declare himself the winner. Welcome to authoritarian rule! Democracy and the USA is finished.

Too late, he sat by and did nothing while Trump betrayed his oath, our country and allies.
Remember over the spring many ‚Äúprimaries‚Äù got delayed/changed to accomodate the shut down. State govs may be inclined to change election dates/mail by dates in an effort to ‚Äúaccomodate‚Äù (ie: round up) voters.   Trump knows whatever he proposes Dems will be against. HydroxyC, etc.
That didn't age well.. I don't want to speak ill will of the dead but he was a grown man that chose to ride or die with this hoax and paid for it. he literally died for Trump.

Trump Takes A Victory Lap Over Alarm Sparked By His Push To Postpone Election Day
Looks like Trump thinks all voters in Florida and Michigan and other states are all Democrats. He appears to be shooting himself in the foot. Republicans vote by mail too...right.
I do like Republicans at least most of them but... wow Trump supporters are literally a bunch of cult members who can't think for themselves. Pure sheep. This isn't even a D vs R thing it's literally common sense vs ignorance.

Sorry, that makes no sense whatsoever. People die in pandemics, and b I'm sorry fur your loss. However, while Obama acted decisively to fight against H1N1, Trump has done the exact opposite. He has countered and maligned the very people he should have been listening to along.

Bottom line: the N.R.A. laundered Russian money into the 2016 campaign and illegally coordinated with the Trump campaign. The N.R.A. needs to have its tax-exempt status stripped. Our documentary details all of this. But we need help to get the doc out.
Trump doesn‚Äôt care if more of his voters vote by mail. Trump doesn‚Äôt care if vote by mail is popular. The best opportunity Republicans have to suppress the vote is by reducing the number of urban voting sites where voters can vote. That‚Äôs the plan!

We didn‚Äôt deserve this type of health, economic, and political climate that Trump carelessly and recklessly led us to. If he is smart he‚Äôll step down. I hear Roger Stone has room for another tattoo on his back.  Trump can end up as a tattoo on Stones back, if not it‚Äôll be worse!
Trump should say that breathing air is good so the dems stop

Did you say ballot harvesting?
Republican Voters against Trump. I believe she‚Äôs in Ohio.
History will remember Donald Trump in one way and one way only: as an accessory to the murder of tens of thousands of Americans. And amazing legacy
I don't think so loll trump is done
I would call it more of a Nazi rally. You were still able to work with Nazi's even if you're on the wrong side. A lot of Trump's tactics are Nazi-like especially the past 2-3 months. Klan is just more of entitled and very narrow-minded White people.. not a real movement.
Yes. And that is why so many deaths are on Trump. If he had modeled and emphasized mask wearing and discouraged the push to reopen so fast fewer people would have died.
Imagine if the Republicans did that for the first two years of Trump, Now maybe you might want to reconsider that change? Harry Reed did it for all judges other than Supreme Court. Republicans than included the Supreme Court. How did that work out for you?
I mean he died from the virus... who cares if it's from the rally or not... honestly it's his fault as much as its Trump's fault.. you have to be a fucking idiot to go to a rally where you know most aren't smart enough to wear masks.
Your right it‚Äôs just disappointing to have Trump as our President
Trump's little crony. Did nothing to help him.
. is a partisan hack. And a Trump-sucking sycophant. And an asshole.
Thanks to Trump and his corrupt leadership for our country going through this terrible epidemic Virus! All Trump cares about is his real estate and his selfish needs to be against the Medical professionals that we have to unite as a country to get this Virus out! Trumpüëéü§•
Call me crazy, but i think this is Trump coded speak for "dont worry i will keep POC out of your neighborhood."
That would be a lie. Trump IS a full blown racist.
Why not flip flop it would extend your demise. If you support trump you‚Äôre a racist.
What‚Äôs shocking is just the utter disrespect. I mean, Trump flat out told reporters ‚Äúno‚Äù he wouldn‚Äôt be going to pay respects to John Lewis.
Trump killed him... just like thousands of others... just for a fucking campaign rally LOL...

Biden did not say that Trump will achieve it, Biden said that he would try. In in fact, thats what Trump said he wants to do. So you  were/are wrong.
If he got help from his gubernatorial allies... we'd end up with a situation where only Blue states vote.  That would not be the outcome Trump wants. It's possible Biden could get to 270 without the deep Red states voting. Trump digs chaos, but not chaos where he loses big.

Very disappointing to have Trump I hope he is finally getting out and we can get our Country back to the people first!

Trump‚Äôs becoming a pariah. The way his kind should be treated....instead of allowed to be President.
No joke, Trump is getting off on this - the moment he realized he could tweet praise for a different black guy who just died on the same day he planned on blowing off respect for John Lewis, I‚Äôm sure a big smug grin crossed his face and he dove for his phone.

I was just seeing if the person saying one person is hateful was also capable of determining if Trump was also hateful. Its called being bias, not being able to be impartial. How does me asking a question implies hatred? Even if I was fishing for a impartial opinion?

Parents aren‚Äôt going to send their children to slaughter for you and who you pray to (Trump). You decided to listen to the lies about the virus ü¶† from Trump and his enablers. You reap what you sow. You are following the Herman Cain path.
And yet the Trump Death Cult refuses to face the implications of his death squarely and instead are doubling down on their idiotic Covid mythology and butthurt about libs being means to them.

Today Trump suggested delaying the election. Obama was reinforcing John Lewis' belief "When you see something that is not right, you must do something," "Democracy is not a state. It is an act, and each generation must do its part."
And Trump voters are conservative, so what does that make him? Your claim was specious and an attempt to discredit the original point, which is that by and large Republicans and far right groups are the biggest pushers re: reopening/masks are ineffective/covid conspiracies.
Them they criticize Trump at Rose Garden
Q: Did Herman Cain tweet that masks would not be required at Trump's controversial Tulsa rally? And was that tweet subsequently deleted?  A: Yes.

As a Trump supporter how can you defend making voting harder.  You can want your guy to win, but ar what cost?!  What country do you live in if it totally ignores the value of voting?!
for the love of  can someone tell trump how to pronounce "plasma"  its not plausema
Biden down only 2 in a GOP poll in a district trump win by 17!
so I'm guessing trump wasn't at the funeral.....
Amazing how you and Cain and Trump and conservatives can say whatever they want, no matter how despicable, but God forbid someone criticizes a conservative, she is labeled hateful, no matter how valid the criticism. Look in the mirror.
And MBS as well, but I totally agree about Putin too. Trump is coddling all the foreign dictators &amp; tyrants from North Korea, to   Russia, to Saudi. Time to shut down Rizvi &amp; Milner. Don‚Äôt let these foreign tyrants buy up our social media. Down with fascism! #bringbackbetter
Thank you, Obama!! Obama, eulogizing John Lewis, takes aim at Trump over voting rights, protest response
He died from the Trump Virus. You neglected to write that.
Rest in peace Herman Cain. Hopefully others will learn from your misplaces trust in Trump.

I actually think the humiliating loss would lead to him not really returning to the job for those two months. His only agenda is ‚ÄúTrump.‚Äù He doesn‚Äôt care about what Mitch might want.   I think he‚Äôll spend December stuffing money into suitcases and arranging to leave the USA.

Yea and I‚Äôm sure the 8 Trump campaign staffers who contracted COVID shortly after the Tulsa Rally must‚Äôve gotten it from somewhere else too. Regardless I guarantee that he and those around him did not wear masks or take the virus seriously which still makes it ironic and foolish
You are losing your hold on the Republican Party!!!  #sad #DementiaDon

Tramp's sheer and utter stupidity is allowing this to take place. We all know that trump spoke with Putin 7,8, or 9 times in the past few weeks. Obviously Putin gave him his orders to reduce the troops
Giving Trump‚Äôs accomplishments their due  -  -
Anyone surprised at that? He spends tens of millions hiding tax information yearly. A look inside these documents would free him from suspicion.  Mr. Trump? Hello? Sir? Mr. Trump? Is this mic. On?

This can't be a real trump account. This fake trump is way smarter.
Donald Trump suggests delay to 2020 US presidential election
Trump supporter and 2016 Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has died at age 74 from COVID-19, after catching coronavirus following his attendance of Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma on June 20th, 2020. Rest in peace. No more senseless deaths!

I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs serious. He‚Äôs messing with fake news. Trump knows they‚Äôll go crazy over this. He‚Äôs like a cat playing with a mouse.
I agree with President Trump that voting by mail will cause major problems and voter fraud. When we have normal elections they seem to have a lot of difficulty, add mostly mail in and there will be total chaos!
But trump can take time during his speech to twice send Well Wishes to assistant child rapist ghislaine maxwell &amp; discuss how he does know her. Prob because he couldn't deny it w all those pictures w them all together floating about...
Sorry for the workers but it‚Äôs a direct effect of no leadership in Washington. Liberate here and there from trump and here we are

"Trump has no authority to delay an election, and the Constitution gives Congress the power to set the date for voting."
That little #twitterjack is teally cute isn't he? Jack,  you are violating our Freedoms os speach and interfering with our 2020 election, even after you lied to Congress that you are not, your first action was suspend Donald John Trump Jr.
Whenever Trump says something is "overly burdensome", all I hear is my kids' whining that picking up their legos is "too hard" and that their "arms are tired"...
Trump is her bosses boss (yes at least 7 levels up). So why hasn't she been given a BCD (bad conduct discharge) already?
Just vote out all the old guard republicans. After many many elections you learn how it all works. There are hundreds of millions of opinions and ours are each only one. There are 2 real choices as of now. For Biden or for Trump, against Biden is for Trump. Help stop madness.
Bernie can't win. I wish he or another candidate could but again a vote against Biden is a vote for Trump. Plain and simple. I have wasted votes before, not this time. It is imperative we get this one gone from the office.  Your freedom and future depend on it.
A vote against Biden is a vote for Trump. That is the sad fuc-- ng truth we have to face. I am not wasting a vote on one who cannot win. It is what it it is.
2/2 it does not surprise me at all that trump is using racist fear as his campaign's theme His total failure of leadership during the pandemic shows he's no president never was never will be he's a bomb thrower &amp; a embarrassment Who used the presidency as a get rich quick scheme
U.S. AG Bill Barr mocked Democrats and   allowed to expose themselves for the fools they are Monday during a House Judiciary Committee hearing Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) attempted to use the occasion to attack President Donald Trump on the coronavirus.
I think people are confusing Trumpism wbeing a Conservative Republican. 1st off, Trump isn‚Äôt conservative. 2nd off, he doesn‚Äôt hold the moral principles that once difined this party. He‚Äôs literally the embodiment of Hitler. We‚Äôre on a slippery slope here if people ignore history.
AG Barr is a liar and needs to reaign immediately! His legacy of sucking Trump's dick and bending over to please him by launching new DOJ investigations into his political opponents will leave him with the credibility of Richard Nixon! He will be going to prison Jan 20, 2021!
As soon as President Obama gets to reclaim 8 years of Republiturd obstruction!  Trump had FULL CONTROL of 2 years and didn't do a fucking thing. Now, he wants to blame Democrats for his failure to deliver on his campaign promises and his failure on his fucking wall? GTFOH!
Amd Trump has wrecked this entire country for four years!  Nadler will not cave to the GOP! He actually has a pair of balls!
Barr is a fucking tool that caves to Trump's every whim. The man is as honest as Mark McGwire saying he didn't use steroids!
What answers?  All he was doing was regurgitating the same bullshit lies that President Trump already spewed for months on end!  Barr has zero interest in the truth. He cares only about making his Fuhrer happy!!!!!

It's the Epstein law. Barr has known him since the 70s Trump has known him as well along with some other predators.  These are the ties that bind. Look and see. There is a reason for all of this.

There is a reason Barr protects Trump. The Epstein  Connection goes back to the 70s with both of them. Barr's father hired Epstein In the 70s to teach at a private school. ( kid in a candy store) follow that trail and see where it leads.
The republicans want everyone back to school and work no matter what.  They are removing the monies given to people on unemployment in order to force people back to work, safe or not. There will be dead children and adults in the wake of the Republican plan. Fu-- off Trump.
They and their cronies are invested in these corporate entities, if they need anything, they call McConnell's phone as he has been bought and paid for years ago. Trump and all of the Gop care way more about money than they do people. Their God is money. Greed kills.

My nephew lives in Seattle. This is one small area of town. The rest of Seattle is going about their daily business like none of this is even happening. Trump has blood on his hands. They told him to stay away he wouldn't do it
Portland Oregon was doing pretty darn good and the protesters or winding down. Then moron trump decided to send in goons and violate the Constitution. He is the king of chaos. He wants a Civil War in the United States.
My nephew lives in Seattle and this depiction that you C with fighting is so so minor. The pictures of Portland intimate that the entire city is a mess. The city is perfectly fine and going about their daily activities. Trump is looking for a Civil War.

It's no use arguing with the willfully ignorant my man. If after all this time people can still call Trump some savior despite the literal mountain of evidence showcasing what a sack of shit he is, nothing will save them. It's doubly confusing for a black trans woman though.
President Trump said putting a bottle rocket up your ass and igniting it was good. They would be doing it just to spite him period.

No. As much as I trust Trump, what would your answer be if Biden or Obama was the President?
We need the instant testing before opening more places. This is getting much worse and will soon be in your town or city. Why is everyone so impatient? Ok because Trump refuses to support the citizens financially during this pandemic. Gop corporate socialist is killing people.

Trumps America is turning into his commercial where there is violence anger and hate. What the hell is wrong with these people? Take your goon squad and get the hell out of peaceful city's before things get out of hand. Trump is trying to make this worse.

FINALLY! Someone fights fire w fire. trump has been landing low blow after low blow &amp; pretty much no one even punches back. And when they do punch back?
...and you think Biden could have done a better job controlling COVID-19? He called Trump all sorts of bad names when he shut the Chinese planes bringing more Chinese into America. Yeah, he would do great . . . or maybe you could have done better - NOT.
Like you can‚Äôt vocalize your concern for child sex trafficking, while ignoring that Trump also had a deep relationship with Epstein, and documents regarding that are leaked. Like what is this cognitive dissonance?
There‚Äôs a weird trend right now with conservatives being really infatuated with child sex trafficking, while simultaneously ignorning that Trump also has a part in it.
If Trump cared about people like they do buildings,there would be no help needed at hospitals plenty of PPE, an instant covid test Troops tracking and tracing instead of instilling fear and anger in cities. These forces should be used to suppress the virus not suppress the people
More conspiracy theoerists will be comung out of the woodwork before the election, trying to blame Trumps failures on anybody but him.  Trump and his cronies plan the big lie to decimate America even more. Confusing those who do not know. Dividing the nation more. Vote him out.

So much winning. You are responsible for the disastrous trump virus. 142K dead on your watch, Donald. So much winning. üôÑ
The prescription drug thing Trump did today. By lowering drug prices helps all Americans. I don't understand why it's not being reported more. It's historic.
We may know why John Roberts is doing what he is doing one day. Does he want Donald Trump to lose November 2020 because there is a name John Roberts on the flight logs of Jeffrey Epstein's Lolita Express. Is it him?
Biden should ease up on that Trump is a racist stuff. Has shown a number of instances of being a racist. At some point Trump is going to throw that in his face. Then you know what he'll do, he'll lie. That's what liberal Democrats do they lie.

I heard after Donald Trump gave his speech about his lowering the prescription drug prices for American people. A lot of the democratic  were upset a bunch of them will heard saying" not getting kick back  it's going to cost them money in there illegal Cayman Islands account.
You know what people are calling Trump a racist a white supremacist. They haven't shown One Clip with him saying anything racist. There is plenty with Joe Biden showing his racism though. If Trump said those things, they'd be screaming it from the rafters.
Trump will sell our closest secrets to the highest bidder. That will guarantee a future credit line for he and his cronies. Traitor.
...South China Sea. I'm willing to bet that they are disarmed. Congressman didn't say it, but I do. President Trump must fire THEM? THEY ARE A DANGER TO NATION. The country is not safe.

No. But he‚Äôs not a Republican and was certainly better than trump.
Hey, heres a bit about me! My names Mackenzie, I live in florida and I hate it here. I go by she/her and I'm pansexual and cis. I hate Donald trump the spray tan man. I love hearing about lgbtq+ news and fully support it. I sing and play ukulele as well as occasionally doing art.
Real News in the Trump Campaign! Cartoons. Does he miss Blues Clues too? Because he definitely needs a Notebook!
I just spoke to a liberal friend of mine. He said what Trump history about prescription drugs is political. I said maybe but at least he's trying to save lives. The liberal Democrats are killing them, in their cities for a vote. Their garbage.
I'm a diabetic and I take insulin. The prices are absolutely ridiculous, some points in my life I had to choose not to eat or take insulin an live. What Donald Trump did today I was so choked up I almost cried. Obama and Joe Biden got rich off these drug companies. Their garbage.Riddle me this.. how is it Ok for Obama to preach at Funeral, how bad President Trump is, yet every other American is BANNED from attending church services?
Your dedication to  is shattering the liberal myth of identity politics. Good Luck, every Trump vote counts to keeping #AmericaFirst. #MAGA #KAG2020
And since you misunderstood  here's some clarification for ya.
If prayers worked, trump wouldn‚Äôt be president.
It really shows the political genius of President Trump to send that tweet this morning. He got everyone on record to demand the election take place on the day it is scheduled and then pointed out to them mass mail in voting would cause massive delays in the election. Brilliant.

Because that never happens when Trump says anything.
y‚Äôall heard trump tryna stay in office by holding off the election because it isn‚Äôt ‚Äúsafe‚Äù??? YOUR TIME IS UP PINHEADD
Trump‚Äôs term is over in January. He needs to know if there is no election, Nancy Pelosi will become president in January. He cannot extend his term. He will only invalidate his election since he swore to serve until his term is over.
There was Trump pic w/ his comment. Came to defense of my  No conservative tweets on his feed.
For those never-trumpers that hv never bn able to get over Trump's locker room talk... #BidenRepublicans
Such a shame his chapter ended being defiant &amp; following behind Donald Trump.
Marcus incited Trump supporters to NOT visit his Camping World stores. I shall honor that.
These are direct orders from trump. Voter suppression is what he wants.

Maybe Trump is in town, the weather is wonderful here; the ‚õ≥ is calling and are breeze.
I'm still very sad that Gohmert tested positive and  couldn't fly on Air Force One with Trump today.  He could have breathed heavily into Trump's rancid orange face the entire trip.  Lost opportunity.
Anybody who wants an absentee ballot like Trump can request one.  Americans do not want unsolicited ballots put in the mail with no traceability or verification.  Don't be a dimwit!
Is Donny dousing him with bleach yet?  Damn, apparently he was this close to getting on Air Force One with Trump.

My husband‚Äôs dad wasn‚Äôt as bad as trump and the family removed his car keys. Then when they found out he had several sets of keys hidden around the house, they sold his car.
My sister is named Karen. She believes in conspiracies and is a trump supporter. She blocked me on Facebook after I told her the government isn‚Äôt poisoning us by air. Jet exhaust fumes are not waves of chemicals being dumped on us.
Just watched your interview with Trump's press secretary.   She said that covid treatments like Remdesivir, plasma and steroids are possible ONLY because Trump broke down bureaucratic walls???? He had nothing to do with them.   And you didn't challenge her.
Sue them. There needs to be a class action lawsuit against MSM for lying. They are malicious and purposely preventing Drs from writing a script. They would rather see ppl die, then Trump be right. That‚Äôs intentional malice!
Class action lawsuit against Big Tech, MSM and Fauci. They are MALICIOUS LIARS! They are preventing DRs from using HCQ because the hate Trump and they don‚Äôt want him to be right. They would rather see ppl die. That‚Äôs intentional malice.
States preventing Drs from prescribing HCQ should be sued for malice. The dirty dems are banning the drug because they hate Trump. They would rather see people die, then Trump be right. That is Malicious!
For a stable genius, Trump knows so little about the most serious issues (scandals) of his presidency. But then he‚Äôs says stuff like he ‚Äúknows better than the generals‚Äù or ‚Äúbetter than experts.‚Äù Well, which is it man, Einstein or imbecile? (that‚Äôs ‚Äúrhetorical‚Äù
You are kiddin right? If any #American who believes in  #1A and #2A doesn't vote for Trump, this country is forever lost as we know it. Hope you listened to Mark Levin this week &amp; what Biden meant when he said "transform America" attacking local rights in suburbs.
Barr spars with Dems on Trump ties, riots at fiery House hearing  #FoxNews DEMOCRATS are such evil folks. Why do they seek to destroy the US Constitution?
Trump and republicans.
Tucker, You are totally wrong about the poll saying we think the country is going in the wrong direction. Riots Black Lives Matter Antifa Anarchy This is what we mean as the wrong direction. We love Trump!
None of these people have ruined our great country like trump has in just 3.7 years. If it‚Äôs not painful to the gop, it certainly is to the rest of us listening to them.
Trump whining about Fauci being highly regarded, and ‚Äú why not me?‚Äù was PATHETIC.
Agreed. The left media, sadly, are more interested in fermenting Trump hate than helping the citizens of the US. Never have we seen such disdain for everyday Americans. Shades of Germany in 1939. We must turn them off.
Rep. Doug Collins: Why do Dems support anarchist activity over law and order?   ALL POLITICAL TRYING TO UNFAIRLY EFFECT THE ELECTION OF PRESIDENT TRUMP.
I think you will have to agree that  "facts and truth" had quite a different meaning before the election of    And you will remember that  introduced us to  "Alternative Facts."  They have become common from the Trump Administration. That is a fact!
When Trump wins re-election they now have a place to run to.
Well it looks like Trump finally built his wall, but around himself undoubtedly!   You HAVE to realize by now that he hates ordinary ppl b/c they‚Äôre poor/dirty peasants. Thankfully, he is NOT our king and that is NOT his castle #movingdayiscoming #LOSER
Not defiant. Stupid. What have these men done to improve the circumstanced to those enslaved in the Dem run cities &amp; used for face ops during elections, then forgotten. Trump puts his money where his mouth is. Look at the improved circumstances for these beleagured Dem tools!
All this crap will end after Trump gets re-elected!
So the posturing continues.. that will change November 4 after Trump is re-elected.
Ha!  If you‚Äôre a Trump enabler then you‚Äôd better pray that all the Past Presidents never get in one room and get their hands on Trump.  They would take turns whooping his ignorant ass.
A person with a narcissistic personality, like trump, cannot be humiliated. When it gets to that point, he will say he didn‚Äôt want to win anyway. He rigged the election for a Biden win, so his base will never accept Biden as legitimate on his own.
This ad is false. Why would a burglar break into grandma‚Äôs house? She has no money and has sold everything of value to pay for utilities and groceries. This ad is aimed at seniors living alone. Vote trump and the burglars will disappear like magic.
Pretty simple: Never Trump. #sad
Birx has lost her credibility. She sold her soul and career to trump. Dr. Fauci continues to fight for the American people. He‚Äôs hired security to protect himself and his family from death threats. Deborah Birx is a turncoat..
I would crawl through broken glass, swim through an alligator infested swamp, and jump from a plane with a faulty parachute just to vote trump out of office.
One of the petty things of trump is refusing to hang the portrait of President Obama. I read where it was placed in a small room. This pisses me off. I hope Biden takes Trump‚Äôs portrait out to the dumpster. But Joe isn‚Äôt petty.
Biden takes aim at Trump over coronavirus in new ad blitz courting seniors   Democrats killed the seniors.
Hunting trump supporters should be a sport
He as well as Obama want to destroy the suburbs:  google AFFH suburbs.  Thank God for Trump
Matt, put on your thinking cap.. The impeachment of trump wasn‚Äôt a failure. He was impeached and it‚Äôs forever. You and your corrupt republicans didn‚Äôt have a trial to remove him from office. You failed and have failed forever.
The gop has destroyed itself. They may have had help from trump, but make no mistake, they had a hand in their own demise.
What in the hell is wrong with trump‚Äôs neck? Tree roots holding his head to his shoulders?
Why not? You pay large conglomerant farming companiex who lost money due Trump's trade war but no other industry that suffered through the Trump Tariff wars. You've paid the largest And wealthiest oil and gas company incentives to look for morr carbon producing energy.
Joe Biden said: if you vote for Trump, you ain't black, so IF YOU DON'T  RESPECT THE FLAG AND THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, YOU AIN'T AMERICAN. RIGHT UNCLE JOE.?

I don‚Äôt want to accuse trump of thinking, but he‚Äôs got to know how horrific he will look being escorted from the WH.
Getting rid of trump and his corrupt administration will definitely help the economy. A win/win situation..
You are attempting to view trump in a rational manner, but his decisions are irrational. It‚Äôs very difficult to even guess what‚Äôs going on in his damaged brain. My opinion is the only thing that‚Äôs keeping him in the WH is it‚Äôs safety.
1.  I can‚Äôt wait to see ‚ÄúJaba the Trump‚Äù try to throw a baseball. 2. We should join the Major League Baseball players and flood the streets with good patriots taking a knee during the National anthem.

This is true. They r trying to intimidate voters &amp; scare us. As far as me &amp; my house just makes me more determined to vote Prez Trump &amp; Repub all the way. Remember what they did when Trump won b4. All set up by crooked Hill/Obama/Soros. They have the terrorist cells ready to go.
He said he would spend millions defeating trump. So far, nothing..
Trump killed more than Vietnam a war he never even was in
I‚Äôve never called him president trump and I don‚Äôt capitalize his name.
Tragic and senseless murder. May God give comfort to his family during this difficult time. #senselessmurder

Sarah Sanders on newly released FBI document: More evidence of 'mass conspiracy' to take down Trump
They are armed and unidentified thugs dressed in military camouflage. They are not trained nor deputized. They‚Äôre arresting, detaining and kidnapping American citizens. Trump praised them for gassing the Portland mayor. Who does that?
I asked about Bloomberg‚Äôs big promise several weeks ago. We can‚Äôt rest until trump is out of office.
Does he realize how much better our lives would be if we had never heard the name Donald trump? I wake up in a panic every morning wondering what danger he has rought upon us during the night.
He didn‚Äôt cancel the convention, the Jacksonville sheriff canceled the convention since he couldn‚Äôt find enough security to protect trumps lard ass. I hope he found out about the other states that weren‚Äôt paid by trump for rallies..

In a way, that‚Äôs good news. Into the new year means trump can‚Äôt take credit for it, stockpile it or price it out of reach for average Americans..
As all good liberals whose mantra is ‚Äúdo as I say, not as I do‚Äù Dr. Fauci does not disappoint.Can you imagine Trump doing something like that?The CNN &amp; MSNBC wolves would be howling for his head. Closer &amp; closer to marxist-fascist rules for society. If you‚Äôre one of us-no rules.

Pres. Trump cancels the Jacksonville GOP Convention, per his press briefing. "It's not the right time for that." Sounds like North Carolina is back on.

No one likes the Epstein #chaos, but President Trump (like many REAL Americans, excluding you), believe in due process - Innocent Until PROVEN Guilty. His love of #America &amp; it's processes are why he was elected.

I want to see trump and his corrupt family dragged from the WH in January, whether it be protesters or the military. I prefer the Vindman brothers do the dragging.
Why are you not in jail? Your corrupt, hateful, dogged efforts to destroy decent people is legend. Remember Arthur Anderson &amp; the fraudulent destruction you wrought on thousands of innocent working Americans. THEN you head up the manufactured Trump witch hunt. How do you do it?
Just saying  is it possible that the Obama Administration spied on the trump campaign until he was inaugurated?  Where is the coverage of origins of the Russian narrative? Just admit you all hate Merica and let‚Äôs move on. We are tired of your propaganda. Q signs on tv
You know... now I‚Äôm glad Trump treated ‚ÄúTed the wanta be Texan‚Äù and his entire family with such disrespect.  He‚Äôs undeserving of respect or even the smallest display of ethical courage.  Ted is always grabbing the left over moral low ground.

Chuck, given the gross exaggeration in covit reporting, your &amp; Nancy‚Äôs push to keep schools closed w assist by unions. Is it possible you are promulgating &amp; hyping this virus to  continue the hate you daily promote for Trump. W left media compliance. Not possible, sad facts.

All the cable news networks talking about trump rejecting the election results, and possibly postponing election ü§î wtf?  Is the media making trump a villian so democratic voters just accept the dem primary results??
Who cares if trump rejects election results.  Good for him.  How do democrats rejects the primary results??
I think President Obama's eulogy of John Lewis probably knocked Trump a couple more points down in the polls.
Obama just called out Trump for screwing with the USPS and trying to suppress the voting rights of the American people.
Trump has used a rollback of a federal anti-segregation rule to appeal to White suburbanites, a racist move like we have come to expect from Trump. Conspicuously absent from the funeral of John Lewis, he continues to prove what a no class loser he really is.
That is how much they hate President Trump.  TDS!!!
Twitter, what is your opinion of Mary trump?
No, they probably don‚Äôt recycle those bottles. Anyhow, I‚Äôm in FL where 90% are elderly Trump supporters. It would take all day to get to my car.

Yea we know trump is the devil.üôÑ.  Joe is no leader. And the democrats are no different than republicans.
Any psychology folks on twitter?    If trump is such a germaphobe, why would he have hang ups about wearing a mask?
There is a lot of talk about it between conservatives?? Lmao! You do realize Texas is a major republican state right? Nobody believes anything you say about president Trump resigning... Do you have evidence of these republicans talking about it? I'll wait...
Trump destroyed Hillary in their debates.  I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll do the same with Biden.   Biden is not functioning with half of Hillary‚Äôs brain power.
This is the lady you believed and re-tweeted #Yikes
I keep hearing journalists pose the absurd idea that trump may refuse to leave office if he loses election.  (‚Äî ridiculous. If he loses, he will be a regular civilian.  He would be trespassing if he didn‚Äôt leave.
I thought I just saw something for Cory lajoie trump car.
Explanation: Trump
Your cable network has reduced your channels to two. On one channel is biden, the other trump. Which one do u watch?
I don‚Äôt want a trump 2nd term.  But the dnc is forcing it on us with their quack candidate joe biden
Ah, but we have the videos of Trump!
Partisan bullshit from the left has killed more people in 2020...it‚Äôs disgusting...all to get rid of Trump

That's just an excuse for Trump's cruelty. Which Barr carries out. Gleefjlly. He and Trump ought to be cellmates!
But I won‚Äôt vote trump
Get your head out of trump land and listen to facts and truth. Plenty of studies done proved that drug did not work and in many cases made things much worse for patients. You trumpster's can't see the true facts in front of you, unbelievable!
He did a really good job to my point of view!! I‚Äôm voting trump again!
Ms president FB it‚Äôs punishing trump supporters, they have restricted my account 3 day las week and now 30 days! Unbelievable what is going on in this country, very sad üò¢

And while I‚Äôm venting...Donald Trump isn‚Äôt ‚Äúgiving‚Äù us anything. It was our money to begin with.
Best you can say is that Donald Trump was always an asshat.
I support President Trump
President Trump guaranteed no costs for testing and has worked with most large insurance companies to waive cost associated with COVID-19 hospitalizations. Those on Medicare, Medicaid &amp; uninsured will pay zero. Fortunately, most don‚Äôt require hospital stays and recover at home.
So the thinking of voters is‚Äî  We have to get rid of trump because he‚Äôs self serving using govt for his own benefit.  What do u call the dnc that cheats Bernie to elevate joe because he won‚Äôt change anything.
Are people asking this question because they know the dnc used fraud to elevate joe, and he is illegitimate anyway??  So even if trump loses to Biden, the results are meaningless.  Joe is a fake candidate
Are u referring to the trump administration era‚Äî with massive unemployment or a democrats administration that didn‚Äôt have pandemics?
ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£So Trump!
This is ridiculous!!! Biden should be having debates with President Trump by now... less than 100 days.... get debating show us what you boys have! Biden has Dementia and Trumps got the Presidency.... let‚Äôs go üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Ummm... Who‚Äôs the POTUS? Not Pelosi. Who kept saying it will go away magically? Trump! We all know who‚Äôs responsible, definitely not Pelosi

Trump did this!!!
Pelosi ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.  Always trying to make it look like she hates trump.
Simple fact is, the majority of the states/cities these ‚Äúpeaceful‚Äù riots are happening in are blue. President Trump offered his support prior to things getting bad and was declined (too proud to take rep help), look what happened. Now they want bailout. ü§î
It does not matter whose admin. this started under, simple fact is, the majority of the states/cities these ‚Äúpeaceful‚Äù riots are happening in are blue. President Trump offered his support prior to things getting bad and was declined, look what happened. Now they want bailout. ü§î

If trump is a bad leader that automatically means joe Biden would be a good leader.   (‚Äî is this statement true?
WE NEED THIS!  Estimated 95,000 men women and children marching against Putin. I wonder what excuse Trump and Barr would use to send in the Storm Troopers if this were in Portland.
I understand. I am in FL too. Every time I see a trump 2020 stand hawking his crap I want to scream. The various cars and trucks loaded with bumper stickers, Confederate flags etc. ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
If you are a feminist will u be voting for:  A. Biden B. Trump
Trump and Barr's America! Wake up!!!
The same journalists who trashed Bernie the entire primary, trash trump daily, and constantly elevate Biden.  If u are a voter msm wants u to vote joe.  Just in case you can‚Äôt read between the lines.
I‚Äôll admit trump is bad, terrible even.  I will also admit that Biden is equally if not worse than trump.
If TRUMP loses maybe it will be the patriotic americans that will not allow a peaceful transition   I think that is a promise
This bitch votes for Trump because her parents told her to
Without congressional approval Trump gave 7.3 billion dollars of pandemic funding to millionaire church leaders who support him while many small businesses were turned down.
Trump said he would next term.  My problem is that joe has been advocating for that for years.
I'm voting Trump, and doing it by mail.
I'm sure that's what you meant.. not being hit by a truck. So glad your concerned about us all making it to the election alive. That way we can all make sure Trump stays in office where he belongs
What exactly has he done for this country. Did he break all time unemployment numbers? Did he have record stock market numbers? He hasn't had to listen to whiney little Trump haters. Get back to your safe space, get your blanket, and cuddle up to some CNN crybaby üò´üò´üò´
Don't need to waste a minute listening to more trump lies!! He's proven himself to be an all around failure over and over again.  You should wake up and see the truth and not spread his lies, racism and hate.
When trump tries to convince England to have the British open at one of his golf courses, is that different from Hillary‚Äôs pay 4 play access.
‚ÄúAll the plans we have for a safe and legitimate general election in November depend heavily upon the ability to expand vote-by-mail. Yet those plans would be completely upended if the United States Postal Service collapses.‚Äù

Trump needs to resign!
You are obviously not at your Florida home where all that Trump crap is constantly up in the face. I‚Äôm afraid to put up any Democrat signs or stickers. I feel like prey down here.
Please let them take trump and his cronies far far away.
Uh excuse me they are blaming Biden for this, uh no trump is president
Trump doesn't care about his own kids!
Why Trump is stlll in office is beyond me. The #GOP is negligent and evil. They support Trump.
Trump did this!
Poor wittle Scotty!! Go cry to Trump. Maybe he can fire someone and fit you in. Most of his staff has no experience or talent either.
Yes, truly a crime... While President Trump rushed to have a hospital Ship standing by, Cuomo opted to send infected seniors to nursing homes instead, that spread the virus and killed innocent uninfected patients.
I have family &amp; friends who live in Northern VA. They either work 4 or do work 4 the Gov. Everyone lives 500k homes wth I love Obama  Stickers on cars, most voted 4 HRC. They r now Trump  Supporters but they will not tell anyone from their  Neighborhood. I'm in Fl &amp; I tell no one
The protestors are out there due to the inept administration. If Trump didn‚Äôt create turmoil and spurn by hateful rhetoric, there would be no need for the protestors. Your argument is ‚ÄúTrumped‚Äù by the law of cause and effect.
I think you‚Äôre just as much of the problem in America as the ones you claim to be ‚Äúparamilitary‚Äù. You do realize that the Trump administration is much like religion, great to follow, but what happens when it‚Äôs too late to realize you‚Äôve been on the wrong side all along?
We knew about Trump in the 1990's in NYC!
mask law now.
Troops are not terrorizing your citizens your own citizens are terrorizing thanks to all the shootings in Chicago while you spend time complaining about Trump instead of protecting the people

Trump did this!
So it‚Äôs President Trump‚Äôs fault if the States didn‚Äôt handle the virus correctly AND it‚Äôs President Trump‚Äôs fault for sending Federal Agents to protect our Cities. Which is it?  Feds for the virus is okay but Feds for violence is bad?  BTW, The virus is China‚Äôs fault.And Trump will step over his body and keep going. He sacrificed his life for naught never to have his name uttered again by the chosen one. Black people are dying 3 times more than whites. How senseless to die being so utterly reckless.
Fo r years, israel has had the cure to diabetes.
Trump turns on Fox News. Turns off John Lewis funeral coverage and sets up his hair-coloring appointment.  Time on his hands.   Trump will clean up the suburbs, because in his demented mind he did ‚Äúmore for Blacks then MLK, John Lewis, or Obama‚Äù.  #wakeUpGOP
Trump won‚Äôt attend final funeral tribute to     silent.  Trump is ‚Äúcleaning up suburbs‚Äù  silent.   dies of Covid19 after joining Trump at a pandemic hotspot. #BlackVoicesforTrump SILENT.  Their silence is Deafening!
I see #HermanCain has passed and trump has already moved on to a new pizza man.
Herman Cain joined Trump with no mask to Trump‚Äôs Oklahoma rally.   #RIP #HermanCain 999
And you missed the one tape of trump giving Putin some massive head.

Trump 2020 bitches. Your getting buried. Trump will win again.
Trump doesn't give a shit about anything but his money and his honey (Ivanka)
Real Americans are smart people,dummy. We wipe our ass with your fake news.Trump will win again. You, Lemon and Cuomo are a bunch of clowns.
Bullshit only because is election year. Thru Puertorricans will vote for Biden we haven‚Äôt forgot the way Trump put us as second class American citizens after Hurricane Maria. After sacrificing the life of our men and women since WWI.  Did you know that Puerto Rico have more men
Did you look at the polls that you sent me? What was the average? Was the average +15? Or is it +3, within the margin of error? You proved my point, but you're too busy trying to be big brain that you missed it. Hillary &amp; Trump were neck &amp; neck, especially in swing states.
All of the polling for Joe Biden shows he's ahead of Trump way more than Hillary ever was against him.
So I'm driving in Bridgeton, NJ (Salem County) for a work assignment... and I see these two flags flying on this home's lawn.  I get close enough to snap a picture.  An American/Confederate flag &amp; a Red TRUMP flag.  In NEW JERSEY.  YES... I know it's Salem county... but DAMN!
I want you to go and find me an inaccurate poll for the general election of 2016 within a week of the election. All polls showed Hillary and Trump within margin of error, and she won the popular vote by +3.
5 weeks is a long time - like 1 less GA Trump voter long time.
Bad enough you can‚Äôt drive through Palm Beach without feeling like you aren‚Äôt white/rich enough to be there, now they are making sure that all the POC who work for them have to travel from satellite slums on the east side. Since it‚Äôs not worth the hassle, Trump hires foreigners.
I appreciate you being the toughest questioner in the WH Press corps, but this opening sentence plays right into the narrative that it‚Äôs the Dems fault. The failure lies with Trump &amp; Mnuchin‚Äôs inability to negotiate a package that provides actual assistance to those who need it.
True. American. Patriots will put and end to the crazy Goverment the Democrats have tried to force us to except ! They are crazy and out of control ! They have shown all Americans there true colors ! President Trump will win ! And put an end to all this insanity!
Your time is getting closer to prematurely be over for ever ! Trump 20/20 nov 3 . Democrats will be finished for ever
$5 says he loses in a landslide. Too many voters now see that everything he does is driven by outdated views on what made America so great.  Trump divides people, lies and exacerbates problems. He is not working to solve anything.
Trump family investment in the production.
We had to change the theme of our restaurant, which was faded glory red white and blue with all the flags of our country hung from the rafters. People began to assume we were political. Business divebombed. Trump is not as popular as he thinks.
Oxford U, funded by Gates were set to study hydroxy in Europe.  Study was HALTED as Covid19 patients administered this malaria drug immediately developed heart arrhythmias.  Top research docs vs Trump voodoo.  Go with Oxford! Also, if it worked, guess what? EVERYONE WOULD USE IT!
Freedom from decent folk, Devin invites you to join him in Debachery and Lechery with men pretending to be female Trump supporters. It‚Äôs a Catfish Delight! Let all your secret glory hole desires be filled in the Parler!

Democrats have proven they want one thing. Maybe two. I want to attack President Trump in every way possible. They also want to destroy the Constitution and the survivability of each American business.
This is why electing Joe Biden, though necessary I believe, will be pointless because the democrats will NOT do a single thing to prevent the next Trump. We must take over the Democratic party.
We cannot blame Trump for the outcome of the Covid virus. Obama was the most corrupt President and Trump is trying to fix things. Really hard to do when he is attacked for everything and ignorant people don't help stop the spread. Lets also look at CDC.
IMPEACHED PRESIDENT TRUMP IMPEACHED PRESIDENT TRUMP ENJOY YOUR RETIREMENT.
here's an insight into why many DETEST news staff. Trump's Tulsa rally on FOX crushed MSNBC &amp; CNN attracting 8 MILLION viewers but NBC News terms it "underwhelming"-Actually TIKTOK users sabotaged it &amp; Media creates a TRUMP FAILED narrative.

Correct the Problem that Donald Trump fails to Correct or deal with....
After Nov. 3rd please take sad hurt pix of all Trump clan members on their way out of town.
The answer is always yes to the question ‚ÄúDid Trump lie?‚Äù The subject is immaterial.
Trump is the Typhoid Mary of Covid. Herman Cain attended Oklahoma Trump shindig and has been hospitalized with Covid19 ever since.  Trump never mentions Cain. Trump can‚Äôt even wish him well.
Tell me when we have effective vaccines AFTER Biden is in office, and how many obstructionist GOP members are ousted along with Trump. Then I‚Äôll give you my answer.
Trump‚Äôs strategy is to gin up fear. He does this by tearing America apart. Putin could not have pick a better foil.
Trump wins every time his supporters infiltrate peaceful protests to destroy property.  State law enforcement and   simply need to ID persons attending protests NOT to actually support BLM, but send message across nation the #BLM is a danger.  ID and report it out.

lol lunatic right wingers crying because people protest donald trump, meanwhile trump acts like he wouldn't accept Democratic decision of an election
This shit is so god damn over
Trump is that relative you hope stays away from your funeral, so people can mourn respectably without it turning into a sideshow.. so it‚Äôs a good thing.
Remember...   "All that matters is that we get Trump out of office even if we're voting in another piece of shit cut from the same cloth"  Smh lol
The biggest problem will be Trump declaring a National Emergency, a "State Of War,"  turn off internet communications and postpone elections.

Didn't lewis say Trump would be re-elected over his dead body?  ;)
Really, the democratic party has disassociated itself from the people, the things they do and what they say are out of the reality of the American people, in the end, more and more supporters of Trump join in, the shot came out of the butt.
Until Trump, yes.
Maybe no one told you Trump has been in office for three years.
Trump‚Äôs number 1 mission since he was 10
Please, wise ones, tell us all that must be done--in all fields...law enforcement, IT, Congress, media focus on new P and VP rather than Trump's shenanigans (our customary entertainment).
Rick nails it. The washing off the stain of staunch Trump support from Senate cloakrooms and congressional clubs has already begun. #passtheSoap #noWorking #FindANewJob #BeBest
He made no progress on what he campaigned on.   NO infrastructure investment, revitalized NO inner cities,  helped NO ‚Äúforgotten men‚Äù but white nationalists.  All he DID was stir up a race war. Them vs us.   Obama, as the foreigner.  Ivanka, the princess.  Trump conned America.
It‚Äôs great he came to his senses but a question came to mind immediately I read this. What character did he expect the country to have during a Trump presidency?
Trump has played more golf on your dime then Obama did in 8 years Your Dime Mrs.
When is some going to out thistle Fuck,maybe Trump will do us the honor
This should be more alarming to you than anything else. Joe Biden effectively has one of the easiest presidential runs and US history. Because people are so discontent with Trump that all he has to do is sit back and do nothing and he will blow out Trump.
Lol wow. I'm no Trump supporter, but him throwing out the first pitch for 1 game would never make me jump ship. Let them move to the Mets. We have no room for bandwagon fans.
No should surprise us. William Barr wipes Trump‚Äôs booty. I apologize for the words, but we can‚Äôt expect anything normal from this administration. Keep our eyes üëÄ open and get ready for war. Trump forgot one thing. We are the United States üá∫üá∏
We can not stand down, back off. All eyes üëÄ opened 24/7..Can‚Äôt fall asleep for a second on this lunatic sociopath. I read John Bolton‚Äôs book üìñ I got the Mary Trump‚Äôs book üìö on Tuesday for my birthday. I‚Äôm on my 3rd time reading because I keep retaining. Trump is Diabolical üò±
He‚Äôs been doing it since day 1. Then again, every Trump business has done nothing but bleed money, and they‚Äôre all desperate that their biggest fraud of all is ending soon.
Trump is fighting like any criminal that is trying to avoid prison.
I live in a senior community in SW Florida, I‚Äôve lost a majority of my acquaintances here because I won‚Äôt wrap myself in the trump flag. No big loss. In fact, it‚Äôs edifying to know who is a good neighbor and who would kill and eat you in case of hurricane or national crisis.
They blame trump if the sun rises in the east.
Don't try to confuse his poor little brain with any actual facts. They don't want facts. They want someone to masturbate their egos and tell them everything wrong in the world is Trump's fault.

This would require a NATIONAL call to service. Federal funding and workers retrofitting existing schools where feasible or setting up class rooms on open space lands.  TRUMP is doing none of this! He is busy inventing one-off jobs to nowhere for his daughter.
Definitely, Trump has something on Lindsay.
Trump said he had conversations with world leaders..Sure he did! He called PUTIN and NBA..All this time he has been preparing for the massive invasion he‚Äôs putting into place. We‚Äôre headed into ARMAGEDDON. He‚Äôs even been having our soldiers killed!!! #FactCheck

Donald Trump will say he was given a "small loan" of a million dollars by his father and in the same breath call himself a Republican. LMAOOO
Trump appears to not care about US Troops since he did not question his friend Putin about the bounty on US Troops. It‚Äôs time for Trump to resign in shame now. Where are the republicans.

Putin wouldn‚Äôt do it any better.   Trump undermines (in attempts to destroy) the foundation, character and grace of the office he ‚Äútemporarily‚Äù holds.   He mocks established protocols and all who possess integrity, professionalism and knowledge he sorely lacks.
It‚Äôs good to see life long Democrats and Republicans uniting for America and for Trump.
the trump virus sounds about right. we should all call it that. he earned it.

100% of educated suburban moms kicked Trump to the curb l6 months in to his 1st term.   November 2rd or BUST!
I‚Äôm assuming someone or many are listening in. Trump is so fucked.
Step 1: Trump loses in the largest landslide in US history. Step 2: don‚Äôt worry about how he is escorted to the üöÅ
States don‚Äôt have resources to mend services required to rebuild community. Cheap labor lured Corps to deinvest in US.  Fed‚Äôl reinvestment required. Living wages, training, education for next-gen jobs.  Trump ran on THIS, got elected, sat on his hands. Launched race war.
Trump may be an obtuse ignorant divider along racial lines BUT he is following a suburban white fear script that he believes will work. It won‚Äôt. Everyone see through his hate mongering. It‚Äôs turning more white voters against him.
Mayors of cities overwhelmed by joblessness, homelessness, gang violence, drugs, have long required social programs/infrastructure $ Trump spoke to this on campaign trail!   He DID NOTHING.  Jobs. Safety. HC/house for homeless.  Hand gun/gang control. Neighborhood policing.
Is the WORST president in the history of this nation. He is an embarrassment, lying, traitor, hateful, racist, corrupted, ignorant dictator that only cares about himself and his big fat ego.  #VoteTrumpOut #VoteByMail2020 #DictatorTrump

Open your ears Huge! He is conning you. He‚Äôs playing the evangelical trump card.
Objectively speaking Donald Trump is easily the worst president we've ever had post-slavery. He's literally what you get if you took all the bad things about Nixon &amp; Reagan and put them into 1 president.
This tweet implies a lot of things and the biggest one is that Trump has really been ignoring his responsibilities for not only 6 months but also 3.5 years. His handling of this pandemic has only magnified how little he's truly done as the leader of the free world. Dude is TRASH.Open your eyes he works for  himself...he‚Äôs greedy corrupt toxic  human . He‚Äôs crapping all over his base by eliminating fair housing, giving  them false info on virus and the people you mention came up thru the ranks inspired by John Lewis not selfish Trump.  Get real.
The smallest thing in life is to defend my honor. Reason why, as sit here criticism towards our President. Yet I seen a family going down and I picked them up. God bless President Trump!!
Only 247 People Are Watching Joe Biden Attempt to Read a Teleprompter in His Basement  Quite an improvement over the day he had 19 people watch his event. That was the day that President Trump raised $20 million online.

No... I credited Obama with the decrease in unemployment from 2008 to 2016. After that it was Trump‚Äôs economy since he took office in January 2017, which is why I credited him with bringing unemployment down 1%. It‚Äôs his fault now because he‚Äôs the sitting president.
The Magas have been promising chaos &amp; civil war since middle 2016 if Trump didn‚Äôt win, so no change there.

Are you awake! Trump is a dictator. He used our military against our own people for a photo opt. Our general called him out for it. He goes after black lives matter and let‚Äôs his goons stand in front of a court house with ar-15s and says liberate. You wake up

Just a horrible deal. Perhaps Trump is laboring under the assumption that Kodak, shorn of its technology edge and top thinkers, is the company he remembers from the 60s
Hard to argue with that, I suppose. If we‚Äôve learned anything about Trump, it‚Äôs that he‚Äôs not a details guy. And secondarily, he‚Äôs not a big picture guy. #hmmmm

Trump claims that the 2020 election is ‚Äúrigged,‚Äù hours before he claims he will win the election ‚Äúbig.‚Äù  Doesn‚Äôt that mean that Trump is rigging the election in his favor? Just asking for a friend, named Joe Biden.

I think you owe  an apology for this article on 4/24.  It hasn‚Äôt aged well.

The Dems talk safety of the people in line as a reason to do mail in voting. If it‚Äôs such a safety concern then delay it ?Talking safety aren‚Äôt we?  Trump gets the Dems to fall for the bait every time.   Why r mail in ballots already ‚ùå off for Dems in NJ ? This on news weeks gap
So you prefer Facism? That is the road Trump is going down.  I prefer the Democracy we already have and Trump and the GOP are trying to destroy!

Trump as gospel
Just googled Pompeo again. I had forgotten what a well-educated &amp; experienced piece of trash he was. I guess because the 1st 2 qualities are not mandatory requirements for Trump appointments.
BREAKING:  Trump just told people to avoid crowded places.  He's only about 120 days late!  If he told people to do the same thing when he was holding his rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Herman Cain would likely be alive today.  RIP Herman Cain.
It is not truth or even factual, it is a assumption, and is a irresponsible statement from a known Trump hater.
This is good news because dropping all charges was the Trump/Barr agenda, right? (Sorry, a bit behind w/this atrocious Trump scandal)
Imagine how many heads Trump lives rent free in.

I'm a little disappointed with the group.  Last week I asked how many would join me in filing a "false advertising" claim with the FTC against the Trump campaign.  It's a federal crime to broadcast or print lies in advertising.  I got a grand total of 3 responses. Sad!
Bickering for months until Supreme Court rules due to confusion it wasn‚Äôt a fair election. Trump and Barr repeat every time election rescheduled. Civil War ensues, sadly our democracy dies along with 500,000 innocent Americans due to COVID.
People are vile &amp; most are bond servants to to partisanship. Man, the comments. üòû 1) People that wear masks and stay home are still dying. Ask me how I know.  2) The virus doesn‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre meeting for a ‚Äúrally‚Äù or a protest.  3) They‚Äôre more like Trump than they realize
Public announcements from both sides continue and sow confusion in the electorate. Many Trump voters stay home and GOP heavy election locations do not open. Dems show up in force on Election Day and in mail in ballots to give Biden decisive landslide. Trump won‚Äôt concede.
Sounds to me that a likely scenario is Trump and Barr ‚Äúannounce‚Äù in late October the election is being delayed due to COVID safety concerns (which Trump has of course ignored COVID up to this point). Congress clearly asserts its power to squash the idea.
Everything trump touches eventually dies
Yeah. No. That's your wheelhouse. I mean it's got to be tough. You're wrong. About everything. You're stupid but you think you're smart. You imagine yourself a patriot, but deep down you know by supporting Trump you're a traitor. Of course you hate yourself.
Dude. He went to a trump rally, bragged about how he would not wear a mask, caught covid-19, suffered for a month, and died. You idiots are so bent on owning the libs, that you'll dream up conspiracy theories as you die, never admitting you might have been wrong.

A question that has been asked every single day since before Trump took office.
Dodge &amp; deflect because you got zero response to legitimate criticism other than, "But Trump!"  Don't hate on voters for Bidens failure to do the one job he's got right now, EARNING votes.  You don't get to demand them, particularly when you've got a history like his.#NeverBiden
Trump IS NOT self-destructive to his base or the GOP.   You need to counter his insane, chaotic personality &amp; policies with the sane, compassionate policies that provide a material improvement among the people‚Äîthe electorate.  Inspire voters &gt; civility &amp; optics
Maybe that‚Äôs what Trump meant when he said he was ‚Äústrongly tested‚Äù, lol!
Reading about his business dealings in South Africa, it's no wonder he loves Trump. Deadbeats have to stick together.

This guy has flip flopped since day 1.    Says we didn‚Äôt need to wear masks in March.  Yes he said it n admitted it.   He said was a lie bc front line people didn‚Äôt have the PPE yet.  Trump follows his advice yet u hate T but Fauci has high approval rating for handling Covid üôÑ

The Trump administration and GOP also have no plan in place to deal with a continually declining birthrate, instead insisting "it will fix itself in time". Without plans in place to stabilize a decline, it will eventually lead to a deep crisis in our country, like that of Japan.
However, Social Security Chief Actuary Stephen Goss, a Bush-era financial advisor [for the Ways and Means Congressional committee] backed by the Trump administration, is still insisting on a favorable 2020 report that was made before the pandemic.

It‚Äôs like a vicious cycle for Trump.  He screws up and then he gaslights us into believing it never happened.  Then he blames it on someone else.
The law that Trump got rid of encourages DEREGULATION in local zoning, which Trump's own HUD was in favor of in 2018. Classic GOP twisting themselves into intellectual pretzels to appeal to the base with "black people = poor and crime" messaging.

Tied? Biden &amp; Trump are only tied in Georgia polls??  That settles it, then. Georgia is the most ignorant of the sister states (Georgia &amp; Florida) on a % basis.
So much this.  I honestly can't understand their campaign strategy, they are running to the right of Trump on several issues and telling not just their base, but well over half the entire country to pound sand on several major policies.  I can only assume they want to lose?ü§îüòñ

Since Trump has no real political allies  nor organization, the Koch forces filled the Executive and Cabinet structures. Win-win for Koch.

Trump came out a while back and said he was revoking Brennan‚Äôs security clearance. That was public info. I haven‚Äôt seen anything about the rest of these clowns.

Seriously Lori,  Everytime I heard a Democrat speak, all I could hear was a mean fart bag exploding.  You are so right, they are mean, cold, obnoxious and not for protecting our rights for protection.  All they care about is trying to fake making Trump lk bd
Good luck with that! Trump should cut all federal funding to that city period.
How on earth can you make such a wildly generalized statement when there are millions of Trump supporters?!  And actually, the divide comes when the Deep State abuses and kills our children.  Step out of your box.
‚ÄúA picture is worth a thousand words.‚Äù Sometimes. Other times it‚Äôs just dumb af, like tRump supporters.
Please don‚Äôt do that stupid and transparently partisan thing where you oppose Trump‚Äôs decision to bring some troops home cuz you hate the man. You don‚Äôt have to celebrate it. Just let it happen.
Trump, the biggest orange head WHINER ever, Fox now tells the facts, and you hate the facts
exactly so go do some research. I have. Facts don‚Äôt lie. Trump has helped minorities more than any other president ‚Äúsugar‚Äù. He‚Äôs not racist, Joe Biden is super racist but you won‚Äôt admit that. Joe Biden has called a former kkk member a mentor &amp; he‚Äôs put MANY minorities in Jail!

Anything the Trump touches is for his and cronies benefit only.

Not that I want the GOP to win a single seat, anywhere in November. But they‚Äôve got to be seriously replacing Trump at the top of the ticket.

Rep. Louie Gohmert tests positive for coronavirus, cancels Trump trip

BREAKING: President Trump just defended Russia arming the Taliban against US Troops, claiming that America also armed the Taliban so they could fight Russia.  If this isn‚Äôt treason, I don‚Äôt know what is!  Trump chooses Russia over America EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.
It‚Äôs ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù when Democrats do this but it‚Äôs heroic when Trump does it.
What‚Äôs your point? I should vote for Trump? Good luck with that.üò∑

NATO is an alliance for Russian deterrence. It is in the best interest of US national security to maintain it, not to mention European regional security. Trump making this out to be a punishment for Germany is ridiculous. Watch for a more aggressive Russia.
In fact, these aren't peaceful protestors at all. They're very Crminally Violent Marxist ANTIFA &amp; BLM Rioters. That's why a Republican President Trump of this Great Nation has done what Democrat Mayors and Governor's failed to do. That is; Uphold the Law. No excuses.

Diving further into the bizzare abyss of  Trump‚Äôs protectorate, let‚Äôs clarify a few things 1) taking down wild, misleading video is good 2) nothing is caused by demon anything 3) decrying political interference w/medicine thru a spectacle supported by partisans is projection
Trump is so much in bed with Putin I believe he won't touch this man simply for the fact of money and lots of it. When he gets defeated don't be surprised if he packs his family to avoid prosecution and moves in with Putin!!!
So far the Trump supporters I know have not changed their opinion on him. They think he is great and doing a great job. They blame the media and truly don‚Äôt think the virus is as serious as the media says
Sleazy Donald Trump is just a Trojan Horse for Russia. He will do whatever they want!
Thought he lived up Trump's butt.Clearly, Trump doesn't understand how the Constitution works but someone around him does - therefore, 8 hours later, he holds a press conference in complete opposition of  his original tweet.  Question is, can he still be impeached given his "retraction?"
ask Trump how it feels to go through life like that
A write-in is prob same as a vote for Trump. In the past it wasn‚Äôt as important to vote for 1 or the other, &amp; years ago I actually wrote in in 2 diff elections. But this election is too important to waste a vote on someone who won‚Äôt win. Don‚Äôt be a coward.

Trump finally said something today that I agree with. He said the virus should have been stopped. Absolutely right. It should have been but you were too busy calling it a hoax and saying it would magically go away. Trump is to blame. He had a chance to control it and failed
5-6 years ago if you told me Trump would win presidency &amp; say/tweet all the things he's said/done...I would've never believed any of it. Not to mention, I would never think he'd get away with any of it...but here is 2020 for ya

Agreed! I‚Äôve been a silent cheerleader for them. I don‚Äôt trust that they‚Äôre not going to flip the script after Trump is out and start pushing money toward electing Republicans, so I don‚Äôt give them money, but I love that their current goal is the same as ours.
I have no doubt Trump would like to delay the election that he's going to lose. I also think he's trying to deflect from the news that he's giving Putin a pass on paying the Taliban to kill U.S. soldiers, and that Trump has horrifically mishandled #COVID19 &amp; our economy.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.

It's very late at night and I'm awake again. It is so evident our country will be destroyed if Trump is re-elected. So why is it even a question? I spent my entire life helping children in public schools as a teacher and a principal. How can anyone think of re-electing this man?

Law is rapid by thugs  that we have no clue Who they are. The justice dept, has run amuck, a pandemic out of control, And a man who will do whatever he needs to to remain in that office.  It‚Äôs going to take more than our vote...,that‚Äôs not enough,  Trump has more lives than any
Somebody has a lot of stock invested inthis drug including Trump.  It is absolutely embarrassing to think we have a man running our country that believes in voodoo doctors from the podium of the whitehouse.  And we can‚Äôt remove him why????

Ahhhhh. That poor baby.   asks Trump a few questions.  He can't handle them so he runs to his bunker--his safe space.  What do you call that again, Tomi?
Trump will never have a plan regarding the virus or unemployed starving Americans. His election and political power is first and foremost, always has been. May he rot in hell

I was considering this, Trump will have taken probably a year of my life due to his inaction on the coronavirus. A year of not seeing my children, my friends...He is and always has been an incompetent. Those in doubt of this, just listen to him, read his tweets, note his actions.
EVERYTHING Trump has done or attempted to do is the "deal of the century " and a massive failure well before his insane presidency. Conservatives have always buried us and  relied on democrats to dig us out.This is worse than usual however Biden will do it.
We only speak truth to Trump. He‚Äôs earned every deserved insult, criticism and and judgment made against him.  And so much more!!! We can‚Äôt wait until you are gone from the presidency and gone so the rest of the work never has to see you again.

Not necessary to have Trump throwing bull at Joe putting him on the   defensive We know which is a patriot, intelligent,compassionate, not a racist has a SOUL!
We love President Trump and will be re-electing him.
I would agree with you.  I'm not sure that Biden has the will or (whatever) to do real-time fact checking of Trump during the debate.  He should pass.

#TrumpEliminatesPostOfficesToStopVoting Report on CNN by voter rights expert Ross Berman,the reason Trump intends shutting every post office down is to stop votes by mail,&amp; fact vote by mail is very safe but people wait last minute to send &amp; overwhelm post office.Send right away
Well  trump hates women also but 43% of white women support him. Explain that to me
Every traditional Republican understands that mail in / absentee voting is a Republican strong point.    But trump  was  a Democrat all his life, so of course he does not understand that.

He passed away from the Trump Virus. After the first 5K deaths Trumps owns the virus and every victim's thereafter, including Herman Cain passing.
Herman Cain did not believe in wearing a mask, Trump did believe in wearing a mask.  Wearing a mask protects you from getting the virus, not completely but it help's tremendously.  He died because of the virus and supporting Trump's belief's #TrumpKillsAmericans
Trump supporters assume they are the ‚Äúsmart people‚Äù in this instance.  They are not. Not now. Not ever.
I am not sure if I should believe what you're saying. Say that now and say something else in the end is not the same. You called Trump a conman.and now you're bossom buddies..thanks but no thanks.
Here's his "politically liberal, through and through" hero, saying he's going to... vote for Trump.
"Through and through."  Sexism and racism are not "cultural." They are core conservative "values."  Here's your political liberal saying he'll vote for Trump. Sorry he had to make you like quite so stupid.

Trump is setting up to nullify the November 3 Election. He‚Äôs saying it might take months and years before we find out who won. Folks, we need to hit the streets as soon as possible.
Trump does not deny that he wants to delay the election in November.
Trump bought the Miss America contest for access to young girls. And he‚Äôs clearly out of his mind.  And you‚Äôre a hypocrite and a fool.
Watching his propaganda news briefing, Trump said that things in Florida is getting better. Yesterday some 264 died and today, we‚Äôll over 250 from COVID-19. How can he lie and the Fox crowd blelieves him. They are complecit in his crimes.
Trump, mcconnell and barr should be tried for treason as soon as possible.

Analysis | Trump‚Äôs Four-Pinocchio interview on Russian bounties By Salvador Rizzo
Trump may not be eloquent by anyone‚Äôs standards, but he is a prodigious liar.
This pathetic b/c you killed him!  Trump mourns 'American Patriot, and great friend' Herman Cain
We didn‚Äôt deserve this type of health, economic, and political climate that Trump carelessly and recklessly led us to. If he is smart he‚Äôll step down. I hear Roger Stone has room for another tattoo on his back.  Trump can end up as a tattoo on Stones back, if not it‚Äôll be worse!
Charlie, all Trump does is lie, and self-aggrandize, and talk like the fascist he is.
I would call it more of a Nazi rally. You were still able to work with Nazi's even if you're on the wrong side. A lot of Trump's tactics are Nazi-like especially the past 2-3 months. Klan is just more of entitled and very narrow-minded White people.. not a real movement.
Yes. And that is why so many deaths are on Trump. If he had modeled and emphasized mask wearing and discouraged the push to reopen so fast fewer people would have died.
Imagine if the Republicans did that for the first two years of Trump, Now maybe you might want to reconsider that change? Harry Reed did it for all judges other than Supreme Court. Republicans than included the Supreme Court. How did that work out for you?
I mean he died from the virus... who cares if it's from the rally or not... honestly it's his fault as much as its Trump's fault.. you have to be a fucking idiot to go to a rally where you know most aren't smart enough to wear masks.
Trump's little crony. Did nothing to help him.
Call me crazy, but i think this is Trump coded speak for "dont worry i will keep POC out of your neighborhood."
That would be a lie. Trump IS a full blown racist.
What‚Äôs shocking is just the utter disrespect. I mean, Trump flat out told reporters ‚Äúno‚Äù he wouldn‚Äôt be going to pay respects to John Lewis.
Trump killed him... just like thousands of others... just for a fucking campaign rally LOL...

Trump‚Äôs becoming a pariah. The way his kind should be treated....instead of allowed to be President.
No joke, Trump is getting off on this - the moment he realized he could tweet praise for a different black guy who just died on the same day he planned on blowing off respect for John Lewis, I‚Äôm sure a big smug grin crossed his face and he dove for his phone.
RIP to #HermanCain who died from COVID after attending a Trump rally without a mask. Not intending this as a ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù at all, but a plea to anti-maskers to maybe reconsider the whole mask thing.
I was just seeing if the person saying one person is hateful was also capable of determining if Trump was also hateful. Its called being bias, not being able to be impartial. How does me asking a question implies hatred? Even if I was fishing for a impartial opinion?
And yet the Trump Death Cult refuses to face the implications of his death squarely and instead are doubling down on their idiotic Covid mythology and butthurt about libs being means to them.
Q: Did Herman Cain tweet that masks would not be required at Trump's controversial Tulsa rally? And was that tweet subsequently deleted?  A: Yes.

Amazing how you and Cain and Trump and conservatives can say whatever they want, no matter how despicable, but God forbid someone criticizes a conservative, she is labeled hateful, no matter how valid the criticism. Look in the mirror.

I actually think the humiliating loss would lead to him not really returning to the job for those two months. His only agenda is ‚ÄúTrump.‚Äù He doesn‚Äôt care about what Mitch might want.   I think he‚Äôll spend December stuffing money into suitcases and arranging to leave the USA.

Yes, but Trump is an accomplice
We will all miss Mr Cain! Great American! Patriot! Self-made MAN! Now, MSM/Democrats now use this tragic loss for talking points, gain political profit and against President Trump's rally. Why..to prevent Presidential debates, as they know Biden's blubbering will be a disaster!
Mr Cain was great American! Ardes supporter of Capitalism and President Trump supporter! He will be missed! MSM, Dems use this loss to promote promote political agenda: Mask were not required on Trump's rally, BUT not forbidden!

He‚Äôs just a jackass. Ppl have been doing that with Trump his whole life. The average person can‚Äôt even begin to understand how someone can be stupid as Trump.  So they begin to say shit like ‚Äúman he gotta know something we don‚Äôt.‚Äù
So you telling me there‚Äôs a corona cure and Trump ain‚Äôt even giving it to his friends? How y‚Äôall square that?
No. They still are at risk that Trump will tweet a mean thing about them.
Trump ain‚Äôt even tweet a RIP for the nigga. Go grab at slice at his homeboy pizza shop tho. Lmaooooo
actually, the districts and electoral college helps the republicans because of gerrymandering. clinton got 2.8 million MORE votes than trump, and she still lost. and the dems ACTUALLY care about the people and districts, unlike republicans.
Cant sue the Trump campaign for it, unless he signed the NDA the Gen Z/KPOP signed onlineü§£ü§£ü§£ For rhe supporters who did not attend the rally, please express your generosity to the teenagers for saving your bloody lives from the hoax.
Absentee voting is mail in voting.. you think people are stupid. ... Well Trump supporters are stupid and unamerican for supporting a Dictator / Wannabe King. We fought a war to liberate America only to have some people wanting a monarchy?  .. #Wannabefuhrer

NOT supporting Fox or Trump or Trump JR - the point of this is to help spread the word on Big Tech's censorship.
Same guy that told us its a hoax at Trump spreader rally?
Why would a black man support Donald trump?
i agree and wish for what you said!! but how do the american people get a fair election if trump steals the ballots from blue districts??
I agree but we need to see some debates. Biden needs to go heads up with President Trump. We need to see them both answering questions that they have not read and see who really is telling the truth and who is the better man.

Trumpian Holy Shit-Water is what  is selling, sad you can only get 4 millions out of 63 million Trump voters to watch.
Remember You SAID YOU'D VOTE for YOUR MOTHER in 2016 NOW you go with the Flow..Yea JUST like a Rep.. youll probably STILL VOTE trump just wont admit it SOME people Dont FORGET..
Two of the 4 are in China.. You would rather blame Trump coward
Agreed. What really creases me is that Trump cares nothing abt Rx prices‚Äîhe's only doing this as what will assuredly be 1 of many last-ditch efforts 2 buy votes. He's a capitalist pig, as bad as they are+doesn't give a monkey's how much they overcharge. Despicable+transparent.
is the only waterhole for desperate Trump voters, they go there to be lied to because it makes them feel good, never mind it's all lies and misinformation, the poor bastards don't know any better
Due to the Trump‚Äôs late, slow, disastrous approach to the coronavirus pandemia, USA is a huge graveyard with more than 150000 deaths and he is still misleading people . Trump‚Äôs inflammatory comments aggravated the racial crisis due to police brutality! Trump is unfit! Vote blue!
Ask yourself this... how many Joe Biden flags or lawn signs have you seen in your neighborhood compared to Trump flags and lawn signs ?!?! That‚Äôs the real question!
I don‚Äôt think Trump spoke today!
You mean this book? Don‚Äôt worry the RNC will buy in bulk so it‚Äôs not a total flop, like it did for the previous one!
Idiot, what do you expect when  is the only Trumpian cable station in the nation? Matter of fact, 63 million voted for Trump, so Fox is doing really bad when only 3 or 4 million of them even bother to watch.

Obama used the politics that Lewis lived for in his eulogy which is deeply appropriate and seems to be what Lewis would have done. If people see that waving the banner of voting rights as anti-trump‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ I think that might say more about the president than anything else.
I‚Äôm not seeing how the politics of openness, inclusivity, and enfranchisement are connected to Trump in any way, save for the fact that Trump is has taken measures against all of those things.
The real death rate is being hidden by the trump White House.

Sigh, a ‚ÄúTrump 2.0‚Äù president is gonna beat this guy in 2024
Trump hasn‚Äôt been successful in subverting the law. The problem is much of the constitution assumed that those in office would be ethical gentlemen. Trump is neither. Even Rubio said today there will be no postponing the election.

They know nothing will come from their statement.  They are saying that now so that when trump is out they can say "we stated we disagreed with him".  CYA. Thats all it is.
Every internal move Trump is making demonstrates a real decline in popularity. And they know it.

U tell me nothing i don't know but seem unaware that  Dems are less uninformed re early treatment. Science requires open-minds. Accepting all Fauci sez on faith, &amp; accepting prevention of RX's &amp; censorship is authoritarianism. It kills people &amp; pushes independents toward Trump.

Trump talked about the re-infestation in foreign countries vs. how good we are doing in the US. You know the next step is his claims a total lockdown would have been useless.
We all expected Trump to threaten to delay the election, right? This shouldn‚Äôt come as a surprise, but it should continue to motivate us to act.
why has Trump not been given a psychological evaluation?
Not only that but all the media outlets inferred he contracted the virus after attending a Trump rally with no evidence.

To who? Putin isn't that vain. He's not going to keep Trump around as a prize.
Yes i do but I'm just saying, having biden would be the worse choive to have as president. No police, segregation may make a comeback, far more blacks in jail. You can say what you want about trump but before covid or in this the chinese virus, he was doing great

That's it in a nutshell. Putin has no loyalty to him. He drop Trump like an 80# bag of cement. And then call in all of his loans. Mar-A-Lago might be on the market sometime next year.

My man. I'm no Trump supporter. Didn't vote for him and I dont plan to. But you think he is the only one talking about the validity of our democracy? Both sides attack it as it suites them. Remember how Russia got Trump elected? Trump cant be Castro because America can't be Cuba.
If you believe in Karma, then Trump is in a lot of trouble.
The CIA committed treason. I can prove it. The FBI is just trying to do their jobs and enforce the federal law. Sad to see their probe of Trump collusion in Russia go down the drain over errors in procedure. Comey shouldn‚Äôt have been fired, bottom line. Trump tries stifling FBI
Yeah but Trump is not popular (due to his own putrid actions) surely that is more meaningful than either of those things

That *does not* mean mass ballots automatically sent to every voter. ‚ÄúUniversal‚Äù simply means it would be an OPTION for every citizen in every state, with or without needing to list a reason. Trump would still need to differentiate if that is EXPLICITLY what he‚Äôs talking about.

Trump knew about this for years, he even joked about Epstein's pedophilia. He didn't distance himself from Epstein until the property dispute.
Then, all states should have early voting &amp; there shouldn't be voting suppression. In the mist of a global pandemic people shouldn't stand in line hours on end to vote. There's no arguing that President Trump is the President of the USA.

So now we're back for circle and you understand my first take. He doesn't have to do anything at all to appeal to any of us and he can just hide. Like I said he's literally failing upwards just because Trump is so awful not because he's offering us anything to vote *for.*
Now you can't even trust the post office To deliver your mail in vote damn Republicans you are really on a roll. Remember to put your names in the history book all you scumbags who  keep supporting trump agenda. Republicans who has broken the laws of the land and covering up for
Trump‚Äôs pronouncements today about delaying elections and beehives of terrorists are only trying to grab headlines away from 150k dead from Covid, GDP contracting in Q2 at highest rate ever, and 17 million Americans out of work.
I believe it's too replace funding that went to his wall. And he wants the FBI building to stay where it is so no one builds a hotel there (across from Trump Plaza).
Trying to defend the inept DemocRATS who would not allow  the AG to answer the question?  They were there to grandstand and carry the Anti-Trump banner.
Have you tried the Demon Sperm?
Sounds like a bit ch ass KAREN to me. trump is a bit ch ass KAREN.
Trump thought he'd leave the blue states to screw themselves, as if he weren't the entire country's President!! He's violated his oath to this country. #resigninshame
Thank u 4 doing the rounds on Spanish press, I'm seeing and hearing nicaraguens and venezuelans falling 4 the same BS a lot of the older cuban generation fell for with Trump and you being a reputable republican calling it as it is really is necessary. 2 much  stake!
Oh, so you‚Äôre the Trump whisperer?  ok lol
That not new! But today his true colors came out 4all to see. His presidency was d groundwork for much of what‚Äôs happening today. He thought it would continue when HRC became President never expected Trump to win but certainly took measures just in case. Disgrace is too nice
Donald is never realizing how desperate and weak his tweets are making him look. üëÄ
Jealous.   Obama‚Äôs eulogy of Lewis went like this  He marched  Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump  He marched some more  Trump Trump Trump Trump
As Trump floats delaying election, DeSantis and Florida voting officials say there‚Äôs no need
And yet....Trump raw dogs porn stars and WW Evangelicals love him and wax poetic about his mIl order bride Melanie. Even Newt G.'s Calista did not face this level of vitriol.  It's something about HRC.  Oh yeah, she's actually intelligent and can form a coherent sentence.
I said on policy. Remember he's a status quo, corporatist, neoliberal, right-of-center politician that refuses to offer even one major concession on policy for the left who is offering old Obama era policies. You know, the neolib trash that got us a Trump in the 1st place.

What about this tho?
I‚Äôm a hate group because I hate you and trump so much
It‚Äôs literally our only hope, because unless high ranking generals come out and stand next to biden with a contingent of armed troops at his back, trump ain‚Äôt stepping down and he doesn‚Äôt care about laws or the constitution or anything else
Gilliam a pop. African American progressive entering his gubernatorial race with DeSantis and the incumbent Nelson couldn‚Äôt win in a wave midterm.  Idc what the polls say, Biden has a very steep climb for Florida. I‚Äôm a resident here and outside of South FL. It‚Äôs Trump country
I was saying this the other day... As soon as I see an American flag I automatically think they‚Äôre either racist or Trump supporters.
I love this ... trump hates this
He's wrong. How long have we been having vote by mail...not issues with widespread fraud. Now in 2020 we suddenly found out about election fraud by mail, and Trump discovered it?!! We going with that? Reach much?
You made it sound like my mention of the co-morbidity factor was off-base when it was not.  So i mentioned that. Of course not one factor. I also begged NPR to have a psychiatrist explain Trump's particular sociopathy was more like a 5 yr old's &amp; to respond to the R re hands-up.
This is being the complete lie. ü§´
Love this President Trump! Always working for the American people!
As terrible as that is, I'm still a bit more concerned with the prospect of dictator Trump than I am about the GNP.
DemoKKKrats are delusional.    NONE has said: ‚ÄúMr. President this is what we recommend, it will help‚Äù   When Trump banned flights from China they called him ‚Äúxenophobic‚Äù.  That in fact saved thousands of not millions.
If you want youth and Black voters to turn out, they have to LOVE the candidate.  No one loves Biden.  Hillary lost in 2016 in part because the Obama coalition on Black voters didn't show up.  Black voters don't hate Trump.  He is more popular now than he was in 2016.
Trump is talking about Americans here. Referring to protesters as a beehive of terrorists to be ‚Äúcleaned out.‚Äù Horrifying fascist language here.

He's literally failing upwards just bc Trump is so awful. Most people voting Joe are doing so *against* Trump, not *for* Joe or any policy. He's flavorless tofu. This is peak hostage situation. He's literally our only option and only marginally less damaging than Trump on policy.
Donald Trump messed things up so bad that people with U.S. passports literally can‚Äôt travel almost anywhere in the world.
The Federalist Society just pulled a Hamilton on Trump
Lol ! It'll be useful if working in close contact with people who can suddenly cough or project body fluids or to avoid touching the eyes . The shield protects the nose as a port of entry also.  But if social distance is ok more than 6ft none of those are necessary
Trump is a fascist and wannabe authoritarian. And I‚Äôm a proud anti fascist. He and all his cronies need to go far away and never surface again. #WhyIDontLikeTrump

Donald is trying to be distracting everyone from this:
Trump can't pronounce plasma, release my taxes, emoluments, Deutsche Bank, faithful, truth, I love my wife or Russian bounties on US soldiers. üôÑ

I think Bernie voters hate the DNC more than they hate Trump. They may look at letting Trump win as a way of breaking the DNCs back so they can take over in 2022.

18-30 voters and black voters will NOT turn out to vote for a candidate they aren't excited about. Also former Bernie Campaign staff are saying no way Bernie voters vote for Biden.  We are headed for an epic Trump rout and take back of the House. This will be huge.
I find it so ridiculous how republicans talk about voting fraud like they‚Äôre the most perfect little angels. I‚Äôm sure y‚Äôall would be committing voting fraud too just to save your lord and savior Trump

President Trump asks recovered COVID-19 patients to donate plasma -
His briefing is nauseating.  I want to throw bricks at the tv for his utterly outrageous claims of voter fraud.  Suggestion:  Since according to him an "absentee ballot" is fine, everyone needs to request one so he'll shut up.
Helmut Norpoth, a political science professor at Stony Brook University--who forecasted ‚Å¶ 2016 and has accurately predicted 25 out of 27 elections--said that Trump's reelection chances are above 90% #MAGA #mypresident
But according to Donald it is not being that big of the deal. He wants to open schools but we are unable to vote? He would have to be admitting his failure created "the emergency that is Covid." üòè

No such thing. Real conservatives love Trump.

--&gt; Horrible numbers came out today; --&gt; John Lewis was eulogized by 3 presidents; --&gt; Obama killed it. Trump didn't go and sent nobody; --&gt; Herman Cain died probably because he attended Trump's Tulsa Rally; --&gt; Repubs have no $ plan.  --&gt; trump holds a useless press conference.
I'll explain what is happening here.  No one gives a damn about Biden. No one likes Biden. No one is excited about Biden. 2/3 of the Biden vote in a recent poll were voting AGAINST Trump, not FOR Biden. 90% of Trump voters were voting FOR Trump.  If that hold, Biden loses YUGE.
He died a Trump-Ass-Kissin‚Äô fool! He undoubtedly has also infected many others! God spared him from cancer &amp; he turns around &amp; praises tRump! Cain‚Äôs very public defiance of experts &amp; his very public praise of Trump, led to his very swift &amp; unnecessary death! #TrumpIsAnIdiot
My point was we knew all sorts of reasons why ghetto &amp; crowdwed latin commun too would be hit hard from stats despite the initial surge among jet-setters. We no longer read or check anything out. Compare Zelenko 3/28 &amp; NYT 4/02 &amp; it's clear. Trump is a symptom, not just a cause

Trump's taken one question and has gone all over the place for almost 10 mins now. He couldn't pass a sobriety test.
Wallace apologized, begged for forgiveness in one of the grandest Churches in Alabama in the late 70s.  Being forthright, honest in his transgressions,and humble, he received over 90% of the African-American vote while running for governor in 1982.  Trump can‚Äôt duplicate that.
Yeah thats not the trump test. Weve been asking for rapid testing for month and he didnt do it. IN FACT he keeps taking money away from testing. 151,000 dead and counting. A competent president would have prevented most of that and used DPA for rapid tests months ago.
Trump says Nov elections might take years to resolve. Obama was not scared of elections like Trump, get ready to march to the  and demand Trump's removal. #ObamaWasBetterAtEverything
Watching Trump on TV outright lie to the citizens of the United States.  Oregon &amp;other states have been voting by mail for years.They have the data to prove it works.  I object to Trump doing a campaign speech on national TV. Biden deserves equal time to address all US citizens

Trump is setting up to nullify the November 3 Election. He‚Äôs saying it might take months and years before we find out who won. Folks, we need to hit the streets as soon as possible.
Trump says it‚Äôs totally safe to send our kids back to school.  Trump also says we should delay the election until it‚Äôs safe.  They say Trump supporters are either billionaires, or easily manipulated idiots. Check your bank account to see which one you are.

There will be no V shaped recovery. We missed the opportunity for that when things didn't close completely in Feb and tried to open too soon. Trump is a failure and the GOP is complicit in destroying the economy.

OK MAGAs get it. The GDP is the worst in history. There is no economy and if you think it's coming back soon, you are fooling yourself. Trump has decimated this economy and has no plans other than fleecing the American public. If you don't get it now, you never will. GOP failure.

Trump is scared.Trumps time in America is almost up. Maybe he can hold high office in North Korea. Maybe he can be leader of the kitchen in prison. The possibility is endless.
trump will do anything to delay the election in hopes the economy will be more favorable when the election is held. Problem is that he didn't address the virus and still hasn't, therefore there is little possibility the economy will turn that much before the election.
A common argument I hear for Trump is that he has bolstered the economy. Today's economic report emphasizes something I try to emphasize a lot to family, friends, etc. The stock market does NOT equal the economy. The stock market is fine. The economy is in the shitter.
Atop bad GDP numbers, higher than expected unemployment numbers, Senate was unable to pass relief bill. Trump is definitely deflecting attention with his election delay rhetoric.

Hello! #DONALD TRUMP STOPPED FLIGHTS FROM CHINA BEFORE ANY OTHER LEADER AND YOU CRITICISED HIM IT. THEN HE GAVE US THE cure hydroxyxhloraquine ##you like to lie.
Trump has done more to benefit USA Trade than any president since Reagan.   Trump led the USA to record low unemployment. Especially for minorities. Along with rising wages.  Trump undid much of Biden's racist Crime Bill that targeted Black Americans.
Trump Tax Cuts allowed businesses to expand and hire new workers.  More importantly his cracking down on China's unfair trade practices has created opportunities for US Businesses to create jobs.  The Trade Deals he and Lighthizer have negotiated will benefit the USA for decades.
That should strike joy into Trump‚Äôs whatever substitutes for a heart.

As I wrote earlier, we all make our own decisions on what to believe. I don‚Äôt lean toward global conspiracies. The simple answer is usually true: Trump wanted to reopen the economy for votes. GOP governors followed him. Lives are the cost of their decisions.

Charlie, all Trump does is lie, and self-aggrandize, and talk like the fascist he is.
I would call it more of a Nazi rally. You were still able to work with Nazi's even if you're on the wrong side. A lot of Trump's tactics are Nazi-like especially the past 2-3 months. Klan is just more of entitled and very narrow-minded White people.. not a real movement.
Yes. And that is why so many deaths are on Trump. If he had modeled and emphasized mask wearing and discouraged the push to reopen so fast fewer people would have died.
Imagine if the Republicans did that for the first two years of Trump, Now maybe you might want to reconsider that change? Harry Reed did it for all judges other than Supreme Court. Republicans than included the Supreme Court. How did that work out for you?
I mean he died from the virus... who cares if it's from the rally or not... honestly it's his fault as much as its Trump's fault.. you have to be a fucking idiot to go to a rally where you know most aren't smart enough to wear masks.
Trump's little crony. Did nothing to help him.
Call me crazy, but i think this is Trump coded speak for "dont worry i will keep POC out of your neighborhood."
That would be a lie. Trump IS a full blown racist.
What‚Äôs shocking is just the utter disrespect. I mean, Trump flat out told reporters ‚Äúno‚Äù he wouldn‚Äôt be going to pay respects to John Lewis.

If he got help from his gubernatorial allies... we'd end up with a situation where only Blue states vote.  That would not be the outcome Trump wants. It's possible Biden could get to 270 without the deep Red states voting. Trump digs chaos, but not chaos where he loses big.
I just asked was he a hateful person, I looked up the word in the dictionary first but I wondered why John Lewis was viewed as hateful. So I asked about Trump to see how someone could say John was hateful but Trump wasn't. Its not that complicated.
It is! Stage one was COVID19- China virus. Remember Chinese government officials net wit President Trump's administration and President Trump, before we even found out about Coronavurus.
Diane: Don't blame innocent 2020. It was as shocked as we are. You can blame it on Trump. Why not? He did everything else wrong, why not this? Although todays earthquake didn't do any damage and turn to shit as everything else he touches!
Trump‚Äôs becoming a pariah. The way his kind should be treated....instead of allowed to be President.
No joke, Trump is getting off on this - the moment he realized he could tweet praise for a different black guy who just died on the same day he planned on blowing off respect for John Lewis, I‚Äôm sure a big smug grin crossed his face and he dove for his phone.
RIP to #HermanCain who died from COVID after attending a Trump rally without a mask. Not intending this as a ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù at all, but a plea to anti-maskers to maybe reconsider the whole mask thing.
I was just seeing if the person saying one person is hateful was also capable of determining if Trump was also hateful. Its called being bias, not being able to be impartial. How does me asking a question implies hatred? Even if I was fishing for a impartial opinion?
And yet the Trump Death Cult refuses to face the implications of his death squarely and instead are doubling down on their idiotic Covid mythology and butthurt about libs being means to them.
Q: Did Herman Cain tweet that masks would not be required at Trump's controversial Tulsa rally? And was that tweet subsequently deleted?  A: Yes.
Onmy under President Trump's guidelines,  cutting red tape , in such short period of time Vaccine is in such advanced stages of Development

Amazing how you and Cain and Trump and conservatives can say whatever they want, no matter how despicable, but God forbid someone criticizes a conservative, she is labeled hateful, no matter how valid the criticism. Look in the mirror.

The  cowardice will prevent  from ever doing the right thing. They‚Äôll cheer on Trump ending elections then accuse Democrats of nonexistent voter fraud.

No, Trump and Cain are responsible for his death. Also lack of common sense. Something Republicans seem to lack since Donald Trump
Just do better. If the very real responsibility is too much for you, find another job.   The media has failed to cover Trump as he should be covered. The failure is historic and has cost lives. DO BETTER. We‚Äôre screaming because we‚Äôre dying.
You misspoke...you said Biden and you meant Trump...
Trump uses  DAILY to spread lies a/b the election, to undermine election integrity, to suppress votes, &amp; to set the stage for trying to stop or overturn the election.    need to STOP letting Trump use #Twitter to endanger elections.
Well, he call the virus a hoax and refuse to wear a mask even though underlying health conditions. What do you think?. Republican need to use their brain and common sense and not listen to a man that is dumb as rocks-Trump
Have yall noticed how TRUMP hasn‚Äôt said anything about KANYE running? ü§îNow yall knowwww ol Twitter fingers would‚Äôve had plenty to say if he wasn‚Äôt apart of this shambid #sitdownkanye
Good thing Trump had Herman Cain sign the Tulsa Rally #TrumpVirus waiver, right? This was so preventable.
Are you trying to distract from this news?? Worst GDP EVER!! E-V-E-R !!!!!  The TRUMP TOUCH (the Midas touch in reverse) doing what it does best bankrupting all it touches!!!
Every Trump is the scum at the bottom of the Barrel!
you‚Äôre so afraid that every American will actually get their chance to vote and you know it won‚Äôt be you in the end. The Trump family is the most corrupt family in American history. Every one of you are Traitors.
Trump said it is a Hoax.
Trump's desperation is palpable.
Another "winning" for Trump"
He was dancing loud &amp; proud at Trump Tulsa rally. Now he dead smh
Novel idea! That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt put my Trump sticker on my car.
Herman Cain died from corona ü¶†. I don‚Äôt want to imply that he contracted the ü¶† at Trump‚Äô Tulsa rally but he was hospitalized less than two weeks after attending ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 2020 is taking no prisoners
Herman Cain literally died for Trump.
Yes, but Trump is an accomplice
We will all miss Mr Cain! Great American! Patriot! Self-made MAN! Now, MSM/Democrats now use this tragic loss for talking points, gain political profit and against President Trump's rally. Why..to prevent Presidential debates, as they know Biden's blubbering will be a disaster!
Mr Cain was great American! Ardes supporter of Capitalism and President Trump supporter! He will be missed! MSM, Dems use this loss to promote promote political agenda: Mask were not required on Trump's rally, BUT not forbidden!

actually, the districts and electoral college helps the republicans because of gerrymandering. clinton got 2.8 million MORE votes than trump, and she still lost. and the dems ACTUALLY care about the people and districts, unlike republicans.
Cant sue the Trump campaign for it, unless he signed the NDA the Gen Z/KPOP signed onlineü§£ü§£ü§£ For rhe supporters who did not attend the rally, please express your generosity to the teenagers for saving your bloody lives from the hoax.
Absentee voting is mail in voting.. you think people are stupid. ... Well Trump supporters are stupid and unamerican for supporting a Dictator / Wannabe King. We fought a war to liberate America only to have some people wanting a monarchy?  .. #Wannabefuhrer

NOT supporting Fox or Trump or Trump JR - the point of this is to help spread the word on Big Tech's censorship.
Same guy that told us its a hoax at Trump spreader rally?
Why would a black man support Donald trump?
i agree and wish for what you said!! but how do the american people get a fair election if trump steals the ballots from blue districts??
I agree but we need to see some debates. Biden needs to go heads up with President Trump. We need to see them both answering questions that they have not read and see who really is telling the truth and who is the better man.
President Trump‚Äôs arrival on the American political scene unmasks, reveals,the loopholes in the American constitution. Am reluctant to  herald that the president is intelligent by covering which his predecessors could not discover; as a matter fact, he‚Äôs more audacious than them
Trump is suddenly talking about delaying the presidential election so you don't pay attention to this . . . This is the story you need to share, repost, and retweet. He did this, this is his virus, this is his economy   #Trumpvirus #TrumpEconomy
All trump voters please listen to your president!!!! Don‚Äôt vote on nov 3rd!!!
They are paid to post these things no good person voting for trump
You are correct, I misspoke, there should be criticism of a choice of such a polarizing figure just as I would expect criticism of Trump if he had chosen David Duke as his running mate and I would be the first to do so. My point is the ultimate arbiter is your vote.
Donald J. Trump
.He can say what he wants...he does anyway...most of the words do not make sense...others are just stupidity....We vote in November....  Trump Suggests Unprecedented Delay to November Election ‚Äî But Congress Sets the Date
Even if Donald Trump tries to stop the Presidential Election, states would still be able to hold their primary elections. Even if they dont, the states Governor of Cal would be in a place to appoint a interim until the election and Pelosi would likely remain as interim

UNDENIABLY, Empirical Evidence is the bedrock of Irrefutable Fact and Trump has been a liar his entire adult life causing his track record to prove he simply can‚Äôt be trusted  SAFETY 1stüí• IT‚ÄôS JUST TOO RISKY TO ALLOW TRUMP TO PROTECT OUR RIGHTS &amp; WELL-BEING FOR FOUR MORE YEARS‚ÄºÔ∏è
So instead of entertaining an idea as absurd as Trump unilaterally delaying an election, something which there is no mechanism for him to do, let‚Äôs instead worry about how we‚Äôre going to hold that election in the middle of a pandemic.
The question is not whether we will have an election on November 3rd. It‚Äôs whether or not Trump is able to sow enough chaos to squeak out a win. At best, what he‚Äôs doing now is just him trying to delegitimize Biden‚Äôs victory, not actually delay an election.
I know it can feel like Trump can do anything sometimes, but he can‚Äôt. He is repeatedly stopped in the courts, by congress, and by his own ineptitude. The only stuff he does get away with is stuff that involves Senate Republicans or his own cronies.
Then January 20th arrives. California held its elections so Pelosi is re-elected. Trump is constitutionally forced to leave. The Roberts court will deny any challenges because it‚Äôs CLEARLY SPELLED OUT. Pelosi is sworn in. Trump is kicked out by the secret service.
Most of the illegal shit Trump‚Äôs done has been confined to things the toadies in his own administration are willing to do. In order to delay the election WITHOUT congressional approval, he‚Äôs going to need to be able to simply declare ‚Äúelection‚Äôs off,‚Äù and...
Alright, genuine question: what mechanism is Trump going to use to delay the 2020 election?
TRUMP supporters are now saying Dems created this virus to make him look bad  and once he‚Äôs gone it will miraculously disappear!  Another great reason to vote Joe folks.
Interesting how Trump thinks we can‚Äôt have a safe election under Covid, but we can send our children back to school. #DumpTrump2020 #BlackLivesMatter #freeandfairelections

Yay, Fox and Limbaugh and friends!! Got you hooked on some major nonsense. China was ‚Äúpropagated‚Äù?? How has Trump dealt with Russia for 4 yrs?? The ‚Äúpallets of cash‚Äù thing is pure propaganda. Isis, North Korea comments are just silly.
Your Trump interview was pathetic.
So, those people who voted for Trump because "He tells it like it is," how are you feeling about his tweets and speeches?
Trump has a schedule?
Barr did not know that legally Trump cannot change the election date. Why didn't he know something so basic? Isn't he the AG?
Trump always plays right into Putin‚Äôs hands.
So many of us are on to Trump. He‚Äôs so transparent.
Trump, you are the biggest asshole to ever run this country.  Bitch be be gone.  You are the virus that effects us.
Trump Says-  I Think He's A Little OFF when he says "The Younger" are Immune or LESS at Risk to Contract the Corona Virus"  I Think Anyone Born Between 1960/65 to 1990/95 Developed A Tough Immune System based on Those Times they Lived In &amp; Things that They had to deal with!   ???
I could only listen to #Trump for a few minutes.  He is playing the victim role right now. He is experiencing severe #NarcissisticInjury.  He is depressed, paranoid and delusional.  In my opionion, this is dangerous. I am concerned about his state of mind and what he may do.
Completely unbelievable. A desperate Trump is a dangerous Trump and we're getting nowhere with this guy.
Keep in mind that Marv and Trump were often at odds over hotels and casinos.

Trump shutting up is a plan I am down for!

Even worse--he said "it would be an embarrassment to the US" when everyone knows that Trump is the GREATEST embarrassment to the US.

Mr. Rather, traditions of Presidential behavior Trump violated were hard won and too easily lost.  He has permanently damaged the Union because under similar circumstances good men/women will fail to protect the Union.  Only Divine Providence can hold the Union together now.
That poor family is being used as Trump-props. He's not going to get to the bottom of anything. He is incompetent-- non compos mentis.
Well, Donald J Trump did get impeached because he was scared that Joe Biden would win the Presidency in 2020.ü§£
Help me here. I don't understand the concept of Maga. Trump has been president for more than 3 years now. Does the slogan has to be something like keep America great ? If greatness has not be achieved in last 3+ years, how he will achieve in next 4 years. I am not mocking.
Just read what Trump tweeted .If it‚Äôs not safe to vote until January 2021 then the $600/week should be extended until January 2021.

I feel no guilt in saying I have zero remorse for these people.  They encouraged millions to risk their lives to please Trump, and they led by example. Their deaths should serve as an example, too.  This is not a thing I would have said four years ago. Blame Trump &amp; his enablers.
Should we do a Go-Fund-Me for the post office?   Trump has made us a pathetic country.
Which is why it was a lovely service. Nobody needs Donald Trump. We need a real president.
Trump you are the biggest fraud of a president this nation has ever seen.  You will pay big time for it.
WTF... That was the scariest thing I have seen.
And now Trump says he feels bad about his friend
What do I do with my Trump supporting son who tells me its not the governments responsibility to keep people safe??!?
Why sir are you concerned about mail in fraud? You have not been concerned about what your Senate intelligence Committee found with Russian involvement in the 2016 election in favor of Your golfing buddy Trump.

Dear Trump Fans,  1. There is not a person on this earth that is ‚Äútrying to abolish American energy.‚Äù That is a fact so why is he saying that?? 2. No one is going to suddenly ‚Äútake away all you guns!‚Äù Maybe some better control but that is all. Fake Fears help none of us.
Trump should shut them down
President Obama is currently speaking at John Lewis‚Äô memorial. I bet Trump is holding his impromptu press conference at the White House to try and change the narrative back to him.  He‚Äôs so childish.
If the trend is your friend ... The trump notion of delaying The election ... would mean the Donald‚Äôs numbers will keep going down ... and the GOP with him
The trading volume was through the roof on Monday, the day before Trump's announcement. Insider trading palooza.
No one is praising his death. I put this on Trump for holding a stupid rally with no masks. Now people will suffer. How many more have to die? WEAR A MASK! R.I.P. Herman.
Hahahahaha. He knows Trump better than the people who support Trump, a vast majority of whom are outright saps, marks...
I didn‚Äôt watch it because Barr is a liar.  Thanks for this. We know he is a white supremacist just like tRump !   üíôüíôüí™üèºüí™üèº
We need to end the debt ceiling, end government shutdowns, do more to bolster the Justice Department‚Äôs independence, abolish ICE, put new limits on executive power...  The GOP found so many ways to sabatoge Obama and enable Trump, and we can‚Äôt let that go on.
Looks like Dr Birx gave up trying to somehow educate Trump and is speaking truth to America. Late, but better than never. It will be interesting to see if Trump throws her under the same bus as he has thrown Fauci.
On one hand, Trump‚Äôs crimes are so many and so blatant, it‚Äôs hard to imagine them being ignored.  But I‚Äôll bet it‚Äôs also awfully tempting to just do what they did with Bush, and just focus on the legislative agenda.  And even there we probably won‚Äôt do enough.
I am afraid Trump will try to use "emergency powers" to force a delay in the election. We must be prepared for that eventuality.
Pelosi and Reid let Bush skate because they thought impeachment would be an electoral loser. When Obama won, no effort was made to punish members of the Bush administration for 8 years of lies and gross incompetence.  Trump already forced Pelosi to impeach, but will they do more?
My biggest fear is Trump somehow pulling out a win in November.  My second biggest fear is Democrats not being willing to do enough to repair all the damage when they‚Äôre back in power.  I am a proud Democrat, but one thing I‚Äôll never forget or forgive is how they dealt with Bush.
Unfortunately, we have consistently seen Trump stomping our laws and the Constitution.  Constant Impunity and refusing to follow subpoenas &amp; ignoring Supreme Court directives. Trump lawsuits have been his tactics for years. No service done minimizing danger from Trump &amp; Co.

This is sad. One line of thought is that he brought it on himself and endangered others. His, at best, naivete that led to his demise in a little over a month is still tragic. Responsible leadership from Donald Trump would go a long way to prevent unnecessary death
Want to live in a free speech free life free country? Then vote TRUMP, VOTE REPUBLICAN all the way otherwise turn Socialist then somewhat communistic very shortly thereafter!!! Just you watch and I don‚Äôt get paid for this either
Before people freak out:  No, Trump can‚Äôt actually delay the election. Only an act of congress can.  He floats dumb shit like this literally all the time cuz he has the impulse control of a toddler.  He constitutionally HAS to leave office on January 20 without an election.

Trump's truth is that he works for Putin. The damage he will do between now and next January 20th is inestimable.
Wait I thought this was trumps America at the moment? Under economic chaos, racial tensions higher than ever, national debt rising more then ever and hundreds of thousands dead... yeah that‚Äôs pretty much trump burning down America.

Biden represents exactly how we got here, and why people flung so far the the other side to put Trump in lol  Trump is a symptom and his failures&amp; successes just point out all the failings and lack of efficiency in the system we were trying to keep from crumbling/taking advantage
Reps/Trump have packed the SC already. We have to pray the RGB remains healthy enough to stay until after the Presidential election is finalized, and that the Dems win decisively. Otherwise we have lost our democracy
He's going whine about this at his next briefing.   Because as we all know NOBODY is LESS RACIST than Donald Trump and MAGA loves the blacks!üòèü§°ü§£üòé

Hey guys, the economy contracted by 33% in the 2nd quarter. An unheard of number even in the worst economies in history. Trump's depends on the myth of "his good economy" holding up. So he flashes the shiniest object imaginable and the press and social media run with it all day.

Ignorance is not bliss. Why would anyone stand up for the failure and anti American  Trump?

Hey  I've heard Joe Biden being referred to as a "puppet" many times. Maybe your father should consider changing his nickname from "Sleepy Joe" to "Puppet Joe". God bless the Trump Train!!
The most powerful people in the world hate  and that's enough reason alone for everyone that trusts the working man, truth, and the American way to put your lives in Trump's hands.
Glad to see Trump didn't attend that over hyped talent show for Lewis today.  If you don't like someone when they are alive... don't be a douche bag and pretend you like them when they are dead. #JohnLewisMemorial
No, there's more.
McConnell and other top Republican officials rebuff Trump suggestion to delay the Nov. 3 election - The Washington Post. He‚Äôs a clear and present danger to our democracy. Remove him!

As a #Democrat, I am here to say that we must bring our party back to our core values to defeat Trump and the rise of extremism. We need to be of, by, and for the people. We need #DownBallotProgressives who advocate for people not corporate donors.
Trump floats November election delay, but it won't happen
Mailing ballots are not a problem.  Look, we get our passports by mail, government checks by mail, drivers licenses by mail.  Mailing ballots only became an issue because Trump decided to make it one.
Must be watch TV and tweet time on the Presidents schedule. All the other living past presidents will be honoring a man at his funeral. Trump must be beside himself!
The science has been all over the place.  Is Trump a scientist or do you think he listens to the scientists around him?  Your TDS makes you stupid.
Thank you for proving again that he didn't call the virus a hoax.  February 28th we had no idea about this virus.  Pelosi was telling people to go to China Town.  Cuomo was telling people to go to the movies.  Trump was implementing travel bans.  Wake up.
Hope it‚Äôs true üòé..it would give Trump the election in November on a silver platter..üëèüëèüëèüëèüá∫üá∏üòé
Stupid tricks get stupid prizes.  People do dumb shit all the time.  Can't blame Trump for people's stupidity.
This claim has been thoroughly debunked, yet TDS idiots like you keep pushing it. Trump referred to the Dems politicking on the virus as a hoax, not the virus itself.
Do you realize that Herman was a grown man capable of making his own decisions?  President Trump didn't ban mask wearing.  Do you people need government to tell you what to do every step of the way in your life or are you capable of making your own decisions?

Yea and I‚Äôm sure the 8 Trump campaign staffers who contracted COVID shortly after the Tulsa Rally must‚Äôve gotten it from somewhere else too. Regardless I guarantee that he and those around him did not wear masks or take the virus seriously which still makes it ironic and foolish

Pick whatever metric you want. Even before the crash obama outpaced trump on jobs added by a wide margin. Trump will be the first president since hoover to lose more jobs than gained. LOL! IS IT GREAT YET?!?!?!?!?
Literally the only guy trump nominated that isn't a complete fool
Old ways are hard to break. Every old "BS" way exposed gets President Trump more and more American Constitutional votersüëçü¶Öüá∫üá∏üóΩ
I‚Äôm voting for President Trump no matter what! You? KEEP IT GOING!
‚ÄúNobody likes me‚Äù declares Trump. I wonder why? Of course there are 140,000 reasons why. He has proven time and time again he is unethical, self-aggrandizing, lies perpetually for no reason and has no compassion or empathy for ‚Äúaverage working Americans‚Äù. I guess he is right.
From Sept. 19th 2019 - President Trump speaks at the United Nations event on religious freedom
I thought CNN said~ Trump was so WRONG about hydroxychloroquine.  Banning  would be the ethical thing to do for  but then again I used the word "Ethical" and  lacks that.
The long list of Donald Trump's pro-life accomplishments  via   My recent interview with our friends at  who do a much better job than most of the #Catholic media who try to imply that I am somehow out of step with the church. #FakeNews
Remember when CNN hated Trump for saying exactly this?  #FakeNews

We're on a Gamble. What happens after 2024 and no more Trump? Dr Sanjay Gupta, American neurosurgeon, medical reporter, writer for President. Brain salad surgery!  Science can never  trump mother nature! The Earth can shake us off like fleas.
Ok, this is pretty sick stuff. Why are so many people blind and deaf. Don‚Äôt blame it on the virus either. Trump has been doing this for 4 years now long before the virus struck.
One of the most vocal received her license last November. Trump University do doubt.
We all know that you are the "challenged" Trump so I will say it slowly: It isn't censorship unless it's done by the government. Twitter is allowed to enforce their own TOS.

The long list of President Trump‚Äôs pro-life accomplishments | Blogs | LifeSite
I faxed #Catholic parishes today informing them that our  broadcasts will air speeches from Pres Trump daily, like at the UN, NASA, Warsaw. A Deacon writes back that it‚Äôs ‚Äúblatant and unadulterated partisan politics‚Äù. Wake up! It‚Äôs called democracy! ü§îüôÑ
Fred Trump was sued, the DOJ investigated, sent in undercover black operatives, and they learned that the Trumps don't discriminate against blacks, and the CASE WAS DROPPED.  No allegations were ever made against Donald Trump.  Court documents are facts you should refer to.
You're changing what Trump said, that's another form lying.  Be honest and accurate when you hate because it makes you look dumb when you lie about what someone said when what they said is on YouTube all day.
Trump did not say Mexicans... He said Mexico is not sending their best people.  They are sending rapist...bla bla bla, and   guess some are good people.  If you're going to hate be accurate while you hate.
YEAP - They sued Trump for not renting to black people.  If you were smart you would know it wasn't Donald Trump who got sued.  But simple people don't need to hear the whole story.
YEAH, married to a black lady and my son is Latino and he's married to a Filipina and they're all Trump supporters and they're all called racists by hateful stupid people.   My parents are racists, but their Trump hating Democrats so I expect that out of them.
I can't find one person who calls Trump a racist capable of providing evidence that Trump is a racist.  Even the comments about the "fascist playbook" sounds stupid because there is no such "playbook."  Do you have any critical thinking skills?  No?  I didn't think so.
Critical Thinkers identify #FakeJournalists &amp; #FakeNews by headlines alone~ "Trump reportedly made unexpected first pitch announcement out of irritation with Fauci"  Only Trump knows if he was irritated; not the #FakeJournalist who can't report the fact without a biased barb.
Totally agree. At 71, I have lived through good and bad times. Trump promised a lot. He delivered huge tax cuts for the wealthy. We now have record deficits and find ourselves fighting for our health. No plan for Healthcare during a pandemic is not forgivable.

There continues to be a sentiment that somewhere- somehow there is a Genie in Trump‚Äôs lamp. The more people rub, they find out they just get worn out trying. There is no Genie or magic that suddenly makes him more intelligent, thoughtful, kind, empathetic, honest or trustworthy.
With Trump there is always a Tweet or a video that reflects his true nature. He has always been a racist. His father was one too. The fact that he loves to hear himself talk gives all of us a window into his true nature. Just listen to his words.

#COVID Well! What if what is happening is exactly what Trump‚Äôs boss wants? Putin‚Äôs plans for America is progressing beyond all his wildest expectations. Trump and the GOP are deliberately crippling the nation and we may not survive.
3+ years later, the ‚ÄúGreat Pumpkin Audit in the Sky‚Äù is no closer. How gullible are his supporters to think Trump ever intended to allow anyone to see and unravel his house of cards? Pay no taxes; too bad we all can‚Äôt get that break.
President Trump should give you an award for increasing people's IQ from 69 to 72.
The left supports criminals they would love to see chaos all through the United States  they just can't wait to see people's homes invaded. They cannot take control. And innocent people will die .           'a lot of bloodshed' against Trump supporters
If the debates were good policy debate, which is impossible with trump btw because he doesn‚Äôt know how our government even works, they would get bad rating and most people wouldn‚Äôt even understand or care. It‚Äôs a shittty popularity contest
I agree, the 2016 debates were turned into a clown show and they haven‚Äôt had real policy debate in a long long time. Trump turned the whole thing into a reality tv show on top of the declining quality of them. I blame the audience, us, on not holding any standards
Why won‚Äôt President Trump attend Lewis viewing????
I don't follow Trump anymore. I have repented for my sins...
Ok Ok the people have spoken I just unfollowed Trump! I thought with 25+ years of well documented Liberal activism it was no big deal if I got President Pinesol's tweets live  But being relatively new to Twitter ( 7 months ) I figured it was no biggie, apparently not. I hear you
Viral Tweet of the Week. Do you buy President Trump merchandise online?   If it comes damaged this might be why.
1. I listened to Dr. Kynan Bridges video. President Trump was put in his position to protect all Christian values.  2. I took an oath to protect the Constitution. POTUS is not trying to destroy it  3. No way in hell I'll be a communist  like the democraps.
How does Trump both suck n' blow at the same time
President Trump addresses the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 24 2019
So sick of the #fakenews coverage even within #Catholic Media.  I help the Trump Campaign in an unofficial capacity.   As an obedient priest, I follow Church law not to have an official title in the campaign.  But media report on it as if I‚Äôm distancing myself from Trump.  Unfair
If you are paying attention, you would know that it was Trump's intelligence (FBI, DOJ, CIA) were colluding to overthrow him--first time in American history.  Durham is investigating and charges against Comey, McCabe, Rosenstein, Strozk coming soon.
I spent 20+ years in uniform (USASOC) and have a rating too, now work for DOD; I'm not impressed.  I asked you a simple question and you can't defend your childish hate of the POTUS with facts.  The media lies about Trump nonstop programming simple minded people like you to hate
This is emblematic of Trump‚Äôs Presidency. A grifter who promised a Great Wall that would be paid for by Mexico. Americans instead get a piece of crap paid for by shifting funds from needed Congressionally approved military projects. Typical of Trump.
From Gandhi, MLK to Congressman Lewis, peaceful and persistent protest wins in the face of tyranny. Americans have a Constitutional right to redress their government and a willingness to stand up. Vote out Trump and those that have enabled him to divide us.
I follow both. I follow Trump to be able to mock him in real time. Look in my timeline just yesterday and you'll see me pleading with people to follow Joe. My posts and retweets are 100% anti-trump So please don't think just because we follow Trump that we support him in anyway!
FL - hoping the ‚Äúhidden‚Äù Trump supporters get out and vote as I suspect they will. If that happens, by midnight Election Day all the prognosticators will be out of business for another 4 years.....
Twitter definitely provides a new definition into the minds of the common Joe Smo.  Just ponder on how many of these clowns have voting rights that will affect your kids grand kids?  Trump The Trunk needs to tighten up the voting regs after his re election.
Our government under Trump is out of control. It is operating with no regard for the Constitution or Democratic principals. We are not Russia or China. We vote and we can see where 3 1/2 years of Trumpism has brought us. Trillions in more debt, over 140k dead.
Damn Straight. I hear Trump's favorite Country Norway is hiring entry level morons
lol.. Trump the Trunk 2020.  Dont loose any sleepover Joe the Smo Biden. He wishes he could hold a candle to you.
His name is Louis DeJoy and he wasn't elected, he was appointed by Trump to slow the mail down.  He is a big Trump donor.  But yes, we need to keep our eyes on him
This is exactly why all Americans should let their voices be heard and vote. That way, when Trump loses there will be no question as to what we thought of the ‚ÄúTrumpism Experiment‚Äù.
Yes, Trump actually woke up and realized his ‚Äúbase‚Äù can‚Äôt win him another election. His malfeasance and inability to unite our nation is just too much for the majority of voters to accept. Vote Blue to begin to mend our Democracy.
Exactly. Trump will blame anything and everything for his loss, stirring up hate and violence

I‚Äôm curious if you get days off? Not defending anyone here, but it seems like you‚Äôre upset because Trump did something for a few hours on a weekend. Do you do anything in your weekends or days off?
Reinstituting the taxes on the ultra rich and corporations as they were prior to 2017 would be a good first step. Trump has presided over the largest budget deficits in our history. He reduced taxes and increased spending- no plan for sustainability.
I WILL VOTE TRUMP because Joe has to select someone named TOKEN to be his VP, because Joe supports Socialism and Lawlessness, and because of this video which every American should view twice-
After weeks of protests,Portland had settled into a more manageable routine with less real property damage and no injuries. Then came Trump‚Äôs stormtroopers. Secretive police, strong arm tactics and injuries as protests grew exponentially. Trump spawns division and chaos.
What impact, scratch that, what POSITIVE impact comes from insulting hundreds of thousands even millions of American veterans and their familes? NONE, Americans &amp; non vets who support our country must support Trump or Dems lose to the DICTATORS. They are already control too much!
‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs America is a plague state, wracked by illness and disease. Trump‚Äôs America is an economic trainwreck. It‚Äôs a society whose social bonds have been blown apart by hate and brutality and selfishness.

Speak the hell up, Carlos.  Do you want the world‚Äôs leading terrorists still alive and well and plotting terrorism against you and your loved ones? That‚Äôs Biden. Do you want them dead? Like they are now? That‚Äôs Trump.
Speak up, Carlos. Do you want open borders so the criminals can come in and attack your community? That‚Äôs Biden. Do you want security at our nation‚Äòs borders in at the same time warmly and safely welcoming immigrants? That‚Äôs Trump.
Do you want to start, Carlos? So let‚Äôs start. How many babies do you want to see dismembered and decapitated? That‚Äôs Biden Or how many babies do you want to see protected? That‚Äôs Trump

Unimaginable irony of Trump‚Äôs claims about law and order while the nation is morning the death of Congressman Lewis. Mr. Lewis is recognized for his work on Civil Rights. He protested in the streets and was beaten and arrested many times. Yet, he is now revered as a true HERO.
How many aides has Trump banged on that hollowed desk?? Sickening
Nothing brings people together more than a common cause In our case it's racism, intolerance, greed, cruelty, murder n' mass incarceration of minorities especially blacks, and F*CKING TRUMP'S GOTTA GO......
Trump is incapable of uniting a diverse nation like America. His attempts at recasting himself as a ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù candidate, is ill conceived and destined to fail. He is taking advice from the absolute worst people. Miller and Bannon make no attempt to hide their racist agenda.
Trump has made it clear that he doesn‚Äôt want a free press. He sees himself as a all knowing and powerful leader that is above all this ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù stuff.

Can‚Äôt wait to see what new crap he has in store. Trump is so obsessed with the past that he can‚Äôt see or plan for what‚Äôs ahead.
When he no longer has a job with the Trump Administration after January, I am sure he can make some bucks as a used car salesman on TV. He has the moves down.

Where‚Äôd those libertarians go? They were so outraged at Obama for saving the car industry and now trump is shelling out trillions, deploying federal police around the country, and has ballooned the size of the government by a significant number. Wonder what happened?
Donald trump has been a fraud and con man for 70 plus years. Is banned from running a charity because of self dealing, he had to pay 25 million dollars for running a fraudulent university. He had 70 years to not be a conman fraud, why do you think that will change?
He got subpoena to testify to Congress. So he's hiding up Trump ass, with Pence n' Pompeo.
She's hanging on by a thread. Both sides hate her. But we hate her more for voting with Trump 99%

#Republicans #COVID #COVIDKILLERS. Remember GOP accusations that Obama would have DEATH PANELS deciding who would live or die. Welcome to GOP reality. Trump death panels in Texas. TRUMP failures gives US real death panels and the Republican Senate is aiding and abetting him.
Trump is just like the captain of the Titanic. Both stayed in denial until the water was up to their waists. Then they finally took action to help the rich while the poor stayed locked down &amp; slowly died

This may actually be the linchpin for the end of Trump‚Äôs presidency. It‚Äôs a sign of desperation and a total lack of historical perspective. Other President‚Äôs that were failing have tried to show force in the face of social change and ended up being rolled over in the process.
I thought these briefings were canceled in the first place because it makes Trump look incompetent, self-centered, and petty. Without doctors and other professionals giving actual useful information, these briefings are no more than a diatribe. On second thought, why stop now?

Can we talk about important things without lying?  1. Joe Biden's dementia is a very real problem and we should address now rather than with the 25th Amendment  2. The attempted overthrow of the Office of the POTUS  3. Why news agencies lie about Trump

Obama used the politics that Lewis lived for in his eulogy which is deeply appropriate and seems to be what Lewis would have done. If people see that waving the banner of voting rights as anti-trump‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ I think that might say more about the president than anything else.

This is actual Brownshirt shit. Building dossiers on journalists as though they are criminals. This is the end-run result of Trump calling the press the ‚Äúenemy of the people.‚Äù
Lmao now this is about trump? Girl just say you hate Nicki and call it a day.
The Constitutional Case Against Trump‚Äôs Use of the Department of Homeland Security is going to be a hot messy process
This is actually a very dishonest tweet. There is no proof Hermain Cain got the virus from his rally, its all speculation. Not, only that but to say Trump, "made wearing a mask political" is bullshit. The media made this all political from the get go!! not Trump. Be honest dude
No, your administration has been focused on advertising pizza places while 150,000 Americans have died...
We all got a chance to ur guy Trump make a fool of himself
Some of them are dying of Corona Virus because they follow the advice of dumb people like Mr. Trump!
Vote Trump!  Don't forget the 3 strikes you're out policy by Clinton which created insane levels of black incarceration!
we tried to deface a ‚Äútrump 2020‚Äù graffiti by writing ‚Äúsucks‚Äù over the 2020 but we didn‚Äôt do it dark enough cuz ppl were coming so now it looks like it says TRUMP SOCKS
The Trump Family is known for their NDA‚Äôs and that should not count
Trump's hunger to lie more is never satiated.
Maduro is asking me to tell you if you can build something that float like a raft with a sail so you can sail from the us to Venezuela...you could refuel in cuba and keep sailing down here. Bu hurry up b4 Trump the dictator put you in jail
Trump 2020!
Trump is so jealous b/c he knows he will never be  As respected as they are. Not even close.
Your state is losing 100‚Äôs if people a day and you are doing nothing but ignoring it.  We all see you.  You are world famous #DeathSantis and there is a sod isl place waiting for you in hell, right next to Trump #GOPGenocide
No we need both you and Trump to go bye bye
Thought trump was god
I must say Trump managed to change the subject from the serious unemployment situation and the worst GDP in history.
The plan for autocracy is set in motion...
Trump‚Äôs smile better than mine üòÇ
The podium stood erect as Obama trash üóë talked President Trump and Obama contemplation private pillow talk with John Lewis , even the casket edged up. Soul mates no pun
Kodak is switching to produce drug ingredients and received a multimillion dollar loan from the Trump administration
Trump is not a hipocrat,  remember how Mr.lewis behave during the inauguration, never recognized his victory,  and boycott the event. ....plus the impeachment, hard to forget too.
All after trump‚Äôs executive order authorizing #NoVisaRequiredTravel to and from Poland!!! üáµüá±   Now, we have FACELESS THUGS, THAT DO NOT SPEAK AND CANNOT BE IDENTIFIED, ROAMING OUR STREETS.   Gee, I wonder why?
#BLMprotest ran up to the last election and then immediately disappeared after #Trump was elected. Now that he is up for re-election we have protests again that will also immediately end once the election is over. Can you all see the puppets hand in the sock? I can. #blm.
Biden was giving a hypothetical, knowing Trump will do whatever he can to ‚Äúfix‚Äù the election. Trump, if he could, would actually do it!!
With out Trump this country will be another Venezuela
Let's track the Trump $$ some more. $600K seems small beans compared to what we can find on
He‚Äôd use the loss of his family to manipulate potential donors into contributing to Trump. #DeSantisResignNow
And BTW Kim, did you ever get the money Parscale owed you for promoting Trump, because it‚Äôs not like you do this because you truly want him to win, right Kim?  The only way you‚Äôll promote him is if he pays you to promote him.
Not Biden, his handlers will refuse to debate Trump. They have been looking for a way out. That's why they keep him in the baseman.
People, the owners of  are not Americans, they came from Australia 25 years ago to fuck us up, and spread colonial racism in our country, not to mention lies and Pandemic misinformation, without them, no Trump presidency, and no 150,000 people dead #DyingForTrump
--&gt; Horrible numbers came out today --&gt; John Lewis was eulogized by 3 presidents. --&gt; Obama killed it. Trump didn't go. Sent nobody.  --&gt; Herman Cain died prob because he attended Trump's Tulsa Rally. --&gt; Repubs have no $ plan.  ... &amp; trump diverts by trying to postpone election.
Trump isn't the one who's setting crime records in Chicago, and he's not the one causing the civil unrest. That was your MAYOR! Might want to ask her why she hates our country.
I think it's much more likely that Trump is not actually engaged in the struggle that the Qanon people think he is.  Powerful pedophiles exist, in almost every major institution worldwide, but Trump isn't fighting them.
Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That‚Äôs Unconstitutional.  #unconstitutional
Isn‚Äôt it sad that Trump had NICER things to say about Herman Cain than he did John Lewis?
When Trump wins re-election with mail in ballots, will the opposition question the integrity of the election? Anyone who says no is either ignorant or intellectually dishonest.
Funny how tRump learned so much about the minutiae of the entire nation‚Äôs voting systems just by trailing in the polls.
U tell me nothing i don't know but seem unaware that  Dems are less uninformed re early treatment. Science requires open-minds. Accepting all Fauci sez on faith, &amp; accepting prevention of RX's &amp; censorship is authoritarianism. It kills people &amp; pushes independents toward Trump.
‚ÄúWe are closing all doors.‚Äù The Trump administration goes after Cuban bank in London.
Doctors stand behind President Trump, call for reopening America thanks ...  via
Almost $3T in Trump's 4 years.
1,529 people died today in the United States due to COVID-19 and we had 70k new cases.  That‚Äôs the highest number of deaths recorded since May 14th.  Trump‚Äôs incompetence is killing thousands of people.
Russians really don't like Putin. They follow him hoping for scraps. And they hate Trump. They think he's a fucking clown like we do And having Trump around would only intensify that.   No Russia is a trailer park with nuclear weapons.
Lol? I criticize Trump on the daily. Shut the hell up. It has nothing to do with gender.
Because it‚Äôs all about Trump. Never mind that Barron won‚Äôt be going to brick and mortar school come September, but we have to send all our kids?!?!  #TrumpHatesScience #TrumpKillsAmericans   üëáüèºüëáüèºüëáüèºüëáüèºüëáüèºüëáüèºüëáüèºüëáüèºüëáüèºüëáüèº
Don‚Äôt trust them. Don‚Äôt ever. But if they collectively abandon Trump it‚Äôs lights out at Trump campaign HQ. Like there‚Äôs no money and no point to continue.
Trump talked about the re-infestation in foreign countries vs. how good we are doing in the US. You know the next step is his claims a total lockdown would have been useless.
We all expected Trump to threaten to delay the election, right? This shouldn‚Äôt come as a surprise, but it should continue to motivate us to act.
why has Trump not been given a psychological evaluation?
Not only that but all the media outlets inferred he contracted the virus after attending a Trump rally with no evidence.
Trump doesn‚Äôt joke, even when he‚Äôs making fun of people. Have you ever even seen him laugh?
According to MSM Trump reneged on delaying the Election! All of America is on his ass!
No shjt. You Republicans still don‚Äôt get Trump do you.   He did it so democrats would say people can get out and vote
And dems so shocked that Trump is concerned.   Amazing.   4 LA men admit to Skid Row voter-fraud scheme, DA announces
Oh, they will be. Then you'll find just how much of a shell game the Trump empire really was. I'm betting he actually worth from 5 to 10% of what he says. Everything else is leveraged up the heinie.
Best mask ever! #trump #mask #virus #coronavirus
I‚Äôd vote for Mickey Mouse before I vote for Trump.
#ObamaWasBetterAtEverything Obama had some smooth BS . Likeable on the surface which Trump really isn‚Äôt good at . Policy wise. No comparison
Madness. How convenient.. there‚Äôs a new post master that was hired by the trump administration..
His "Secret Service" isn't going to get near him with the actual USSS puting up a fight. And Park Police (uniformed USSS agents). And the US Marshals. And DC Police. And that's all before the military get to the scene.  Trump ain't got the stones to put up a fight.
You know Obama is a criminal, and the entire left has been filling people minds with lies about Trump. You're just a sad case of TDS! You also know John Lewis was a racist himself, and he did NOTHING for his city. Period but make himself rich.
To who? Putin isn't that vain. He's not going to keep Trump around as a prize.
Yes i do but I'm just saying, having biden would be the worse choive to have as president. No police, segregation may make a comeback, far more blacks in jail. You can say what you want about trump but before covid or in this the chinese virus, he was doing great
Republicans flat-out reject Trump‚Äôs suggestion to delay election  via
If he did, then why wouldn't he say so? Trump seems to say everything that's on his mind.
Yea i feel you Trump is a racist apologist at best. But he can think all he wants. Our checks and balances are too solid. Cuba was easy pickings with so many living in dier circumstances. I miss BO...I'm getting nostalgic lol
That's it in a nutshell. Putin has no loyalty to him. He drop Trump like an 80# bag of cement. And then call in all of his loans. Mar-A-Lago might be on the market sometime next year.
trump visit KODK fact. KODK secured loan to produce pharmaceuticals(hydroclorowhatever). stock then quadruples. Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt see these drugs are just money in they pockets.
Dear white supremacist Nazi, the  is coming for you in 2021, you are only out of jail because of Trump, when he's gone, so will you.
God bless United States of America and our President Donal Trump

Yeah no I can tell you‚Äôre not a Trump supporter lol. Yes, there are many individuals on both sides of the spectrum whom are a danger to our democracy. It‚Äôs been known that there was voter fraud in the 2016 election. American laws will never be like Cuba, however, we have a...
Trump defends tweet on possible Election Day delay at contentious press conference -
I caught Obama talking as I walked by the TV today and I wondered what political event he was speaking at. Then I realized it was a funeral. And they say Trump is classless.
Trump will deport them in due time. When you enable Nazis they always wind up turning on you eventually.
No, there‚Äôs no praising them. But it might be a signal to all the conservative judges that they aren‚Äôt obligated to support Trump.
My man. I'm no Trump supporter. Didn't vote for him and I dont plan to. But you think he is the only one talking about the validity of our democracy? Both sides attack it as it suites them. Remember how Russia got Trump elected? Trump cant be Castro because America can't be Cuba.
If you believe in Karma, then Trump is in a lot of trouble.
Yeah but Trump is not popular (due to his own putrid actions) surely that is more meaningful than either of those things
Fuck Covid and fuck Donald Trump.
Obama had people entering illegally in cages. Trump terminated that practice. My family came to the US legally even though it cost my grandfather 3 years working at a labor camp in Cuba basically a slave in order to do so. You just have no idea how bad it is in other places
BASKETBALL IS BACK  Also Donald Trump is a White Supremicist, full stop!
LMAO "trump next to a black person". OMG.
What reason would u have for voting for Trump unless you are racist?  Voting republican? They are destroying us.
CBC in full deflection spin by painting Trump as a madman and with  Trudeau as an innocent victim...
I can't wait till  holds those who support trump's murderous, corrupt regime accountable.  We can't allow allies oppressive dictators walk free in the US.   for Attorney General!!!!!!  You are killing us!
That *does not* mean mass ballots automatically sent to every voter. ‚ÄúUniversal‚Äù simply means it would be an OPTION for every citizen in every state, with or without needing to list a reason. Trump would still need to differentiate if that is EXPLICITLY what he‚Äôs talking about.
I‚Äôm not comparing them in how they got into power. I‚Äôm comparing them by the way they present themselves. They both have authoritarian thoughts and motives. Hence, Trump‚Äôs tweet today:
Go Trump... üá∫üá∏
No mask!  Blame Trump
#Civilization5 : I just had what I call a "Trump Moment"... I pressed the "launch" button while looking at a specific place in the map, not realizing the nuke was pointed somewhere else nearby... now I'm in an unintended war with an opponent much better prepared to kick my ass.
I will always hate him for his ‚Äúit‚Äôs time to come together‚Äù post Trump win victory speech.   Like, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre pay attention. Are you?‚Äù
Kids don‚Äôt have serious cases look it up, what trump doesn‚Äôt want is mail in voting because it‚Äôs so easy to cheat that way, someone‚Äôs dead cat got a voter registration card in the mail, I dont click on your videos anymore because of how soyboy you‚Äôve become Hila is cool tho
One of these weeks we'll wake up to a Black Mirror reality of Trump fucking a pig on television. Then he'll do something worse by Tuesday.
When you're a Republican and have lost the Federalist Society....
Trump can't get it through his thick skull that mail in voting benefits both parties equally. On top of that, don't he realize people in the military also vote by mail.
Trump Meets with Family of Slain Soldier, Offers To Pay for Funeral
3rd party is a win for trump though
Tweet is pointing out his death was needless. Not disrespectful at all.
Trump knew about this for years, he even joked about Epstein's pedophilia. He didn't distance himself from Epstein until the property dispute.
Then, all states should have early voting &amp; there shouldn't be voting suppression. In the mist of a global pandemic people shouldn't stand in line hours on end to vote. There's no arguing that President Trump is the President of the USA.
We are ok with that. Even better he was not a narcissist rapist white supremacy idiot like Trump. #RepublicansForBiden #RepublicansAgainstTrump
Please tell me you have a plan ready, for when you win the election, and Trump refuses to abide by the decision.  Please.  I‚Äôm worried for me and, most importantly, my family.  #Biden2020

FYI- Trump does not remain as POTUS if there isn‚Äôt an election in November.
Nah, You‚Äôre obviously right about their hatred for Trump, but that has nothing to do with that, at least not the main reason, it‚Äôs part of a long process to a New World order, this, per George Soros own words.
President Trump asks recovered COVID-19 patients to donate plasma -
It‚Äôs inherently racist because we live in a system that guarantees that IF a memeber of the minority group DOES accend to heights, it‚Äôs predicated on that individual demonstratively NOT being an Ally to his/her minority group.
So now we're back for circle and you understand my first take. He doesn't have to do anything at all to appeal to any of us and he can just hide. Like I said he's literally failing upwards just because Trump is so awful not because he's offering us anything to vote *for.*
Now you can't even trust the post office To deliver your mail in vote damn Republicans you are really on a roll. Remember to put your names in the history book all you scumbags who  keep supporting trump agenda. Republicans who has broken the laws of the land and covering up for
Trump‚Äôs pronouncements today about delaying elections and beehives of terrorists are only trying to grab headlines away from 150k dead from Covid, GDP contracting in Q2 at highest rate ever, and 17 million Americans out of work.
I believe it's too replace funding that went to his wall. And he wants the FBI building to stay where it is so no one builds a hotel there (across from Trump Plaza).
Trying to defend the inept DemocRATS who would not allow  the AG to answer the question?  They were there to grandstand and carry the Anti-Trump banner.
Have you tried the Demon Sperm?
Sounds like a bit ch ass KAREN to me. trump is a bit ch ass KAREN.
Trump thought he'd leave the blue states to screw themselves, as if he weren't the entire country's President!! He's violated his oath to this country. #resigninshame
Thank u 4 doing the rounds on Spanish press, I'm seeing and hearing nicaraguens and venezuelans falling 4 the same BS a lot of the older cuban generation fell for with Trump and you being a reputable republican calling it as it is really is necessary. 2 much  stake!
Oh, so you‚Äôre the Trump whisperer?  ok lol
That not new! But today his true colors came out 4all to see. His presidency was d groundwork for much of what‚Äôs happening today. He thought it would continue when HRC became President never expected Trump to win but certainly took measures just in case. Disgrace is too nice
Donald is never realizing how desperate and weak his tweets are making him look. üëÄ

As Trump floats delaying election, DeSantis and Florida voting officials say there‚Äôs no need
And yet....Trump raw dogs porn stars and WW Evangelicals love him and wax poetic about his mIl order bride Melanie. Even Newt G.'s Calista did not face this level of vitriol.  It's something about HRC.  Oh yeah, she's actually intelligent and can form a coherent sentence.
I said on policy. Remember he's a status quo, corporatist, neoliberal, right-of-center politician that refuses to offer even one major concession on policy for the left who is offering old Obama era policies. You know, the neolib trash that got us a Trump in the 1st place.

What about this tho?
I‚Äôm a hate group because I hate you and trump so much
It‚Äôs literally our only hope, because unless high ranking generals come out and stand next to biden with a contingent of armed troops at his back, trump ain‚Äôt stepping down and he doesn‚Äôt care about laws or the constitution or anything else
Gilliam a pop. African American progressive entering his gubernatorial race with DeSantis and the incumbent Nelson couldn‚Äôt win in a wave midterm.  Idc what the polls say, Biden has a very steep climb for Florida. I‚Äôm a resident here and outside of South FL. It‚Äôs Trump country
I was saying this the other day... As soon as I see an American flag I automatically think they‚Äôre either racist or Trump supporters.
I love this ... trump hates this
He's wrong. How long have we been having vote by mail...not issues with widespread fraud. Now in 2020 we suddenly found out about election fraud by mail, and Trump discovered it?!! We going with that? Reach much?
You made it sound like my mention of the co-morbidity factor was off-base when it was not.  So i mentioned that. Of course not one factor. I also begged NPR to have a psychiatrist explain Trump's particular sociopathy was more like a 5 yr old's &amp; to respond to the R re hands-up.
This is being the complete lie. ü§´
Love this President Trump! Always working for the American people!
DemoKKKrats are delusional.    NONE has said: ‚ÄúMr. President this is what we recommend, it will help‚Äù   When Trump banned flights from China they called him ‚Äúxenophobic‚Äù.  That in fact saved thousands of not millions.
If you want youth and Black voters to turn out, they have to LOVE the candidate.  No one loves Biden.  Hillary lost in 2016 in part because the Obama coalition on Black voters didn't show up.  Black voters don't hate Trump.  He is more popular now than he was in 2016.
Trump is talking about Americans here. Referring to protesters as a beehive of terrorists to be ‚Äúcleaned out.‚Äù Horrifying fascist language here.
Trump murdered... are u parrot of CNN? Projection was 3.3 mil dead By banning China at 2 deaths, closing USA at 54 deaths, Trillion $economy, he SAVED 3.15 Million ppl Would‚Äôve been more if DEM Governors didn‚Äôt obstruct #Hydroxycloroquine &amp;didn‚Äôt seed infected into nursing homes
Trump: ‚ÄúAbsentee ballots are good, but mail ballots are a huge fraud.‚Äù
They pontificate in these what if‚Äôs as if any of these reporters have the slightest inkling of what motivates Trump voters.
Tell that imbecile  who said Trump was ‚Äòjoking‚Äô about delaying the election, to turn on the #TrumpPressConference.
All I can say is, #BigTech, have your fun now, because after Trump wins re-election and takes back the House with a #MAGA Speaker, he is gonna kick your ass sideways.
Just found out Donald trump is the hero ...MIND BLOWN
That's a lie.
The Federalist Society, the people who gave Trump a list of the most radical right-wing judges on the planet. Yeah, you guys have a lot of credibility, doing harm to the country, that is.
He's literally failing upwards just bc Trump is so awful. Most people voting Joe are doing so *against* Trump, not *for* Joe or any policy. He's flavorless tofu. This is peak hostage situation. He's literally our only option and only marginally less damaging than Trump on policy.
Donald Trump messed things up so bad that people with U.S. passports literally can‚Äôt travel almost anywhere in the world.
The Federalist Society just pulled a Hamilton on Trump
Lol ! It'll be useful if working in close contact with people who can suddenly cough or project body fluids or to avoid touching the eyes . The shield protects the nose as a port of entry also.  But if social distance is ok more than 6ft none of those are necessary
So this cracker Trump got the nerve to say November election should be postponed cause of COVID-19 concerns but this the same man calling it a hoax?
Who cares about the Flynn case? Nobody cause Trump will pardon him anyway. Who cares about the Steele Dossier? Nobody except #DevinNunes. Who cares about the Portland protests, except #SeanHannity? and who cares about #BilldeBlasio - nobody. Sums up most of politics I follow.
Donald is trying to be distracting everyone from this:

How were these reporters told they were only at the press conference to fluff Trump?
Screw Pollo Tropical!! they donated their money to the Trump campaign!! That‚Äôs why I only buy their yuca bites now
I think Bernie voters hate the DNC more than they hate Trump. They may look at letting Trump win as a way of breaking the DNCs back so they can take over in 2022.

18-30 voters and black voters will NOT turn out to vote for a candidate they aren't excited about. Also former Bernie Campaign staff are saying no way Bernie voters vote for Biden.  We are headed for an epic Trump rout and take back of the House. This will be huge.
I find it so ridiculous how republicans talk about voting fraud like they‚Äôre the most perfect little angels. I‚Äôm sure y‚Äôall would be committing voting fraud too just to save your lord and savior Trump

Folks, Trump is gonna win.
You brought up trump didn‚Äôt you
Panic? Did  not take Covid-19 seriously? Did  attend Trump‚Äôs rally in Tulsa WITHOUT a mask? How did that work out?Same could be said for your comments, sir. Please tell us you're not like trump who always thinks he's the smartest person in the room. Do you think you're the smartest person in the room. Sure sounds like it.
Did you know Trump voted illegally? It was in the papers here, but nothing was done of course. See, in FL, you have to list a residential address. M-A-L is not on the books as residential, so Trump actually committed VOTER FRAUD!
Oh. My. God. Can it be? I feel the rapture going through me and not lifting me up because hell no. All because Trump told a truth for once!!
Obama did 2 things that I'd take him 2 task 4, the TPA he wanted, but finally got shamed out of at the last min, n not telling #MoscowMitch 2 piss off 2 even up the playing field after Comey's fucking brain aneurism ouying the HRC emails by throwing the üá∑üá∫ help 4 Trump into play.
Yes at the hands of Donald J Trump
So can we now say that Donald J. Trump KlLLED Cain? AFAF
Not a socialist but I don‚Äôt like Trump. This is still America right?
Not a chance. Biden will win in a landslide and after that, the only unresolved issue will be where to send trump's last presidential check. By the way, these conspiracy theory, worst case scenario stories, serve no real purpose. Report real news and lay off the what if stories.
King Trump?
King Trump??
The crazy thing about this is that nobody utilized all those empty seats.   At the very least, you could have spaced yourselves out a bit.   Herman Cain beat stage 4 cancer, but decided to risk it all for a Trump rally. Sad way to go.   Cover your face. Quit crying about it.

And  said it is up to the DOJ. It's not. Don't let that little nugget get lost in the truckload of *trump bullshit we have to wade through day in and day out.
Res ipsa loquitur and what a deadly message indeed. trump should be court ordered to visit every grave beyond the 15 or so he predicted back in January when he called Covid a hoax.
*trump and class are two words that should never ever ever be used in the same sentence.
#HermanCain- Don't know much abt him, but condolences to his family. All those who appease Donald Trump's ego abt #mask and #Hydroxychloroquine, pay attention to scientific facts if you want to live.  &amp; others crowding around your 'TrumpGod' Put your family first.
Looks like we are not going to become a lawless nation after all. I think at this point, just about everyone has had enough of trump's and barr's attempts at circumventing the law. I have always believed that there are still good, decent people, who aren't part of trump nation.
Trump is such a baby.
Right but my point being if it eliminates Trump for now we can work on the rest later. Choices are so limited
Translation, we are just as ready to be rid of trump as the rest of the world.
Thare is just one case per state every six or seven years, on average of Mail-In voter fraud. We are talking about an occurrence that translates to about 0.00006 percent of total votes cast. Trump's just terrified because you can't cheat if there's a #PaperTrail
*trump doesn't joke. He has no sense of humor whatsoever.
The morning after the #Tulsarally Trump said he never jokes.
Trump wanting to postpone the election is an ACTUAL threat to democracy but people are too busy pretending that politics are about their team winning to rationalize that.
‚ÄòOn the golf course ‚Äî I gotta go‚Äô: Republicans wimp out after being confronted with Trump‚Äôs call to delay elections
Right . Trump can actually think for himself and not a puppet like Biden would be
Yes yes yes ... Trump is going to take over the country, just like you thought.
Trump is terrified . You are so right. He‚Äôs terrified of a rigged election!!! That‚Äôs what he‚Äôs terrified about!!!
Chuck your not telling the whole story again.. king trump just sent in his royal guard to kidnap people. #Cult45 #DementiaDon #ChuckLikesToKissTrumpsAss
Yeah Trump has the right ideas, but often doesn‚Äôt execute them properly. Again if Germany cares about NATO so much, why aren‚Äôt they meeting their contractual obligation? America pointing that out isn‚Äôt the US not being a good partner.

Pres Trump might not be correct. However the Bush team was a complete disaster, and we‚Äôre still paying for their errors. So I don‚Äôt listen any of their criticism.  The Obama team didn‚Äôt have any answers either. I think we need a rethink in the USA, not a return to Bush years

Delay the election but send children back to school now. Got it. trump's statement is purely self-serving, ridiculous, and narcissistic. He wants more time to make his case to America. The 150,000 people that died because he denied Covid and failed to act would like more time.
Trump's DELAY - He will be dragged out of the WH 1/2021 His suggestion of delay Election 2020 tweet is for him to try and get the economy afoot &amp; a speedy vaccine. That Won't Work
Trump can take his #Fracking to Ma-A-Lago to dig for oil! People have died. Stop killing our #Environment US Geo Survey acknowledges drilling for oil&amp; fracking have caused earthquakes! (so why did SJU &amp; Haiti have earthquakes) Stay away fr poor people of color with your poison!
Would Mr. Trump want to delay the election if a democrat were in office?   I know he just loves to throw hand grenades in the room...so let‚Äôs use this as a rallying cry to make sure we have a well run and closely monitored voting process.
Trump tweeted about delay the election shortly after new data showed the economy shrank by a record one-third in the last quarter.   Pathetic and coward..!
July 30th, 2020, the day *trump went full dictator.
What are your thoughts on *trump going full 3rd world dictator this morning, preemptively talking about canceling November? Since you're my Senator, I'd really like a response. ü§î
President Trump has no say on when to hold the General Elections. For the preservation of our democracy, all members of Congress Republican or Democrat, Supreme Court Justices must make it clear the elections will occur in November.
They cannot help themselves.  It makes Trump look bad so it will be blasted across the headlines.  Had we let this virus run its course this would be done already.  But that would not fit the narrative that joe will save the day.
But Trump has voted by mail. Why is it good enough for him but not for everyone else?

I‚Äôm not a leftist.  More a recovering right winger, but you cannot tell me that old chestnut holds water.  Trump has had over 3 years to fix stockpiles.  He was left with a comprehensive Pandemic Prep plan that he just ignored.  This is Trumps Mess. Let‚Äôs not wipe his ass. Again.
Terrible to have to blame the guys that have been gone over 3 years for all the wrong that Trump creates
This is what real leadership looks like. Real leaders make decisions not based on what's politically expedient but what's best for the populace as a whole. If we had this kind of leadership in Washington fewer families in this country would be in mourning. Trump failed the U.S.
Doctor admits the obvious. The U.S. was slow in recognizing the Covid threat from Europe. No kidding, sherlock. We had a president playing politics with one of the deadliest diseases to hit the world in 100 years. He said the dems made up Covid to hurt him. Trump failed the U.S.
Nothing to worry about here, consider the source. Barr is not credible. The trump administration is in the throw it against the wall and see what sticks phase. Clear sign of desperation. Don't give life to their desperation. Rise above the pettiness and speak to the issues.

Do some research, HCQ is the preferred treatment for COVID world wide.  The US is only country where this drug has been politicized and attacked.  Why?  Because Trump liked it.  How many have the media killed through their jihad against this effective. TDS kills
I always used to begrudgingly say Trump is going to win big in November. Then COVID came and now this. I think we‚Äôre gonna see him lose by somewhere in the range of 15-20 million votes and the house and senate are going to have near super majorities.

It‚Äôs astounding that Trump is JUST NOW realizing that no one likes him.   Like watching all of GOT and during the finale saying, ‚Äúthey are dragons in this show?‚Äù
Truth? It's OK Trump snubbed Lewis. It's one of his only honest acts in office. Racism &amp; cowardice make Trump totally unfit to honor Lewis in any way. His forced, emotionless Teleprompter speech would've soiled the occasion. A giant needs no fake tributes from small, petty men.

If President Trump and his administration are fascist, then she would have been silenced year ago.  Every time she speaks she proves Republicans are not fascist.
Voting for Trump, then glued to the MSM tears. Just like 4 years ago, only BIGGER!
Lol youre a ü§°. Have you seen your buddies on the left....check the burnt cities and liars in congress promoting the portests for political gain. Its ok though. Trump will be back for 4 more years in November. You liberals can get pissed all over again. Keep Twitter
This guy loves to criticize others while taking no responsibility for his own failures. Mccarthy was silent  back when trump called Covid a hoax, and has maintained that silence to present day. Mccarthy is a hypocrite. Get your own house in order before you start in on others.
Clueless!!  Trump asks why he doesn't have high approval on coronavirus efforts like Fauci
Can we for the moment not focus on what trump wants or what he likes. Let us with a laser like focus put the needs of the American worker first, period. Enough of this nonsense.   Trump does not support parts of Senate Republican coronavirus relief bill
Like Barr saying it depends on what kind of foreign help for *trump. Like that? Depends? That's a crime. You know. I know it, and I bet damn well Barr knows it too. But anything to cling to power. Right Linds?

Ok. I believe Trump mishandled it early on just like most of the world but when he did ban flights from China and later Europe he was called a xenophobe by Biden.... calling him a racist for trying to shut down incoming flights. A lot more should have been done... no doubt...
What a surprise, trump has told yet another lie. THE GREAT DECEIVER is deceived by his own deception. At this point, trump probably can no longer distinguish between light and darkness, nor good and evil.  He is reprobate.

Were you surprised by any of his responses? Me either.  That's the point. I shouldn't know what he's going to say before he says it. Ask me how I knew trump was going to drag out the (boogie man) now that he's down in the polls. They always do. Same stuff, different year.
... I‚Äôve been supporting Biden since bernie endorsed him, glad you eventually came around, but it‚Äôs a little ridiculous that it took trump going full gestapo for KYLE to even consider voting for him...
Watched the whole hearing...no questions asked, no information gathered, Democrats wanted thei 5 minutes of fame....next time just send a cut out of the Trump official...
Explain! oops! You meant to say Donald Trump is straight up lying ALL HIS LIFE &amp; worst since he became POTUS
Bravo to these great gentlemen. If only we had a president who wasn't dillusional enough to believe that he is always the smartest person in the room. trump denied the existence of Covid-19 from day one. Next, he attacked science in an attempt to cover up his stupidity.
People do this because they know that we have a president, and republican senate that are simple-minded enough to believe what they see without a full investigation. trump is easily manipulated and with zero fact checking, will start spreading rumors about anything.
ANYONE but tRump 2020! This Republican will not be voting for Trump!
What is the Democrats plan by insinuating Trump will not leave office ifdefeated?  Multiple lawsuits when Biden loses?  They will be still contesting 2016 and the 2020 elections forever?

No thanks.  America doesn't need anything from a trump.

You should be ashamed of cheering trump's inept handling of the Covid crisis. If we had a conscientious leader, thousands of Americans would still be alive. Your failure to speak up while the Denier in Chief was mismanaging this crisis is the greater shame. You failed America.

You literally could not be any more detached from reality. Trump is by far the greatest president of my lifetime. He has accomplished more than most presidents before him. Trump will win again by an even larger margin because people are waking up and fleeing the Democrat party..
It probably would go away if the media stfu about it. Just like the rioting went away when Trump released all them solders and the blamestream media is trying to twist it around like they're kidnapping people lmao. Every 4 years something happens.
It wasn't Trump it was faucci but you won't blame him because he's your go to guy obviously.

Instead of trolling me do your research and read the shit. I bet you were the first to believe Trump said inject yourself with Lysol too lmao.
Retweet reminder..  Trump&amp;Administration, have worked against our Nation getting a hold on this virus, since the very beginning, and they still are. Trump doesn't care‚Ü©  Putin paying to kill our Soldiers. Does he know if Russia is responsible for Covid19?

Joe, keep hiding from the public eye. We‚Äôre watching. You will lose to Donald Trump by a large margin in November!
There could have been many places that he contracted COVID-19 from. Plus they handed out mask at the rally and he chose not to wear one. Who‚Äôs to say he got it there? Apparently he had also been traveling to Arizona prior to diagnosis. Left just want to blame Trump for everything
No, it should go on as scheduled.  Trump needs to just shut up about it. He‚Äôs practically won already. The Democrats whole platform since his inauguration was get him out, and they haven‚Äôt even been able to do that. There‚Äôs no need to delay it.
Those that voted for Trump see the light and see the darkness of the loser left agenda. Once he started showing us your true colors that's when y'all started going nuts and psychotic. Who's actions should we trust. Obviously not y'all confused liberals.
He contacted it from a Trump Rally.
Trump does not have the power himself to move the date of the election, which was set by an 1845 federal law placing it the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Only the joint House and Senate can change the date. Carry on.
If the left continues to say its not safe and if no voter ID is required a delay would be the only option. I personally would stand in line in a storm to vote for Trump.
I believe that the vote will be fair no matter what!! Yes I‚Äôm voting for you mr trump. You need to try to win not think about losing!! If you lose you lose. Please stop. This makes you look weak
Actually my God is a big G not a little g. Maybe you should get to know Him. All through the Bible He works through people others discount. Trump is not perfect. He doesnt have to be because my God is. Trumps policies line up more than the left and protect my freedom to Worship.

Yup, that‚Äôs tRUMP to a tee. I might add narcissistic moron though
who tf are you???  literally uses facts to make his points yet you have the nerve to call him disingenuous???? Seriously where do you get off?? For the record Trump will win again easily so get your knee pads ready.üòÇüòÇ
Sir you are a partisan hack. You lie as much as Trump.
I remember actually celebrating in 2016 in front of my TV when #Trump won the election. It was one of the best celebrations of my life. A climatic win over the doubting #MSM  I expect a repeat! We must be heard again! LOUDER than before. It's our duty! #MAGA2020 #SilentMajority
I voted for  in #Florida. Even though she'd dropped out before our primary (which is a ludicrous part of our current system btw). I think Biden is one of the worst candidates out of the final 8-10 in the race. But I'll still vote for him over a blatantly despicable Trump!
I have no idea how he or Trump do it.  I'd be calling in drone strikes on most of those idiots.

Take Trump out of the equation. What about all the Drs that are actually treating patients?  What about the countries that are using it? Dont let hatred of Trump blind you. Fauci has  investment he wants to be profitable!

1 - 100. Because Trump recommended it and it could have probably saved over 100,000 lives, and they would rather have dead Americans than Trump be reelected and him finally drain the swamp and expose their crimes.

Trump can do a rally without the rally by doing it on youtube.
I call BS on this article!! Trump could careless about Fauci who is killing Americans by politicizing Hydroxychloroquine. He he would admit it works instead of protecting his investments we could stomp covid out.
Good read from The Atlantic on trump
He's right.  It's also the only places all the riots were happening. It's also the same democratic ran cities that the mayor's and governor's held the police back so their sheep could attack it's own citizens. Also they make terrorist threats like this while blaming Trump.
Yes, he did get rid of NAFTA.  You have to stop reading the slanted press.  Your facts are all over the place.  Believe me, if I stopped at the first article that was critical of Trump and believed it, I would probably feel the same way you do.

Your hatred for Donald trump will kill you before the coronavirus.
Live Trump States:
It should go viral and if these celebrities talk trash too you see their intentions too. Trump is putting out the military to take down these maniacs and fox just showed who they really support by their actions. Trump is protecting citizens and they still want to bitch and whine!
If you don‚Äôt want to be reminded of our terrible president- then perhaps you should take a little Twitter break until November 4th.  Until this election is put to bed I‚Äôll bet you won‚Äôt find anything ‚ÄúTrump free‚Äù on any news media or social media. Take care!
Know this; if and when the ANTIFA and BLM anarchists bring their violence and chaos out to the backwoods, Trump win or not, a bunch of them are just going to go missing. And it won‚Äôt be because of unidentifiable special police in unmarked vans.   It‚Äôs lonely &amp; dark in the woods.
My face when a member of the media says patently stupid things and people actually listen and nod as though the media member has any clue what they‚Äôre talking about.   In this case; don‚Äôt vote for Trump or there may be more violence...from the violent anarchists already rioting.
I mean do you feel like Trump is in such control that he will win no matter what, because he has to because that‚Äôs just part of the operation, or...  Is there a chance it could go the other way by people people voting, or even it being rigged?  Does he know he will win?

Trump is not a president he is a bully &amp; his extreme dictatorial behavior has given license to all these rougue cops &amp; others who feel that can commit unspeakable crimes &amp; get away with it.
Trump will stop at nothing.  This is starting to be widely reported.
I just had a total epiphany.   Last year president Donald Trump signed the right to try act which gives patients with a potentially life threatening disease the right to take any medication they choose. Now we have covidd patients being denied hydroxychloroquine.  Hmmmmü§îü§îü§îü§î
Trump puts Trump first.  He could care less about the American people.  He is devoid of feelings

This is the inane doctor a total idiot who Trump was touting today. Why? One reason among many is due to the fact that he is trying to give credibility to Hydroxychloroquine so he can unload his stash.
Kudos to Kaitlin.  Trump just couldn‚Äôt answer.  #Unhingedtrump
Barr says, ‚ÄúHistory is written by the winners.‚Äù  All I can say is if you &amp; Trump consider yourselves winners, we are in deep trouble.
Trump on a rampage pushing hydroxychloroquine again.  Could it be that he has so much $ invested in it that he‚Äôs trying to unload it?  Sounds logical.
Despite Trump's goading, Biden steers clear of 'law and order' debate: THATS BS--HE SPOKE FOR DEFUNDING THE POLICE. BIDEN IS A COMPLETE JERK THAT SHOULD NOT BE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. HE WILL NOT SPEAK OUT AGAINST THE VIOLENCE GOING ON. HE IS A RACIST-HE SPOKE OUT AGAINST BUSING
It is just ridiculous! They didn‚Äôt want him there to ask questions. The Dems just want him there so they could badger him. Forget getting getting to any truth! It is all about their hatred for President Trump.
Who do you work for!?  YOU?  You have no real answers or suggestions, you answer your own questions just to rip Barr and Trump and get your BS point across.  Supposed to be an opportunity for witness to answer questions.
I have one thing to say to Trump..if you don't want all neg trends about you, stop being such a hateful, racist, narcissist and show some compassion for human beings for a change

So if you don't like Trump and you weren't there for an interview, asking for a job on the campaign then why were you there?  It doesn't pass the smell test.
It was reported that trump was asked not to tweet, speak or mention  the name "John Lewis".
Because the deep state would rather let thousands of Americans die than admit President Trump was right. They hate America
This is what scares me about Trump possibly being reelected there‚Äôs way too many of these kind of people out there.
Pence has been a loyal lapdog to the point of sycophancy. Replacing him sounds exactly like something Trump would do - on Twitter.
I will never understand the mindset of people who associate with Trump. Yeah, I get the "proximity to power" theory. But Trump's history is littered with people who left their relationship with less than what they started with. And that's the best case scenario.
Trump I believe will be on trial at the Hague. Evil person.
The Whitehouse belongs to the people of the United States not trump and his goons. Take down that wall.
The Virus that Trump ignored for months is now a serious problem in our country.   Let the professionals speak the truth.
THIS GUY IS AN IDIOT. I SUPPOSE TRUMP SHOULD LET THEM DESTROY FEDERAL BUILDINGS -HARM AND KILL PEOPLE-TAXPAYERS WILL BE THE ONES THAT END UP PAYING FOR THE DAMAGE. WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH THIS GUY. DEFUND DEMOCRATS NOT THE POLICE.
THAT IS BS. DEMOCRATS ARE DOING NOTHING TO STOP THE VIOLENCE. THEY WANT TO KEEP IT UP TO MAKE TRUMP LOOK BAD. IF TO WANT TO SEE DICTATORSHIP LOOK AT DEMOCRATS IF THEY WIN. THEY WILL CONTROL EVERY ASPECT OF YOUR LIFE !!!
Fake news. But if the report happens to be true, it won't last through Trump's next mood swing/tantrum (take your pick). This is not the first time we've heard he's going to be more "presidential". 140,000 people could tell you how that turned out if they were alive to do so.

None of that is Trump‚Äôs fault.

Romney was so certain he was going to win in 2012 that he didn't bother to write a concession speech, proving two things: he didn't know the electorate in 2012 (and hasn't learned anything since), and he's a pretty decent writer on the fly.
And so it begins.  Trump cancelled the RNC here in Florida TODAY. All of a sudden MSM is reporting inflted numbers?!? HOW STUPID DO YOU THINK WE ARE???

And vice versa. But, either way, the lack of jobs aren't on Trump. Plus, what you just said, is not the excuse the left has been using.
Pres. Trump urges plasma donations.
That's called COVID-19, idiot. That's not on Trump. If anyone, it's on the liberals because republicans want to stop the benefits while liberals want to continue it. As long as these benefits are going, people with minimum wage aren't going to want to go back to work.
He attended trump‚Äôs Tulsa event where it was taboo to wear a mask and be socially distant
When is the last time Trump went to a funeral?  Maybe Herman Cains?  Probably not, might interrupt his golf game.
His blood is all over Trump's hands.  Where was the hydroxychloroquine miracle drug?
First, Hermain Cain...now Bill Montgomery, founder of  . Both dead of the plague they helped to create. Dying desperate, alone and suffering. Let us take this moment of solemn reflection, on the nature of cosmic justice.
Is there any other Republican looking to stand with  call for Trump authoritarianism other than  and #BillBarr? Time to stand up GOP! Honor above party.
Not one bit. All 3 are part of the corrupt deep state that has robbed the American people of their freedom and dignity for years. They are the epitome of the swamp that Trump is draining.
That moment Donald Trump says he wants to suspend the election, and you realize we're all Gary K. Longstreet now.   Irony.   Time to end this #AmericanHorrorStory .     HELL NO
Cuomo is not the president. Trump should have lead the nation. He‚Äôs an ass.
Trump floats unprecedented idea of delaying election, which he cannot do
When Jesus meets the religious people of his day - a group called the Pharisees - he straight up calls them exactly what they are: hypocrites. He says they make themselves look good on the outside, but on the inside they are really ugly. Trump is a ugly liar.
Trump is a racist for lying about banning travel, tho ...
1. Trump and his minions accused Hillary of running a pedophile ring out of a pizza place in NY. 2. Trump always projects 3. Anonymous releases court docs stating Trump is pedophile 4. Maxwell in custody, and Trump wishes her well 5. Trump hawks pizza place in NY on twitter Hmmmm
Trump's election tweet draws fire from Dems and acknowledgement from GOP that MAIL-IN voting is a major concern.
Because in April he attacked Biden for suggesting Trump would try to delay the election and well, Trump just suggested to delay the election. Haha
Not true.  Many of us are voting Trump so we can keep what we work for.  Some of us suburban women have to work and don't sit on the couch in yoga pants watching talk shows and daydrinking while their kids play video games.
I believe Trump had to let this play out.  Fauci destroyed himself.  It needed to be done without interference.  Yes we‚Äôve suffered through the FAKERY but we‚Äôre alive and safe.
Trump floats November election delay - but he can‚Äôt do that  #SmartNews
Because it wasn‚Äôt this broken until Trump started breaking things!
So Trump wants to ‚Äúdelay‚Äù the election, as expected. Just a tad afraid of losing? I believe it would be unconstitutional and the move of a petty dictator. He won‚Äôt go away quietly.   Maybe he will just go away ‚Äúlike a miracle.‚Äù
I appreciate the tax cuts. They really helped my family. Also Seniors on Social Security received their biggest cost of living raises in many years. Thank you President Trump for doing your best to keep campaign promises.
He attended Trump‚Äôs Superspreader event in Tulsa, which is where he contracted COVID. #TrumpIsResponsible
They said Trump took the dementia test and said it was hard
Twitter Reacts to Herman Cain Getting Coronavirus Post Trump Rally
Herman Cain died from attending Trump's Tulsa rally. Good thing not that many people showed up.
Barack was and is the birther. He and Moochel≈Çe wasted more of our money on their little dates to NY and vacations in Europe and Hawaii than the Trumps. I am sure that President Trump uses his own money to pay for his family's excesses. Remember, he does not take a salary.
Trump worships at the altar of Ebenezer Scrooge.
What a bunch of üêÇüí© President Trump has been a great President even though he has had to fight you "Swamp People" all the way. I am not ashamed of voting for him and I will vote for his re-election. GOD BLESS AMERICA AND OUR POTUS. üá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏è

Great idea.  Only helps Trump.  Black and brown suburbanites want to protect their investments just as much as white suburbanites.  Education and home ownership, you are on the wrong side...
Let me postulate for just a moment: Y would they want to make it difficult to run for federal office: because they‚Äôre opening the flood gates, which Trump is trying to close, for people from authoritarian states whom they will need to rule over.
'My blood boils': Trump's admission angers ex-GOP lawmaker  AS MINE DOES ALSO. WE NEED TO REMOVE TOXIC TRUMP FROM OFFICE ASAP. WHY IS  TRUMP STILL IN OFFICE TODAY? AFTER ALL THIS TOXIC PRES. HAS DONE TO SO VERY MANY AMERICANS?? REMOVE TRUMP NOW. KG.
Then Trump will forfeit the election by not taking the field which will award Biden the presidency by default. Trump will have to be removed by force.
Trump actually likes working Americans. It's the Americans not working that he would like to see go back to work.
Imagine being the #Democrats and killing this many people!  just so you can say it‚Äôs  fault! just so you can win an election. so you don‚Äôt go to jail! #Trump has said from day 1 #hydroxycholoroquine is a cure! These assholes tell u it will kill u!
Pretty clear Trump was elected in 2016 against Democrat and Russian tampering in election.  Talk about that sabotage, Chris.

This crap has to stop, how can trump and the resnublicans get away with breaking the law, to what they say is upholding the law, the constitution doesn't mean crap in this country
If Fauci had his skin in the game, he would have filed for bankruptcy by now.  If he would have panicked early, after predicting a pandemic, we wouldn't be dealing with this bullshit.  Trump is not a doctor nor probabilist. Fauci is paid to prevent these events.
The worst part about this election for me isn‚Äôt that Trump might win.  It‚Äôs that losing this election won‚Äôt put back all the revelations of racism, classism, and just destructive ideologies I‚Äôve read &amp; heard from people I trusted and looked up to these last few years.
Hard agree with this take. Let‚Äôs not pretend this is Trump‚Äôs desire and there aren‚Äôt a whole bunch of people who have been pushing for this for a long time and are cheering right now.
His attitude?  So, it's cool for the President to say "all this for a flag" and sell our country out to foreign countries,  but Trump has an attitude towards rioters and looters and this is an issue?  Sorry, you are just NOT thinking clearly and have shown us all.  #Trump2020

Because Trump knows it would be hypocritical to ask after the US paid bounties to Osama bin Laden to kill Soviet troops in Afghanistan in the 1980s.

No one is going to jail. Politicians, celebrities are somehow above the law. Money gets you everywhere. There will just be a lot of posturing. In the end, nothing changes. Been that way for decades. Thought Trump would fix it, but 3 years, years later, nothing.
I feel Susan Rice is the best fit for VP, not that the others aren't up for the job, but with the relationship that's been destroyed by trump, Susan with her experience would be the best choice!

We love you president trump
They are desperate! ...
So instead of entertaining an idea as absurd as Trump unilaterally delaying an election, something which there is no mechanism for him to do, let‚Äôs instead worry about how we‚Äôre going to hold that election in the middle of a pandemic.
The question is not whether we will have an election on November 3rd. It‚Äôs whether or not Trump is able to sow enough chaos to squeak out a win. At best, what he‚Äôs doing now is just him trying to delegitimize Biden‚Äôs victory, not actually delay an election.
I know it can feel like Trump can do anything sometimes, but he can‚Äôt. He is repeatedly stopped in the courts, by congress, and by his own ineptitude. The only stuff he does get away with is stuff that involves Senate Republicans or his own cronies.
Then January 20th arrives. California held its elections so Pelosi is re-elected. Trump is constitutionally forced to leave. The Roberts court will deny any challenges because it‚Äôs CLEARLY SPELLED OUT. Pelosi is sworn in. Trump is kicked out by the secret service.
Most of the illegal shit Trump‚Äôs done has been confined to things the toadies in his own administration are willing to do. In order to delay the election WITHOUT congressional approval, he‚Äôs going to need to be able to simply declare ‚Äúelection‚Äôs off,‚Äù and...
Alright, genuine question: what mechanism is Trump going to use to delay the 2020 election?
This is exactly how Trump wanted y‚Äôall to spend your day. Exactly what he wanted asked in his stupid presser. Instead of the GDP news. Instead of why he has not paid tribute to John Lewis. Instead of why he‚Äôs protecting the White House with a bunker.
Just a thought. If Trump got his way and ‚Äòdelayed‚Äô the election, both Trump and Pence would constitutionally be out of office on Jan 20. The Speaker, 3rd in line, would become Acting Madam President Pelosi. Pass it on.
If Trump had mandated masks at his Tulsa rally, Herman Cain would still be alive.
Forgiving George Wallace. He apologized to John Lewis, while Trump will never apologize for his racism and bigotry!
If you‚Äôve had enough of Donald Trump‚Äôs chaos and corruption, here‚Äôs one way you can help end it.  Chip in ANY AMOUNT to attend the virtual grassroots fundraiser with  and  tomorrow and let‚Äôs sweep Donald Trump into the dustbin of history.
So self respecting woman votes for Trump.  Every mom I know is sick and tired of the dangerous and divisive DJT bullshit train and will be voting straight blue this year.    ...and I'll be looking forward to seeing #denialdonald removed forcefully on  inauguration day.
A Half-Century After Wallace, Trump Echoes the Politics of Division
What happened to Herman Cain was predicted.  Trump knew it would happen to a percentage of attendees.  That‚Äôs why he made them sign a liability waiver.  He was ok with it as long as he got to have his rally.  I can‚Äôt understand why both sides aren‚Äôt outraged.
Imbecil, that's why Trump did prison reform, because police, including elite FBI, bully people into taking a plea. They do it to minorities too often or any one who is their enemy. These agencies have too much power.
Sounds like Trump is trying to cheat by electronic voting and vote by mail blocks that.
Please stay on this Stephanie. This may be one of the worst flagrant abuses since Trump has been in office. And why? it makes NO sense shy of profiteering...the question that is everything is who knew on Monday? Who acted? This is not something even Barr can simply brush away.
But not in a racist way.  Someone is going to show me how the lives of Trump voters who wait all day to see him freestyle on the mic....have inproved since 2016.  They look like the same dirt poor inbred Whites I would see when we drove by the trailer park.
This is called voter suppression folks. Trump is going to lose and he knows it.

Your kidding. Trump has never felt responsible for anything in his life. He is a psychopath.
It‚Äôs fairly clear that he chose to vilify the science behind mask use to please Trump. He put his faith in a charlatan rather than the true experts. That loyalty ultimately cost him his life.

in your interview, didn‚Äôt Trump say he‚Äôd have a new health care plan to reveal in two weeks? Two weeks is coming up on Sunday. Will you follow up with him? Millions of Americans want to know.
Yes! Florida schools open early and everyone I know with school age kids are not sending them. My sister has opted to officially Home School both hers as it was required to decide in early July and DeSantis has been pushing for in school. Hate that guy almost as much as Trump!
Remarkable on the same day of an exquisite  memorial service for a remarkable man John Lewis , we hear Trump talking about postponing an election. Don‚Äôt let this happen Don‚Äôt let John Lewis down
I'm voting Trump unless I'm dead, God willing.
You media people couldnt stop talking about Steele dossier when you thought it would help you get Trump. Now that Steele might hurt you and help Trump.........crickets
Calls for immediate impeachment!  Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That‚Äôs Unconstitutional.
Imagine telling someone to stfu because they don‚Äôt share their viewpoints. People like you create Trump voters because the left is doing their best to not have conversations and jump to calling everyone villains and racists. This isn‚Äôt how you win people over. Be better.
Trump can say the same thing about Putin!
Anything but anything to tie Trump to this. Anything.
Trump is so out there, I swear he has lost his mind.
idea of a solution. I don't need to trash Trump to make my point. But whatever Trump sees when he looks in the mirror, and what Trump claims to see when he looks at Joe Biden are so far away from the reality.
It is amazing how little self-awareness Trump has that he would call Biden a "buffoon". Biden is self-effacing, humble, humorous, riant, generous, spirited, fit, loving, a goofy grandpop, a kind (if not overly permissive) father, a supportive &amp; proud husband. His friendships are
Trump has a schedule?
This is the most heinous act of his entire presidency. He is our Commander in Chief. His allegiances to Putin R scary and dangerous and Vlad is a professional ex KBGer he knows Trump is in over his head and stupid. Really stupid. He‚Äôs a traitor and shld be tried as one.
There was a time when I thought it couldn't get worse than Dubya, but in the face of what we're going through he's looking mighty fine these days.    This is what real leadership looks like, and Trump having no presidential qualities is another reason #WhyIDontLikeTrump
Barr did not know that legally Trump cannot change the election date. Why didn't he know something so basic? Isn't he the AG?
Watching from the USA. It‚Äôs a much fan as it is to watch trump and his 5 nouns, 3 adjectives and 3 verbs.
Trump, you are the biggest asshole to ever run this country.  Bitch be be gone.  You are the virus that effects us.
A virus he caught at a rally in Tulsa that Trump insisted on having despite the recommendations of experts.  Clearly, #TrumpVirus and #TulsaRallyVirus are both more appropriate.
He might just quit.

Trump Says-  I Think He's A Little OFF when he says "The Younger" are Immune or LESS at Risk to Contract the Corona Virus"  I Think Anyone Born Between 1960/65 to 1990/95 Developed A Tough Immune System based on Those Times they Lived In &amp; Things that They had to deal with!   ???
I could only listen to #Trump for a few minutes.  He is playing the victim role right now. He is experiencing severe #NarcissisticInjury.  He is depressed, paranoid and delusional.  In my opionion, this is dangerous. I am concerned about his state of mind and what he may do.
Completely unbelievable. A desperate Trump is a dangerous Trump and we're getting nowhere with this guy.
Time to watch Hulu instead of listening to trump who is a lying POS about Portland.

The utter nonsense coming out of Trump's mouth right now
The babbling idiot Cowardly Liar Dotard  Trump blames Democrats for Republicans wanting to screw everyone except big corporations. Trump wants to funnel all the relief money to corporations who they hope will trickle it down to citizens.  Years?
trump is so stupid that he thinks ballots are generic. Each ballot is bar-coded with a person's name &amp; address and can be tracked through the system.

trump said Florida cases were coming down, they are NOT! Cases increased over 71k in 7 DAYS!
It is my observation that Biden supports China fully, Why? They do not Want a strong President like Trump, so they are Financing Sleepy Joe &amp; the Dems fully against Trump, so they can continue to abuse our USA and the world. #MAGA2020! They are in for a big surprise!
What Trump doesn‚Äôt understand -oh never mind, everything
Trump is in office thru at least 1/21/21.. no? And the Senate can still confirm a new appointment to SCOTUS by new years eve.

Herman Cain died from the Trump Virus that he caught at the Trump Rally. How many more will you kill?
Opinion | Trump‚Äôs suggestion to delay the election is the most anti-democratic thing any president ever said

As much as the GOP pretending there‚Äôs a shred of decency in Trump; can I just say when they pass around total lies about both Nancy &amp; Hillary I go ü•ú?!
Even worse--he said "it would be an embarrassment to the US" when everyone knows that Trump is the GREATEST embarrassment to the US.
That is such great news and thank you President Trump we will never hear this on the news
Jordan, Gohmert, Nunes, D. Collins, the Trump Spawn &amp; spouses, Mulvaney, HuckaSanders, MacaNinny, Gaetz, Crazy Rudy, Rubio, Scott, DeSantis, Cornyn, Kemp, Cruz and everyone sitting at the Trump Hotel &amp; Bar Breeding Ground.   They can all go to Maralago and stay there.
That whacky doctor who backed Trump‚Äôs touting of hydroxychloroquine may have uncovered an important link to ‚Äúalien sex.‚Äù Apparently many of the women screwed by Trump describe it that way. Good time for a House Investigation. People might read this one. #DumpTrump2020
That poor family is being used as Trump-props. He's not going to get to the bottom of anything. He is incompetent-- non compos mentis.
What they are saying is that if Flynn is pardoned, he loses his 5thA rights and can be jailed to testify before a GJ.  If he refuses to testify, he could then be held in contempt. Of course. Trump could then pardon him from the Contempt and around the Merry Go Round we go.
By adding a question mark, Trump did not thereby change the necessary implication of his tweet, i.e. that the election should be postponed. Punctuation does not make an affirmative statement into a question if the meaning is otherwise clear.
Ali I can't believe we are here again worried about the Democrats stealing votes which we witnessed in Broward county Florida in 2018. Please listen President Trump ! Ali would be one of your best advisers .
Do you really think the current DOJ would haul Mike Flynn before a Grand Jury were Trump to pardon Flynn?

Help me here. I don't understand the concept of Maga. Trump has been president for more than 3 years now. Does the slogan has to be something like keep America great ? If greatness has not be achieved in last 3+ years, how he will achieve in next 4 years. I am not mocking.
This guy is such a disingenuous fool. Every single day Donald Trump does something that would have sent Conservatives into a frenzy had Obama done it. Obama speaks as a private citizen and Erickson is all righteous anger. What a hypocritical dope.

I feel no guilt in saying I have zero remorse for these people.  They encouraged millions to risk their lives to please Trump, and they led by example. Their deaths should serve as an example, too.  This is not a thing I would have said four years ago. Blame Trump &amp; his enablers.

Congrats   Another new record.  I bet if you keep opening more things you can kill more people!  Trump is so proud of how many people you have killed.
Should we do a Go-Fund-Me for the post office?   Trump has made us a pathetic country.
Which is why it was a lovely service. Nobody needs Donald Trump. We need a real president.
Trump you are the biggest fraud of a president this nation has ever seen.  You will pay big time for it.
Anybody seen Trump today?  No. I thought not.
Very SAD that now the Cowardly Liar Dotard Trump is asking COVID-19 patients for blood. Appropriate after trying to take away their health care, unemployment, food stamps, and jobs. Way to go asshole  Trump.
According to Cowardly Liar Dotard Trump,  DeSantis and  Gohmert, Republicans should not wear a face mask in public for fear of catching the COVID-19 virus, and should gather in large groups and share loud personal discussions in solidarity.
Judging by my Twitter timeline, I think I may be the only one who is quite pleased that Trump didn‚Äôt go to John Lewis‚Äô funeral.
Why sir are you concerned about mail in fraud? You have not been concerned about what your Senate intelligence Committee found with Russian involvement in the 2016 election in favor of Your golfing buddy Trump.
Trump Can‚Äôt Delay the Election‚ÄîSo He‚Äôs Trying to Make It a Chaotic Mess  because you don‚Äôt have the votes.  You don‚Äôt have the votes. You don‚Äôt have the votes. Yeahhhhhhh
Trump is so uneducated and ignorant he wouldn‚Äôt understand anything President Obama said in his eulogy. Trump has about 5 nouns and 10 pronouns and 3 verbs in his vocabulary.
Trump has no shame!
Congratulations on another day of record cases and deaths in Florida because you're a fucking idiot like your mentor Cowardly Liar Dotard   Trump.

Are you also wondering how many regular, ordinary, non-public figures also died as a result of the ill-advised Trump Tulsa rally that killed Herman Cain?  There are certainly others.
Remember this trump! RIP but if he had wore a mask üò∑ to YOUR reckless rally in Tulsa he would probably be alive today! trump the #coronavirus is NOT A #HoaxVirus it‚Äôs REAL which is why including Cain 150K‚¨ÜÔ∏èhave died while you advocate not wearing masksüò∑üëéüèΩ#NotMyPresident

Trump is a sad little man. Probably upset because absolutely no one wanted him there today. #PettyAsFuck
I don't think it's going to happen anyway but if Trump delays the election it may not trigger the mechanism that seats Nancy Pelosi. I think that she only becomes President if there isn't a result but an election has to take place?

Trump did a major disservice to the family of PFC Vanessa Guillen by having an event on the day of John Lewis's funeral and at the hour of President Obama's eulogy. They deserve to have their story heard. There is no way that the meeting had to be today.

I hope Trump listened and heard how real Presidents sound!

Trump should shut them down
Children want the normal they were promised. It isn‚Äôt happening because of the ineptitude of the Trump Admin &amp; the entire US government as a whole.  Even if we make it through this global  pandemic, we‚Äòre traumatizing young people, ruining their present &amp; destroying their future.
There seems to be an emerging trend at the funerals of American heroes - Barack Obama delivers a stirring eulogy and Donald Trump isn‚Äôt welcome to attend.

Just going out in a state that has 10k+ cases a day and higher than new york now with a governor that will never do anything cause he's a trump fanboy is... concerning
If the trend is your friend ... The trump notion of delaying The election ... would mean the Donald‚Äôs numbers will keep going down ... and the GOP with him

Finally you show the world the Dictator that you want to be. But it won't work for you and by January 20th, 2021 you will be shown to the door of the White House that you rented from me and you wasted my tax dollars for the past 4 years. No Mister Trump! I'll dance to your loss!

We need to end the debt ceiling, end government shutdowns, do more to bolster the Justice Department‚Äôs independence, abolish ICE, put new limits on executive power...  The GOP found so many ways to sabatoge Obama and enable Trump, and we can‚Äôt let that go on.
Looks like Dr Birx gave up trying to somehow educate Trump and is speaking truth to America. Late, but better than never. It will be interesting to see if Trump throws her under the same bus as he has thrown Fauci.
On one hand, Trump‚Äôs crimes are so many and so blatant, it‚Äôs hard to imagine them being ignored.  But I‚Äôll bet it‚Äôs also awfully tempting to just do what they did with Bush, and just focus on the legislative agenda.  And even there we probably won‚Äôt do enough.
Pelosi and Reid let Bush skate because they thought impeachment would be an electoral loser. When Obama won, no effort was made to punish members of the Bush administration for 8 years of lies and gross incompetence.  Trump already forced Pelosi to impeach, but will they do more?
My biggest fear is Trump somehow pulling out a win in November.  My second biggest fear is Democrats not being willing to do enough to repair all the damage when they‚Äôre back in power.  I am a proud Democrat, but one thing I‚Äôll never forget or forgive is how they dealt with Bush.
It‚Äôs a shame all 3 drank too much of Trump‚Äôs Kool-Aid and wouldn‚Äôt listen to science and the doctors
Unfortunately, we have consistently seen Trump stomping our laws and the Constitution.  Constant Impunity and refusing to follow subpoenas &amp; ignoring Supreme Court directives. Trump lawsuits have been his tactics for years. No service done minimizing danger from Trump &amp; Co.

#Trump is testing us.  We are smarter than he is
So how are our November elections looking
Trump has accomplished much criminality with complicit, Greedy &amp; likewise grafting Republican Congress with no ethics &amp; lies. Please make a note of it and understand the jeopardy.
Hoping nobody else who attended Trump‚Äôs ego show in Tulsa, OK, is ill or worse. #HermanCain
Golfing with Trump?
The question is how weak and desperate is Trump willing to appear?
Trump is another level
Vote the trump administration out completely
Donald J Trump is THE GREATEST EMBARRASSMENT TO THE USA!!!
We could all die and trump would not give a flying fuck. If you truly think he cares about you at all, you‚Äôre buying a narrative that expired decades ago
Trump 2020. If you want communism vote the other way. Government controlled every aspect of your life.
Please no one tell Trump that if there's no president elected by January 20th then Nancy Pelosi becomes president until one is elected. His reaction will be priceless.
Trump could hand Putin the nuclear codes in the middle of Fifth Avenue, and his supporters would still vote for him.
Herman Cain's death is on Trump's head. Cain got this at the Tulsa rally. Another good man lost due to  ineptitude.
Trump floats November election delay - but he can‚Äôt do that:  someone should give Trump copy of Constitution to read.
I agree with the statement however, Trump encourages his "followers" to endanger themselves and in doing so all of us.
Trump 2020.
You should probably have a look at that data ur suppressing. Priorities?
Oops wrong answer from the supposedly smartest guy in the room?? Pompeo is so smart that he constantly lies for trump and power. That‚Äôs pure evil.
Yesterday, I put out this tweet to highlight the dangerous stupidity of those forcing coronavirus on us &amp; mentioned the fact that Herman Cain, who got coronavirus after a Trump rally, was still in the hospital.  In light of the news that he has died, today I would call it murder.
Isn't this Hydroxychloroquine ban nuts?
PS: That all expires on July 31st. Come join the winning team and join other Republicans who have seen the light and support Joe Biden and Democrats who won't kiss Putin's ass and won't constantly let America down like Cowardly Liar Dotard Trump has constantly done.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
It is beginning to look like the Trump fans are bound and determined to commit suicide and take as many of the rest of us as they can with them. Or, they just really, really stupid!
I feel sad because this was so preventable.  They keep listening to Trump to their deaths and we are powerless to do anything to get them to listen.  I have tried reason, I have tried angry it‚Äôs no good.  They are just hypnotized by this con man. üò¢
I am not aware of the China Virus but the COVID-19 virus continues to cause unchecked havoc in America because America has a dumb-ass pig-headed Cowardly Liar Dotard Trump as our president until November when the FBI will arrest him for cowardly acts against America.
"A recipe for Disaster "             TRUMP
If He weren't Murdered by Trump in Tulsa you could have met him?
The pandemic is surging, race issues at all time important crossroads, worst economic numbers in history today, #JohnLewis has died, #Trump‚Äôs friend #HermanCain has died from a disease he caught at a  rally, 1,400 people died of #Covid yesterday... he tweets this
Actually sorry about this - he was one of the less toxic members of the Trump admin, and he had actually done some good in his life. But in the end, he got on the Trump Train, and it killed him. R.I.P.
Trump nationalizes it.
Does Cowardly Liar Dotard  even realize his phone calls with Putin are recorded by the FBI? He would be stupid not to. The FBI can't arrest him now because Trump's little bitch AG Barr said they can't. But after the November election they can.
so you agree that what Trump is trying to do with pushing back the election is treason?
Trump step down and take DOn JR and Eric trump with you.
Trump are you saying that when you lose , ur not leaving the ppls couse.
I think you should take as much Hydroxychloraquine as possible. Also, I encourage you to support the President by finding indoor Trump rallies/outdoor as well. Just remember masks are for the enemy of the people. DO NOT WEAR ONE! Thanks and have a nice day!
Ohhh. It‚Äôs a ‚Äúharmful idea‚Äù. So is the deaths of 153k citizens who are vastly more important that a grifter con man like trump.
This is sad. One line of thought is that he brought it on himself and endangered others. His, at best, naivete that led to his demise in a little over a month is still tragic. Responsible leadership from Donald Trump would go a long way to prevent unnecessary death
does  have proof President Trump killed Cain? Because that‚Äôs what it sounded like I just heard in a HARD NEWS report
Will this news encourage the right wing to wear a mask? He was last seen at Trump's rally in Tulsa without a mask,. Now he's dead.   Former GOP presidential candidate Herman Cain dies after battle with coronavirus
BREAKING: Herman Cain, has died from Covid 19. If you remember he attended the tRump rally with no mask. RIP.
Before people freak out:  No, Trump can‚Äôt actually delay the election. Only an act of congress can.  He floats dumb shit like this literally all the time cuz he has the impulse control of a toddler.  He constitutionally HAS to leave office on January 20 without an election.
Donald J Trump is trying to distract from the US GDP loss of 32.9%. He knows that he doesn't have the authority to change the date of the general election.
This is one of your crowning achievements. Like the 1,000‚Äôs of deaths, infrastructure, Trump Care and a 33% drop in our GDP.
Trump should b supporting our drug companies encouraging research and development....he is on the wrong side of the debate
TRUMP
Something broke in 2016 when Trump was elected president.
Trump tweeted the election stuff right as the GDP calculation comes out because he‚Äôs the worst president ever and still doesn‚Äôt have an actual plan to fix this country he‚Äôs just preserving his own wealth and power.
President Trump floats delaying the presidential election, citing his own prediction of fraudulent voting
I'm pretty much resigned to the idea that we won't make any meaningful headway until after the inauguration.  Assuming Trump loses and we have some form of blue wave.
Trump Trying to stop Nov election  Trump does not have the power himself to move the date of the election, which was set by an 1845 federal law placing it the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November The date could move theoretically with action by Congress.
Legally, this is called redlining. A charge Trump paid dearly for in the 1950s and 1960s. It led, quite rightly, to the 1968 Civil Rights Act. Trump is an evil con man. #DumpTrump2020
Trump did you listen the gdp dropped 33% in April May June 2020. The worst ever. However we have the worst president ever. November cannot come quick enough.
Trump is a ridiculous, tiny man.  I'm less frightened by him than I am furious of a GOP which has literally decided to stand by and watch him careen our democracy off a cliff.  Every one of them must go.
If Trump wants to have even a chance with women voters - QUIT SEPARATING CHILDREN  REMOVE CHILDREN FROM CAGES NOW! STOP BORDER DETENTIONS OR WE WILL VOTE YOU OUT, and LOCK YOU IN A CAGE with STEPHEN MILLER and a CONFEDERATE FLAG!
An NPR investigation has found irregularities in the process by which the Trump administration awarded a multi-million dollar contract to a Pittsburgh company to collect key data about Covid-19 from the country's hospitals in the midst of pandemic. Suspicious connections.
Trump just suggested that the 2020 election should be delayed because of possible voter fraud. We have paid  taxes by mail. The Census is done by mail. America voted through two world wars and Vietnam, often by mail. Trump used it. Trump is killing America. #DumpTrump2020
Donald Trump thinks that the Emergency Powers Act of 1976 gave him the power to postpone the election. He is right. The Emergency Powers Act of 1976 created the imperial presidency. We lost this battle 44 years ago. We are standing on the edge of the precipice.There will be blood
I'm sure the Republican controlled Senate would back Donald J Trump.
If the trumps don‚Äôt leave the building ... the transition will still go on ... they won‚Äôt be in charge  ... and will have put the trump brand beyond redemption ... and they will forever be untouchables for what they have done to America  ... perhaps that is the final comeuppance
Putin told his sad little bitch to do it and Trump always does what Putin tells him to do. Trump has still done nothing on Crimea except sending money to Russia to "help" Crimea. Maybe time to remove Trump by force?
I just can‚Äôt stand it when the word of the president is treated with such seriousness as this. Trump says things for attention, often in an incoherent way. The media adds context to his lies, we can‚Äôt be doing this if we want things to change.  Hope you &amp; the fam are safe &amp; well.
The only one who is a great embarrassment to the USA is Trump.
"Trump tells voters in suburbs they will ‚Äòno longer be bothered‚Äô by low-income housing"
So the flaccid Cowardly Liar Dotard Trump is building a railway to Mexico and a pipeline from Canada to Mexico that will spill oil across America just so rich oil billionaires can make more money. Republicans won't impeach Trump so America needs to vote Trump and Republicans out!
All they have to do is reverse the $3 Trillion tax cut they gave the rich 2 years ago. Why doesn‚Äôt some Democratic suggest that, I want to hear the GOP scream and yell how unfair it is. Trump created the problem we have today with the tax cut.Trump and Barr have NO power to delay the election. It‚Äôs just a distraction from his disastrous pandemic response and the worst economic downturn in US recorded history.
That‚Äôs because the left has no morals. Of course they used his funeral as a political platform. Look who‚Äôs their candidate! Sleepy dementia Joe. He‚Äôll NEVER debate President Trump. He doesn‚Äôt have the balls.
Why? He knew the facts yet ignored them. He was a cancer survivor so he knew he was compromised. His support of Trump was more important than his or his family's health...
If it is postponed, there will be an immediate cure for COVID-19! The msm will start focusing on the delayed elections and attack Trump.
So if Trump has been doing this since his first day in office.. why is ot still one of the largest problems we still have in America? Shouldnt it be solved or at least gotten better by now? ARE you suggesting #TrumpIsWeak
Fuck that  Medicare For All Cancel Student Debt Abolish Private Prisons Green New Deal Net Neutrality  Tuition Free College Housing For All Legalize Weed  You Republicans that paved the road for Trump to enter power do not get to dictate when or how we fight for our policies

So many Republicans are supporting Biden and expressing their dissatisfaction with trump.  Just repeating, if trump had run as a Democrat I would have voted Republican without blinking.   It's not about party or "my guy winning", it's about the right person and he's not it.
Something is missing in Trump. Something essential to being human. Bush made some very bad decisions and listened to some people he shouldn't have. He is a much better ex president then he was a president.

He‚Äôs the head of the Federalist society and just now says that trump is a fascist?  Wait. Haven‚Äôt we known that for three years?  The tweet this more all of a sudden turned him. Pfft.
Everything is a joke that trump says but really what happens when its not a joke none of us will ever believe in this liar in chief for anything. If his lips are moving he's Lying that's DERELICTION OF DUTY TRUMP YOU WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.
Lost the most American lives in recent history. No that was Trump. Worst Stock Market crash in recent history. Trump. Worst GDP contraction, ever. Trump again, Joe.

Experts dismiss Trump claim that it could take 'years' to declare election winner
Well, I‚Äôm glad you are coming around... please &amp; always, vote... Voting by mail has been done for a long long time and has less than .002% of fraud‚Äîthe only reason Trump doesn‚Äôt want vote by mail is because if people vote, he loses!
The one that pisses me off the worst is Trump 2020...no more bullshit.  As if the last 3 1/2 years have been anything but!
Provided we elect President Trump for 4 more years, we are vulnerable to these rejects all over again in 4 more years!
Why Trump Might Quit  via    I used to think the same thing but now Im convinced that  will dump Pence for Nikki Haley to show he too can have a female running mate

It‚Äôs because those reporters were chosen to ask those questions. Anyone with balls enough to ask about putin bounties or trump‚Äôs epic failure on c19 might receive an angry tweet or lose access. Oh the horror.
Don‚Äôt you think he was tested before he was allowed so close to Trump? Herman Cain is tragedy but it‚Äôs about individual choices.
Does Trump even realize that older people get their insulin and other very important medications via the USPS. They have done this month after month and their lives depend on it.
Getting rid of kushner is just as important as ousting trump.  The Biden team needs to campaign on the entire team of asshats that will be gone when he‚Äôs elected. It‚Äôs a huge selling point.
Of course he is. Trump is going to undermine the results and declare himself the winner. Welcome to authoritarian rule! Democracy and the USA is finished.
This is why Donald Trump is president. Racists like this.
Well at least it‚Äôll backfire on trump. His approval was low during the government shutdown.
Absolutely correct, Governor DeSantis sits at the knee of Trump, both must be voted out
Trump does not care about Americans period he‚Äôs a socio pathic career narcissist and we don‚Äôt need Mary trumps book to tell us that. He‚Äôs a career liar .
Trump‚Äôs comments on rescheduling the elections convinces me further that he won‚Äôt accept the election results if he loses.
Our idiot Governor DeathSantis is listening to his master Trump. He's a darn mini Trump. He's going to get voted out.
Trump‚Äôs voter fraud and mail in voting tweets have no evidence. He is supplying false information.
No. I didn't get to make my point. Would you mind listing the things Trump has done if it's convenient?

Too late, he sat by and did nothing while Trump betrayed his oath, our country and allies.
Remember over the spring many ‚Äúprimaries‚Äù got delayed/changed to accomodate the shut down. State govs may be inclined to change election dates/mail by dates in an effort to ‚Äúaccomodate‚Äù (ie: round up) voters.   Trump knows whatever he proposes Dems will be against. HydroxyC, etc.
That didn't age well.. I don't want to speak ill will of the dead but he was a grown man that chose to ride or die with this hoax and paid for it. he literally died for Trump.
Trump's admiration of dictators probably getting lessons on how to take a democracy to a authoritarian dictatorship using our own judiciary and laws against us.
I believe Trump is responsible for all the COVID deaths
Dana Perino! Wasn't she the press secretary  for Bush? That was the worst administration in history...I mean until the Trump administration
The covid response was a total disaster for Trump. Instead of asserting himself as a strong leader who didn‚Äôt prescribe to the mob mentally he went along with the narrative from the shutdown imbeciles and lunatics. If anything is going to be his undoing it will be this.

I actually do get along with him. We just disagree on Trump. Thanks for your input, I feel like a much more fulfilled human being. Don't forget to inject bleach against COVID-19 and protect yourself at night from demon sex..
I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any evidence to support your claim that Trump wants to place black people below white people. There have been no actions or statements that support that. I was trying to go straight for WHY you would perceive things that way.
Don't believe this guy; he's as anti trump as they come. "Science" is trash when the analysis is designed to come out a certain way.  #hydroxichloroquine
save the USPS. Trump will defund until there is no mail at all.
Trump said that he could shoot somebody and they'd still support him. Well he didn't need a gun in this case.
That reasoning never crossed Trump‚Äôs mind.
Pogue is an anti-trump with 100s of anti-trump tweets, including disparaging tweets about Sarah Sanders.  Which means his "analysis" has ZERO credibility. He has a clear agenda.  #Hydroxychloroquine
Here‚Äôs Herman Cain at Trump‚Äôs Tulsa Campaign Rally where he likely contracted COVID. No mask. No social distancing.  Stupidly following Donald Trump in denial of the virus... #TrumpKillsAmerica

Remember Republicans were the ones who fought against every election integrity bill! Follow their money to Diabold who makes the voting machines. It all comes together as to WHY they are so terrified with mail in voting.they need to cheat to win. FUCK TRUMP
Again, it‚Äôs trump saying something without doing something. Bark vs bite. Amazing people haven‚Äôt figured that out yet. Everyone calm down.

Trump doesn‚Äôt care if more of his voters vote by mail. Trump doesn‚Äôt care if vote by mail is popular. The best opportunity Republicans have to suppress the vote is by reducing the number of urban voting sites where voters can vote. That‚Äôs the plan!
First of all, Pomeo‚Äôs smirk aside, he‚Äôs clearly not in in ‚Äúthe joke‚Äù, secondly, didn‚Äôt Trump tell us recently he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt kid‚Äù?
You honestly believe there is no possibility of voter fraud with millions of ballots floating around?   What if GOP wins, are you still going to take that position?  Is this exactly why Trump is making these statements? To take away Left arguments of ‚Äúfraud‚Äù once he wins?  ü§≠ü§îüßê

History will remember Donald Trump in one way and one way only: as an accessory to the murder of tens of thousands of Americans. And amazing legacy

Very apparent, Trump will never be called eulogize anyone....besides, will they let him out of prison to do it.
Your right it‚Äôs just disappointing to have Trump as our President
Thank you! He praised Trump 4 not making masks mandatory for the July 4th rally. He said (in caps): "people are fed up". He was a selfish pig. I save my sadness 4 the innocent pple who died because of them. The chickens have come home to roost! Ana is not rude just factual!

I want all trump administration gone ASAP and GOP. They are all scum. The ride has been very bad. Killing Americans should have been stopped. We stopped being USA. A lot of people need to lose their jobs in the next administration. FBI and CIA and generals. All at the top.

Why not flip flop it would extend your demise. If you support trump you‚Äôre a racist.
Biden did not say that Trump will achieve it, Biden said that he would try. In in fact, thats what Trump said he wants to do. So you  were/are wrong.
Or goes to jail... Cain was a big boy. He, along w/ Trump &amp; the rest of the goons, have caused many innocent people to die. He praised Trump 4 not making masks mandatory for the July 4th rally &amp; said that "people are fed up" (in caps). They deleted it today.
He needs flippers &amp; a Speedo!
Completely agree. But theres that filibuster rule, etc, plus each member of the senate would have to give a little speach abt why Trump is evil, etc.   Maybe they could do it faster. Obvi, it would be priority #1. Trump would be on lockdown!!  Lol

Never

Today Trump suggested delaying the election. Obama was reinforcing John Lewis' belief "When you see something that is not right, you must do something," "Democracy is not a state. It is an act, and each generation must do its part."
And Trump voters are conservative, so what does that make him? Your claim was specious and an attempt to discredit the original point, which is that by and large Republicans and far right groups are the biggest pushers re: reopening/masks are ineffective/covid conspiracies.

U act like Biden hasn‚Äôt said that same thing on the campaign trail. He constantly compares Trump to Wallace and Bull Conor. I have proof if u need it.
This tweet was actually too dumb to be 4th Dimensional Chess. The Constitution is rather firm about this, so this has to be part of Trump‚Äôs fiendishly clever plan to Make Biden Lucid Again...Why are Trump supporters so ugly ü§¢
FU Graham!! Stop pandering to trump for once! You KNOW that election fraud is basically nonexistent! To get a ballot you MUST be registered, the ballot MUST be sent to the registered address and the signature on file MUST match the returned ballot. THEIR IS NO FRAUD!
I guess scumbag trump can‚Äôt hear well, I am sure Nancy will have the voting done honest and fair and on time, but now would be a good time since it it ok to send kids back to school

Why I have no problem calling libs "Mask Nazis".  There is no proof Cain caught Corona at Trump rally.    If he got near any protestor at Trump rally...that protestor could have been carrier...many of them at BLM Protest with Al Sharpton night before
I wish you had this same energy when we found out trump knew about Russian Bounties on US soldiers and still haven‚Äôt did anything about it !!
Yeah, bullshit. That‚Äôs the official Republican excuse every time Trump says something racist,  illegal or flat out stupid. He was ‚Äújoking.‚Äù Pathetic. üôÑ
To watch the lemmings in the media follow it off the cliff  . . . hysterical. People think Trump's dumb,  and sometimes they are right, other times he's playing them like a fiddle.
WISHFUL THINKING TRUMP YOU ARE PACKING YOUR BAGS IN NOVEMBER!!!
you bemoan Trump using mail-in ballots as a device to change the subject from Covid or the GDP plunge but then all you do is talk about his mail-in bs. You're victims. cc
I can see this happening but it‚Äôs a bad idea because it would do the opposite. The next president has a responsibility to hold trump accountable.
Lmao you must have been living under a rock this year. Trump did more harm to America this year alone than all 8 of Obama's years. The 150,000+ deaths are on Trump's hands. They're stained with the blood of Americans.
It was horrible listening to his bullshit !   Obama is a uniting voice for everyone.  Trump only want cc white supremacy
What if a foreign government came to monitor the elections so Trump can‚Äôt cheat.
Might want to look at the environment around you. Where people are being forced to wear ankle monitors just because they MIGHT be sick. That's not Trump doing that. But, then again, Obama was the only logical person on the Left.
Donald Trump should resign, pass it on
I don‚Äôt know whether to cheer or be suspicious.
Great!  But, ‚Å¶ - This doesn‚Äôt even come close to redeeming yourself from your utter #Covid fiasco. And I pledge to do everything I can to see you NEVER hold public office again in my State.
Trump has a press conference spouting nonsense about other countries' covid problems. The media then takes the bait and argues about that instead of telling us the facts about the US. Wise up. Remember 2016. Shiny objects. Get it.
If Trump contests the election, we better take to the fucking streets.
Trump will NEVER have that.
I'm not concerned about what you are doing. I relish questions to our leaders. First question, why did Trump ignore the virus potential for months? Why did he brag about grabbing pussy? Why did he have raw dog sex with a porn star?
Do you realize that you're trolling Trump with that tweet.
personally, I‚Äôm shocked Ron DeSantis hasn‚Äôt done this immediately after Trump‚Äôs tweet, considering how quickly he agreed to open schools after Trump said he wanted schools open.
Trump couldn‚Äôt write better commercials himself üá∫üá∏ #Trump2020Landslide
what would be more fun? just quickly picking up trump then throwing him out onto pennsylvania ave, or a slow and agonizing drag from the wh residence, onto the ellipse, out the gates? "no, no, very unfair, polls were rigged!" the whole way
its never happening but can you imagine if biden won then asked for volunteers to remove trump after he refused to leave? the line would be so long. we could raffle tickets and fund health care for a year.
Add in Dc and PR and Dems will hold power for decades     ...Trump is saving this country #FourMoreYears
If both Trump and McConnell lose, it will be a dangerous time.
Trump looks so scared/surprised like he ended up in the wrong place
No covid19 vaccines üíâ for me under any circumstances. Any and all circumstances NO VACCINES
RIP Herman Cain.  He attended the infamous Trump Rally in Tulsa in June without a mask and no social distancing.  His COVID-19 illness erupted in July.  Enough said.  This is not a hoax -- everyone should take this pandemic seriously!
Had Cain went to the BLM event the night before in Tulsa...nothing would be said.  However...he was at a Trump Rally...
Throughout this, I've often thought that if I were an epidemiologist or virologist, I'd say "screw, y'all!" and move to a country where I don't receive death threats or accusations of being a Marxist who wants to destroy America whenever I share research that contradicts Trump.
Is this like when Trump said he‚Äôd have a big scoop on Bill &amp; Hillary the following Tuesday or when he said Melania will have a news conference about her resume‚Äô, still waiting for both.
Wonder how Trudeau backers feeling as it came out their Liberal Wunderkind has been using US Republican (Trump's Party) Marco Rubio's campaign staff in some of his shennanigans üòÅ
You sure got a point, Brother Bakari, but, then again, it was "Us" against the Electoral College, Trump, and Putin. We were outnumbered.
You have missed the point. He was blasting Trump during a funeral service. Btw I support Trump. I have a MBA, and am not stupid. Like most crass liberals. You are quick to say diversity and inclusion but quick to criticize  those who you disagree with. Hypocrite.
When  crushes  on November 3rd and Trump‚Äôs team starts floating the idea of a pardon, I hope Biden laughs in their faces.  Also, I wonder if  has started making plans for dying in prison of old age.
Herman Cain just as likely caught CoronaVirus from BLM Antifa Protest hosted by Al Sharpton, held nite before Trump Rally  Event had staff work BOTH events, &amp; were most likely to get close to Cain during entering rally venue.  Trump Rally moved up 1 day due to BLM #RIPHermanCain
I trust President Trump, I don‚Äôt trust Dr Fauci or Bill Gates. HCQ + Zpac + Zinc is the answer to Covid19. Why did they conspire to allow the deaths of 150,000 Americans and counting ? Why do they continue to conspire to kill Americans ? For money üí∞ ? For partisan politics ? üôèüèΩ
He boycotted 45 inauguration based on Hillary lies and called Trump illegitimate
Are you talking about me and me family? Because we voted for Hillary in 2016, we are Latinos. And we are going to vote for Trump first time
Good luck with that, Kamala.  Count me as one who didn‚Äôt vote in 2016 who will vote Trump in 2020, and Republican straight down the ballot.  My 3 kids also didn‚Äôt vote in 2016, and are all with MAGA.  In Florida.
So...doesn't seem to have helped much. We have 4% of the world population and 25% of the deaths. Doesn't look like anything Trump did helped. He's still not helping. Let's not forget he's hyping treatments the FDA did not approve. Ignored wearing a mask for months. SAD!!!
Trump is such a baby.
Donald Trump is a Trojan fighting on a horse defending us from Russia. Pass it on!
When this goddam  nightmare is finally over and gone, we are going to find out Trump‚Äôs  &amp; most Republican Governor‚Äôs pathetic response to #Covid was a purposeful attempt to keep voters from the polls. They were &amp; are WILLING TO LET AMERICANS DIE!
Trump Derangement Syndrome may kill you faster than Covid 19, you may want to take a chill pill!
For anyone who says No, move to another country. Because the only reason for not liking Trump is because he loves this country, its history and the patriotic citizens.
With  ‚ÄúDelay the election‚Äù tweet, is there anyone else but me beginning to think Trump could possibly not win a single Electoral College vote and  will win all 50 States &amp; 1/2 dozen territories!  Fewer people each minute wil not be #DyingForTrump.
The sad part is they had him sign a liability waiver. He had to know at that point what he was getting into or maybe not,  maybe just being the sacrificial lamb for trump?
Says the person who‚Äôs been protecting trump.
McConnell and other top Republican officials rebuff Trump suggestion to delay the Nov. 3 election - The Washington Post
I‚Äôm going to the booth and vote.  Trump is a snake.
Just because 1/3 of the country is enthusiastic doesn‚Äôt mean trump will win, pretty simple to understand lol
Aaaaaaand there it is, folks. He is threatening our democracy. If Trump could have his way, we would never be allowed to vote again.  Get registered. Vote.
Remember, Trump has repeatedly stated that he never jokes, and that everything he says is the literal truth
How can u be so stupid to still believe Trump called the virus and not the democrats and media response to it avhoax
Well, after 8 years of Barack "more flexibility" Obama bending over and taking it from Putin, Trump decided to face him.
Brilliant move by Trump though. We know mail in voting will have issues, if Trump wins, and Dems cry foul, he says I told you so. If he loses, it will be a stain on Biden's election as we continue to find uncounted ballots through 2022.
Trump suggests delaying November election  As usual, the press, this time the BLACK press has lived p to its reputation as FAKE NEWS, and they only do it because they know their constituents are too intellectually lazy to check the facts for themselves
If mail-in ballots are good enough for Trump‚Äôs base, they‚Äôre good enough for ALL voters.
If the wicked is Trump i support you
Remember during one of the investigative hearings for the impeachment of  Trump‚Äôs Chief of Staff  had a cow about the insinuation he was racist and offered his long relationship with  Is Meadows at the funeral or did Trump stop him.
Trump tried to keep Covid out and you leftists played the race card ad nauseam to keep him from doing anything regardless. STFU!
For God‚Äôs sake, Biden &amp; Bolshevik Bernie are on VIDEO admitting they wouldn‚Äôt have done anything to stop Covid regardless and we wouldn‚Äôt have even known about it. Only reason we even know of it and doing anything is because ‚ÄúTrump is POTUS and we must play games regardless.‚Äù
Especially when Democrats tried to prevent Trump from doing anything about Covid, using the tired ‚Äúracism‚Äù card even.
Of course. We wouldn't expect any less from this loser, his Administration &amp; his followers who I refuse 2 give up on although it seems more apparent every day that if you still support  then you must be Evil yourself.  #RESISTANCE WILL WIN
Darlin, NOBODY makes  face look more orange. He takes care of that himself in the tanning bed he installed in the White House.   Trump won‚Äôt sunbathe like normal people because he‚Äôs afraid of being mistaken for a beached whale.
Pretty much. Much of it being thinly veiled ‚Äúhe should‚Äôve worn a mask! Trump killed him!‚Äù smugness.
‚ÄúOh but Herman Cain didn‚Äôt wear a mask hurt durr!‚Äù And? You leftists kept playing the racism card to spite Trump anyway regardless of what he did to try and prevent Covid in the first place. Don‚Äôt pretend you ever cared about  in the first place.
That would guarantee a Trump re-election.
It‚Äôs one thing to not like Trump or any politician and yet be fair in your criticism. It‚Äôs another thing to continually err &amp; then blame the opposition when you‚Äôre the one at fault. Again, see Democrats using the race card to stop Trump from preventing Covid entry into the US.
I guarantee one thing Trump talked to Putin about was fleeing to Russia as an exile before or right after the election on the Trump Organization plane full of traitors like #BenedictBarr,  Pence and the rest of Trump‚Äôs Cabinet.
In 1 video  said ‚Äúto be defined by your enemies is to be nothing at all.‚Äù Which is exactly what the Left is. No matter what Trump does no matter how reasonable they blame him because they STILL can‚Äôt take the L. And they continue to show it with  passing
Donald Trump is terrified because he knows his presidency is crumbling before his eyes and his attempts to use attacks by his #GestapoGoons is backfiring.
"Cain had attended Trump‚Äôs rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, less than two weeks before receiving his diagnosis."
Could Trump have handled Covid better? Sure. But stop pretending he‚Äôs the only one at fault when Commie China fanned it out in the first place. Not to mention the Democrats fought against him using the tired ‚Äúracism‚Äù card when he wanted to temporarily shut off flights.
All these things can be true at the same time: - Trump is morally unfit for office. - Biden is morally unfit for office. - Trump has helped millions of Americans. - Trump has ignored the plight of millions of human beings. - The only good thing about Biden is that he isn't Trump.
I am so sick of Trump's  attack ads on Biden. Biden doesnt attack Trump. Hes an honest person and I hope he will be our next President!
Running on his record is automatic defeat. Bye bye Trump
re herman cain's death  the trump people - including his son - keep attacking biden for not having traditional campaign events.   joe biden's campaign events never killed anyone. trump's rally did.

But the worst part of the tweet isn't that it didn't age well, it's that making an allegation without proof is irresponsible.  As if Trump never does that.
And to think that the coronavirus may end up going down in American history as only the second most monumental event of 2020.   I know Trump doesn't technically have the power to do this, but do any of us think this is going to end well?
sorry but empty platitudes of what trump can't do while *nobody* in power does *anything* to rein him in does not mollify me

Trump‚Äôs completely oblivious to that.

Who has been pushing the violence? The Democrats, ever since Trump won the election, you are are just pawns for the DNC, they don't care about y'all, only your votes. Remember Maxine Waters saying if you see Republicans eating dinner at a restaurant call them out? You ARE hate.
I saw so much donald trump in his promo. Good cus I mean you know heels draw heat i guess lol
Trump is unable to be a president.  Congress needs to step in.
It is so disgusting to watch an AG that has no respect for the law or anyone except Trump.  I hope they can be held accountable but it won‚Äôt be until they leave office. Just counting the days.
Trump gets confused and thinks it‚Äôs Melania saying ‚Äúno erection for you.‚Äù
I apologize I thought you asked me to read the AFFH legislation which I know inside and out because it affected my industry.  It's not a bad thing that Trump is doing. It's actually helping to keep another housing crash from happening.  He's way ahead of all of us..noone gets it
Trump votes by mail using an address that he doesn‚Äôt reside in... you can just request a vote by mail balllet in FL.. this is a dumb hill to die on for Republicans considering everyone in the White House does it now..
And what does that have to do with the price of real estate? Nothing...God said to be charitable and kind..he also said to be aware of the serpents in the temple...and he has warriors...the Dems have made a temple unto themselves ...Trump is tearing it down for us.

Their's literal video evidence of this. Watch Trump's 4th of July from Mount Rushmore or his rally compared to any virtual interview or staged speech Joe has done the last 5 months. Joe won't even take any unapproved questions. Open your eyes.
What, not enough money because Trump has been siphoning off cash to himself and his cronies?
Still keeping with your discriminitory housing record from the 70's eh Mr. President. At least you haven't surprised me yet.
Biden calls the demon seed woman a "disgrace" and calls out Trump for pushing her nonsense.
if they open up Biden will have to debate Trump live on stage. This lockdown is of course going thru the election.
He LITERALLY cannot do an interview or press conference without pre written questions and notes for his answers. Trump can stand in front of a crowd and speak for 2 hours, joe can't do 5 minutes.

So self respecting woman votes for Trump.  Every mom I know is sick and tired of the dangerous and divisive DJT bullshit train and will be voting straight blue this year.    ...and I'll be looking forward to seeing #denialdonald removed forcefully on  inauguration day.
Heels up Harris. Fraud liar and cheat. Vote for Trump and Straight Republican in 2020.
What happened to Herman Cain was predicted.  Trump knew it would happen to a percentage of attendees.  That‚Äôs why he made them sign a liability waiver.  He was ok with it as long as he got to have his rally.  I can‚Äôt understand why both sides aren‚Äôt outraged.
Imbecil, that's why Trump did prison reform, because police, including elite FBI, bully people into taking a plea. They do it to minorities too often or any one who is their enemy. These agencies have too much power.
Sounds like Trump is trying to cheat by electronic voting and vote by mail blocks that.
It‚Äôs fairly clear that he chose to vilify the science behind mask use to please Trump. He put his faith in a charlatan rather than the true experts. That loyalty ultimately cost him his life.
Trump led Herman Cain to the gates of Hell.
This is a very nice tribute from President Trump.

Yes Herman Cain passed from Covid likely picking it up at a trump rally.  How many others have passed on who don‚Äôt have the name recognition that Cain did from that same rally?  Trump could care less
Dear momma :) . Want to hear some bars from Kanye? How about a 30 min interview with by charlamagne tha god?
Hey Robbie. Have you read Mary Trump‚Äôs book?  Lots and lots of early tells.
The color of evil is putrid Orange to think a president could actually delay the elections is ridiculous? Trump you have no power to delay the election! It won't happen! You might try to sue 36 or 37 States when you lose to Joe Biden but it won't work! #dumpTrump
That reasoning never crossed Trump‚Äôs mind.

There was a time when I thought it couldn't get worse than Dubya, but in the face of what we're going through he's looking mighty fine these days.    This is what real leadership looks like, and Trump having no presidential qualities is another reason #WhyIDontLikeTrump

A virus he caught at a rally in Tulsa that Trump insisted on having despite the recommendations of experts.  Clearly, #TrumpVirus and #TulsaRallyVirus are both more appropriate.

Trump again throwing meat to the media about this "delay the election" talk..what he tryna distract us from?
The Donald Trump Presidency.
Juan Williams saying Trump is a sore loser is amazing considering he‚Äôs 1-0 in elections so literally he has never lost.
Yesterday trump was trying to scare people from black and brown people who could possibly move into their neighborhoods and lower their house prices, today he wanted to postpone the election and this is your message?
Greatings brothers, would it be too much to ask for a min of you time or a reshare ?
In totally agree. Would it be too much to ask a ally for a minute to assist our a black radio show host?
What more does McConnell want out of trump, he could make trump resign tomorrow and run with pence and haley, but this is the party of trump...they are all trump now.
I hear ya.  Hobby Lobby, Chick-fil-A, and Trump rallies too.
THE GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT DROPPED 32.9% IN THE SECOND QUARTER. tRump doesn't want you to know this. That's why he floated the idea of delaying the election. DISTRACTION!! Whatever you do, DO NOT RETWEET THIS!

Lewis showed nothing but contempt for President Trump, why should he bother?
Think about this one. I have seen every past president be able to cite Bible verses like Obama did in today‚Äôs eulogy. But never once from Trump. What a fraud.
Obama‚Äôs eulogy was very inspiring. I miss a President who can deliver an inspirational message that is positive and filled with unity and hope. We lost something precious when we got saddled with Trump.
I want all trump administration gone ASAP and GOP. They are all scum. The ride has been very bad. Killing Americans should have been stopped. We stopped being USA. A lot of people need to lose their jobs in the next administration. FBI and CIA and generals. All at the top.
doesn't care, he's a loyalist.  But he better be careful, those close to Trump are testing positive and now sadly dying. I do not know if DeSantis has any health issues other than being overweight. Maybe his  family can be of influence for his sake if not for ours
Judging by my Twitter timeline, I think I may be the only one who is quite pleased that Trump didn‚Äôt go to John Lewis‚Äô funeral.
And Trump has the audacity to offer condolences to Mr. Cain's grieving family without taking responsibility for hosting a senseless rally during a global pandemic.
And nobody knew it until ‚ÄúProfessor‚Äù Trump told us.
And trump doesn't care because he has no soul!
Chip in ANY AMOUNT to attend the virtual grassroots fundraiser with  and  on Friday and let‚Äôs sweep Donald Trump into the dustbin of history.
Are you also wondering how many regular, ordinary, non-public figures also died as a result of the ill-advised Trump Tulsa rally that killed Herman Cain?  There are certainly others.
Trump is a sad little man. Probably upset because absolutely no one wanted him there today. #PettyAsFuck

Trump has mishandled crises, 150,000 of our fellow Americans are dead, we continue to grapple with systematic racism &amp; we have a careless BIGOT who could not care less if things got worse because he‚Äôs making them worse. Let us listen to Obama and VOTE!!!! VOTE EVERY ENABLER OUT!
Given the way he's running his campaign, you have to wonder:  What does the President have on Donald J. Trump?
Trump and Barr are unconstitutional thugs running Stormtroopers in cities, yet many want a national mask mandate and Federal law enforcement out there arresting people not wearing. Bet if a guy got gassed,  beat and dragged off by cops for no mask they would cheer it
What I would expect on  tonight. Top story will be a live report from the NY pizza restaurant that trump tweeted out. In the 57th minute, there will be a snippet of video of Obama, Bush and Clinton speaking at John Lewis service
Even if delayed, Trump still leaves office at noon on January 20th, 2021. Absolutely nothing changes that.
Trump could never give a speech/eulogy because he can't talk about anyone but himself.  I love and miss Obama so much!!
No one there wanted trump to say a damn thing.
Donald Trump will NEVER upstage President Barack Hussein Obama!

There seems to be an emerging trend at the funerals of American heroes - Barack Obama delivers a stirring eulogy and Donald Trump isn‚Äôt welcome to attend.
The press Corp is paid to be there. Just add the context. trump is doing this to take attention away from John Lewis's funeral.   trump is acting like a toddler who wants attention. He will babble like a toddler.

We could all die and trump would not give a flying fuck. If you truly think he cares about you at all, you‚Äôre buying a narrative that expired decades ago
Trump attended a fundraiser in Texas without a mask on the day the US hit 150,000 coronavirus deaths. In addition to all his bad qualities, he's a hypocrite too.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.

Today many Republican congressmen will be asked about Trump's tweet and they will all have mysteriously not seen it.
Trump sent out the tweet just as the historically low GDP numbers crossed the wires. His failure to manage the health of the country has caused massive failure in the economy. And now he has nothing to run on other than spreading division and fear if the "others".
YEP, THERE IS 5,000 REASON NOT TO VOTE FOR TRUMP...ONE IS HIS IQ IS 40, HE DOES NOT READ, TAKES NO BRIEFING, CALLS PEOPLE UGLY DISGUSTING NAMES LIKE A 5-YEAR-OLD BULLY, HAS NO SENSE OF DIRECTION, AND HE LOVES DICTATORS. THES ARE JUST A FEW...THE LIS GOES ON AND ON.
Trump tweeted the election stuff right as the GDP calculation comes out because he‚Äôs the worst president ever and still doesn‚Äôt have an actual plan to fix this country he‚Äôs just preserving his own wealth and power.
Then why is Trump doing nothing to show proof and make it available?

Oh my goodness, Donald Trump says that NJ has only one person under the age of 18 that dief. Doesn't he realize that children have died across the USA also under the age of 18?  I think we've had even children under the age of five who died.  This man makes me ill.

Trump has lost a Federalist Society founder by tweeting about moving the election date. After tolerating caging children and pissing on the U.S. Constitution and rule of law it‚Äôs funny to see what it takes for Trump to finally grab a hypocrite by the pussy.  They know he‚Äôs toast.

I think Ma -a Largo should be designated a virus detention center as they used an island to seperates the plague carriers from the rest .Have Trump  cater to them for their needs ( continue to shuck a mask ).
Donald Trump is responsible for every single person that died in the USA because of #COVID19 (except the first 15 people).    There may have been many Trump supporters that died and at some point Donald Trump needs to FUCKING wake up.
Trump is not capable of having friends. He alone, along with Herman Cain's lack of critical thinking, bear the responsibility of his passing. Removing the safe distance signs, no masks all contributed to this outcome. Very sad.

More proof, as if it was needed, that Trump is an anti-American autocrat that does not believe in freedom, justice, democracy, and especially the Constitution.
You should delete it. Retweeting something like this is equivalent to trump retweeting the hydromoronqueen dr who also thinks alien ejaculate causes demons or wtf ever.

Donald Trump could NEVER stand up in a church, among the family and friends and talk ONLY about John Lewis.    He doesn't know how to do that at all.
Do you remember yesterday?  Lmao. Trump the idiot had a "team" the last election for voter fraud. Evidence: ZERO. source you ask? No problem. üòâ
It's what Mitch McConnell will do that will be a huge problem.  What Trump does, kits of it can be reversed.  Remember when Trump reversed all of Obama's stuff? Joe plans to change it back.
I'll be voting by mail, as I have in Florida since I became eligible to vote.  But make no mistake...if that was not an option, I would belly crawl through a field of broken glass and salt to cast a vote against Trump in November.
People are risking their lives for Trump and money they don't need. Insane
They're blaming it on Trump.
Herman Cain was killed by Trump's negligence holding the Tulsa rally. Trump led those poor souls to their death! How many more people have died or will die because of Trumps Negligence? Shame on all involved with Trump!
Donald J Trump actions in Tulsa is no different than the actions of mass muderer Jim Jones! Trump packed people into convention hall knowing he was going to kill some of them!
Herman Cains death is on Donald J Trump! There are videos of your employees removing dont sit here stickers so you could pack people in! Your a murderer
Trump cancelling the fair housing program that Obama initiated was a  act to put down a court decision against Fred Trump ( his father ) who tried to block the poor and black trying to get a step up in housing capabilities .In essence catering to the white affluent population.
And your thoughts of Trump and Putin?
Herman Cain was infected at the Tulsa,OK Trump rally. The rally where experts said it was to dangerous to hold!  Cain paid the ultimate price for following Trumps crazy policies. Wake up America Trump is only worried about what is best for Trump! #DumpTrump2020
32.9% decline in GDP. Is this what Trump calls winning?
I remember commenting the day that Herman Cain's photo was up at the Trump rally on June 20th, and now, just a little over a month later Mr. Cain has died of the coronavirus.  This is real PEOPLE, pay attention.  üëáüëáüëá

After this whole discussion, what is your interest in this topic? You seem very invested in complaining about all the Trump policies and his ineffectiveness as president. These are all opinion on your part and yet you haven't shown me verifiable proof of any of it.

Trump rescinded Obama's fair housing rule.Trying to keep the suburbs for the upper class .Blacks are targeted with this bias  happening .What he's  doing is loading up on the white votes paying attention to disparity in  population percentages, black verses whites .
Note how well these states have done in the last few years under President Trump.
isnt it telling that when Obama was president and he delt with the party of " No" as per orders from Rush Limbaugh,.that he never used executive orders as Trump so freely uses  ? Imagine the s..t storm if he had, from the right  ?
The policies Trump has pushed has created an economic boom, until covid came around. More money flowing and more people working. Is that a bad thing? Or is it better for people to rely on govt, and not themselves. Teach a man to fish and he'll have a way to eat. no?
The fastest responding President ever works harder than all other low life POLITICANS. JFK had to play games with our National Sex symbol. Obama screwed his own people. Trump made America great until Mike Bloomberg paid Wuhan Lab workers to concoct Coronavirus and release it.
President Trump is dealing with Covid-19 virus, the terrorist riots in RAT run Cities, a nasty, dirty D'RAT campaign  plus his own, China, Russia, etc...  All of these demands plus more at once without any Help from the D'RATs!! The unjustified  Attacks are getting worst!!

I believe that we occupied Germany to keep Russia out.  Besides, if we did have to fight Russians, I'm sure everyone would rather have a war in Europe, as opposed to a war in this country  I understand Trump's position, but leaving Europe to its own devices isn't safe.
Hummm, one on one picture taking today, in Texas with Donald Trump.  This should be interesting.

Lets use our energy to vote Trump out of office and that will remove Barr from office as well.  The senate will never convict Barr.
Is there any country we used to be on good terms with that trump has not betrayed?
Good thing Obama's not in charge. He waited 6 months to react to his H1N1 pandemic - I guess he was too busy being told to take over of our healthcare system.  Trump reacted on day one.
Wait, so you think people who live in suburbs are white and all poor people are black? And you think TRUMP is the racist?

Well it is becoming clear that Trump's covid-19 press conferences are some of the best advertising Biden can get!  The more Trump talks the more people want to vote for Biden! #DumpTrump
How Trump's coronavirus briefings convinced one of his voters to turn to Joe Biden
What has this countries standards been lowered to ? Trump received intel of bountys being paid by Putin to kill American troops . This alone should cause doubt about Trumps  qualification to lead .
It looks like Trump is handing Putin another gift pulling the troops out of Germany! Is it November 3 yet?
Likeing, as I do, Kamala Harris , Biden should measure baggage pointed out in her rise to her station . Biden is moving against the tide as it is . Trump will throw everything at him whether true or not .Play safe , Joe . Think about Duckworth for instance .
This has nothing to do with Trump. I read a French report and shared it with my very sick friend. It is a true story. It is my story and it is not political. You are just so negative.
Another good Trump decision for the American people however Anything good he does is never reported by network news

News flash,statement uttered by Donald Trump is found to be TRUE!
President Trump has a lot of great points that he just doesn‚Äôt use.  The biggest tax break to a family is the Child Deduction.  Ask families with children if they want to lose that.Trump and Barr have NO power to delay the election. It‚Äôs just a distraction from his disastrous pandemic response and the worst economic downturn in US recorded history.
That‚Äôs because the left has no morals. Of course they used his funeral as a political platform. Look who‚Äôs their candidate! Sleepy dementia Joe. He‚Äôll NEVER debate President Trump. He doesn‚Äôt have the balls.
Why? He knew the facts yet ignored them. He was a cancer survivor so he knew he was compromised. His support of Trump was more important than his or his family's health...
If it is postponed, there will be an immediate cure for COVID-19! The msm will start focusing on the delayed elections and attack Trump.
So if Trump has been doing this since his first day in office.. why is ot still one of the largest problems we still have in America? Shouldnt it be solved or at least gotten better by now? ARE you suggesting #TrumpIsWeak

I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any evidence to support your claim that Trump wants to place black people below white people. There have been no actions or statements that support that. I was trying to go straight for WHY you would perceive things that way.
You don't check your sources. Here‚Äôs the full statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Federation of Teachers, the National Education Association and AASA, the School Superintendents Association.
Don't believe this guy; he's as anti trump as they come. "Science" is trash when the analysis is designed to come out a certain way.  #hydroxichloroquine
save the USPS. Trump will defund until there is no mail at all.
Trump said that he could shoot somebody and they'd still support him. Well he didn't need a gun in this case.
The color of evil is putrid Orange to think a president could actually delay the elections is ridiculous? Trump you have no power to delay the election! It won't happen! You might try to sue 36 or 37 States when you lose to Joe Biden but it won't work! #dumpTrump
That reasoning never crossed Trump‚Äôs mind.
Pogue is an anti-trump with 100s of anti-trump tweets, including disparaging tweets about Sarah Sanders.  Which means his "analysis" has ZERO credibility. He has a clear agenda.  #Hydroxychloroquine
Here‚Äôs Herman Cain at Trump‚Äôs Tulsa Campaign Rally where he likely contracted COVID. No mask. No social distancing.  Stupidly following Donald Trump in denial of the virus... #TrumpKillsAmerica

Watching his propaganda news briefing, Trump said that things in Florida is getting better. Yesterday some 264 died and today, we‚Äôll over 250 from COVID-19. How can he lie and the Fox crowd blelieves him. They are complecit in his crimes.
Trump is high and clueless as to what McConnell has not done. He sat on this bill since MAY

Sorry, that makes no sense whatsoever. People die in pandemics, and b I'm sorry fur your loss. However, while Obama acted decisively to fight against H1N1, Trump has done the exact opposite. He has countered and maligned the very people he should have been listening to along.

Bottom line: the N.R.A. laundered Russian money into the 2016 campaign and illegally coordinated with the Trump campaign. The N.R.A. needs to have its tax-exempt status stripped. Our documentary details all of this. But we need help to get the doc out.
Trump doesn‚Äôt care if more of his voters vote by mail. Trump doesn‚Äôt care if vote by mail is popular. The best opportunity Republicans have to suppress the vote is by reducing the number of urban voting sites where voters can vote. That‚Äôs the plan!

So, so sad. Herman Cain contracted COVID-19 at Trump‚Äôs rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma where social distancing signs were removed by Trump campaign staffers and masks were not required. I hope you‚Äôre proud of yourself, Mr. President. Cain‚Äôs death was a result of YOUR negligence.
Republicans against Trump
Republican Voters against Trump. I believe she‚Äôs in Ohio.
History will remember Donald Trump in one way and one way only: as an accessory to the murder of tens of thousands of Americans. And amazing legacy
I don't think so loll trump is done
I would call it more of a Nazi rally. You were still able to work with Nazi's even if you're on the wrong side. A lot of Trump's tactics are Nazi-like especially the past 2-3 months. Klan is just more of entitled and very narrow-minded White people.. not a real movement.
Thanks! I must assume, then, that you recognized the character played by Robert Duvall in that pic and the implied connection to my joke about Eric Trump, n'est ce pas? Hope you chuckled to yourself! üòé
I sense desperation in the air....your years as an enabler to Donald Trump are costing you.
Yes. And that is why so many deaths are on Trump. If he had modeled and emphasized mask wearing and discouraged the push to reopen so fast fewer people would have died.
Imagine if the Republicans did that for the first two years of Trump, Now maybe you might want to reconsider that change? Harry Reed did it for all judges other than Supreme Court. Republicans than included the Supreme Court. How did that work out for you?
Very apparent, Trump will never be called eulogize anyone....besides, will they let him out of prison to do it.
I mean he died from the virus... who cares if it's from the rally or not... honestly it's his fault as much as its Trump's fault.. you have to be a fucking idiot to go to a rally where you know most aren't smart enough to wear masks.
Think about this one. I have seen every past president be able to cite Bible verses like Obama did in today‚Äôs eulogy. But never once from Trump. What a fraud.
Your right it‚Äôs just disappointing to have Trump as our President
Trump's little crony. Did nothing to help him.
Obama‚Äôs eulogy was very inspiring. I miss a President who can deliver an inspirational message that is positive and filled with unity and hope. We lost something precious when we got saddled with Trump.
Thank you! He praised Trump 4 not making masks mandatory for the July 4th rally. He said (in caps): "people are fed up". He was a selfish pig. I save my sadness 4 the innocent pple who died because of them. The chickens have come home to roost! Ana is not rude just factual!

I want all trump administration gone ASAP and GOP. They are all scum. The ride has been very bad. Killing Americans should have been stopped. We stopped being USA. A lot of people need to lose their jobs in the next administration. FBI and CIA and generals. All at the top.

Biden did not say that Trump will achieve it, Biden said that he would try. In in fact, thats what Trump said he wants to do. So you  were/are wrong.
If he got help from his gubernatorial allies... we'd end up with a situation where only Blue states vote.  That would not be the outcome Trump wants. It's possible Biden could get to 270 without the deep Red states voting. Trump digs chaos, but not chaos where he loses big.
Or goes to jail... Cain was a big boy. He, along w/ Trump &amp; the rest of the goons, have caused many innocent people to die. He praised Trump 4 not making masks mandatory for the July 4th rally &amp; said that "people are fed up" (in caps). They deleted it today.

Completely agree. But theres that filibuster rule, etc, plus each member of the senate would have to give a little speach abt why Trump is evil, etc.   Maybe they could do it faster. Obvi, it would be priority #1. Trump would be on lockdown!!  Lol

No joke, Trump is getting off on this - the moment he realized he could tweet praise for a different black guy who just died on the same day he planned on blowing off respect for John Lewis, I‚Äôm sure a big smug grin crossed his face and he dove for his phone.

Today Trump suggested delaying the election. Obama was reinforcing John Lewis' belief "When you see something that is not right, you must do something," "Democracy is not a state. It is an act, and each generation must do its part."
And Trump voters are conservative, so what does that make him? Your claim was specious and an attempt to discredit the original point, which is that by and large Republicans and far right groups are the biggest pushers re: reopening/masks are ineffective/covid conspiracies.

Donald Trump.
Right, because when Lewis boycotted BOTH Bush's and Trump's inaugurationa he was working to bring people together?
You have to keep in mind that Trump's biggest supporters are Nazis &amp; white supremacists.  These people love his racism.  He's one of them.  Has anyone ever checked his closet for his white hood &amp; robe?
No it‚Äôs in the constitution that both houses must approve it first.  The spanish flu was worse more deaths it didn‚Äôt get postponed. Trump definitely cannot do it.

Yea and I‚Äôm sure the 8 Trump campaign staffers who contracted COVID shortly after the Tulsa Rally must‚Äôve gotten it from somewhere else too. Regardless I guarantee that he and those around him did not wear masks or take the virus seriously which still makes it ironic and foolish
No one there wanted trump to say a damn thing.

Trump finally said something today that I agree with. He said the virus should have been stopped. Absolutely right. It should have been but you were too busy calling it a hoax and saying it would magically go away. Trump is to blame. He had a chance to control it and failed

There is a brutal war against the American people by dictator Trump. Do something about that!
Isn‚Äôt it shitty that  and the  have to try to make America be horrible, in order to get elected, instead of running off of their policies? They need covid to stick around to run from the debates. They think more people hate Trump than in 16 #SilentMajority
Fun fact: if you still think that having Trump in for a second term to spite the DNC is justified because of what happened with bernie. You're classist, racist, queerphobic and beyond privileged and your voice is meaningless to me
Reminder that trump is a racist and a fascist and if we don't get him out his congressional stooges will overturn democracy and destroy civilization as we know it
FINALLY, Trump says something I can agree with.
Donald Trump: Feds Not Leaving Portland Until Democrats Secure the City
Boy, does this have the ring of truth to it after almost 4 years of watching Trump grift his way through the Presidency.

Trump made it way worse by saying it was nothing and it would just go away and don't wear masks and take the non proven malaria meds, but ok point the finger somewhere else just like he does.
fair points, although I think his age is a bit overblown in this context, my question again - would you rather a Harris POTUS or a Trump POTUS?

These ass clowns will do anything to get Trump re-elected to avoid what consequences are to come their way should they lose and that‚Äôs terrifying TBH.
But anyone who knows Trump‚Äôs history in real estate already knows the goals of his racist housing practices.
Trump's language has always seemed so awkward and disjointed to me.
Bc that‚Äôs what his base wants him to do jim it‚Äôs no secret that far right wing males hates Troops in Germany and Korea . Also .. same thing about masks . It‚Äôs not what trump believes it‚Äôs what his supporters believe ...and he Does not  want to rock the boat ‚õµÔ∏è
I‚Äôm thinking Trump doesn‚Äôt need the money
You do that. I have been a Trump supporter since he announced he was running over 4 years ago.
Trump never changes. Reminder that he was sued in 1973 for alleged racial discrimination at Trump housing developments in New York.
No, the protests only took off after Trump's illegal federal troops tried to suppress the people's right to protest and assemble. #TrumpIsALoser
Trump Wins!
I'm not sure anybody could have predicted this pandemic with an absolute #FloridaMan Governor leading the way on top of the gators, sharks, invasive species, Trump moving to Florida, and the usual hijinks of a Carl Hiaasen novel come to life.   Florida on steroids, me thinks. üò≥

Fox News Poll: Biden holds lead over Trump as coronavirus concerns grip nation  #FoxNews
Trump's shortcomings make weak opponent Biden look strong - BBC News  Article states obvious.
Does anybody remember the old days when a GOP dog whistle was actually a dog whistle and not a bloody air horn? Trump and his minions have been screaming the quiet parts for years.
Trump will win.
I prefer to believe that Trump doesn‚Äôt choose to solve the Coronavirus because less voters at the polls on November 03/20 means better chances for a Republican victory. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
Trump and his Administration bought up the world supply of Hydroxylchloraquine a couple of months ago. Those pills aren‚Äôt going to sell themselves!
Well.  thank God Trump has a warehouse full of hydroxychloroquine...all for you and the people you infected.  Step right up!
This is right in line with your racism and the way you and your racist father built your racist business. If anyone has not read about or seen documentaries about the Trump family needs to. It‚Äôs in his DNA and that will never change!
Trump is hiding the fact that Herman Cain is on a ventilator.for 5 weeks now.  Thanks to his Tulsa rally... Only hoax was that rally..who‚Äôs going to the next rally...back to North Carolina...again...
It's in context with the the thread. Pace yourself, Trump's next four years in office are going to be hard on you.

Damn, why didn't they test him after..so trump could have caught it.
the desperation of the trump ass kissers is ... exploding. people are saying. and, FU!
FACT: Trump never had the majority, silent or otherwise.  The win resulted from political strategy that leveraging the electoral college.  I doubt DNC will fall for it a second time.  They will focus on battleground States and continue to let Donald shoot himself in the foot.
Now we know what the last Putin-trump phone call was all about

Barr and Trump!  What a team.
Most awkward coming from Trump.
Never use the term "very sophisticated way" in a description of Trump, especially when he's idolizing a doctor who claims demon sperm causes medical problems. I'll never get over that this is what we've been reduced to, a POTUS, who is likely totally out of his mind. And corrupt.He is not your president whether like it or not. Donald Trump is. I had to put up with this bozo for eight years, but I always thought of him as our president.
And Trump will step over his body and keep going. He sacrificed his life for naught never to have his name uttered again by the chosen one. Black people are dying 3 times more than whites. How senseless to die being so utterly reckless.
I agree RIP ... üôè HERMAN CAIN. strength peace  and prayers to your family.  I also believe POTUS TRUMP should reach out to Dr. BEN CARSON and have him continue the lead of C19 , he's also an excellent investment to our party of good peopole. üôè‚ô•Ô∏èüá∫üá∏

This is what happens when Trump is upstaged by a dead black man, and the black POTUS that is eulogizing him.   Trump to WH staff: "Cancel everything that I wasn't going to attend anyway, so that I might attempt to divert the attention that no one is paying me!"

Not so fast, Donald.
More  trump  lies .  He's  had over  3 1/2 years  and trumps major  accomplishments  are  1) holding  a  lot  of  hate rallies   2) cheating  at golf  costing USA  taxpayers  $150 million  3) being responsible  for  150,000 deaths  and counting  in the USA .

I appreciate you being the toughest questioner in the WH Press corps, but this opening sentence plays right into the narrative that it‚Äôs the Dems fault. The failure lies with Trump &amp; Mnuchin‚Äôs inability to negotiate a package that provides actual assistance to those who need it.

trump is okay with Putin paying terrorists to kill American military personnel. He is a traitor.
trump is a traitor and Putins puppet.
$5 says he loses in a landslide. Too many voters now see that everything he does is driven by outdated views on what made America so great.  Trump divides people, lies and exacerbates problems. He is not working to solve anything.
If there was any doubt that trump is insane, that doubt has now been removed.

Trump is the Typhoid Mary of Covid. Herman Cain attended Oklahoma Trump shindig and has been hospitalized with Covid19 ever since.  Trump never mentions Cain. Trump can‚Äôt even wish him well.
Tell me when we have effective vaccines AFTER Biden is in office, and how many obstructionist GOP members are ousted along with Trump. Then I‚Äôll give you my answer.
Trump‚Äôs strategy is to gin up fear. He does this by tearing America apart. Putin could not have pick a better foil.
Trump wins every time his supporters infiltrate peaceful protests to destroy property.  State law enforcement and   simply need to ID persons attending protests NOT to actually support BLM, but send message across nation the #BLM is a danger.  ID and report it out.

When a toddler done get his way.  They will say anything until they get there way.  We should  all vote by mail.  It's safe and easier for everyone.   I forgot Russia and hack into mail in voting.  Wondering if thats why Trump want to stop it.
If Trump had mandated masks at his Tulsa rally, Herman Cain would still be alive.
If you‚Äôve had enough of Donald Trump‚Äôs chaos and corruption, here‚Äôs one way you can help end it.  Chip in ANY AMOUNT to attend the virtual grassroots fundraiser with  and  tomorrow and let‚Äôs sweep Donald Trump into the dustbin of history.
So self respecting woman votes for Trump.  Every mom I know is sick and tired of the dangerous and divisive DJT bullshit train and will be voting straight blue this year.    ...and I'll be looking forward to seeing #denialdonald removed forcefully on  inauguration day.
Heels up Harris. Fraud liar and cheat. Vote for Trump and Straight Republican in 2020.
What happened to Herman Cain was predicted.  Trump knew it would happen to a percentage of attendees.  That‚Äôs why he made them sign a liability waiver.  He was ok with it as long as he got to have his rally.  I can‚Äôt understand why both sides aren‚Äôt outraged.
Imbecil, that's why Trump did prison reform, because police, including elite FBI, bully people into taking a plea. They do it to minorities too often or any one who is their enemy. These agencies have too much power.
Sounds like Trump is trying to cheat by electronic voting and vote by mail blocks that.
It‚Äôs fairly clear that he chose to vilify the science behind mask use to please Trump. He put his faith in a charlatan rather than the true experts. That loyalty ultimately cost him his life.
Trump led Herman Cain to the gates of Hell.

Hey Robbie. Have you read Mary Trump‚Äôs book?  Lots and lots of early tells.
The color of evil is putrid Orange to think a president could actually delay the elections is ridiculous? Trump you have no power to delay the election! It won't happen! You might try to sue 36 or 37 States when you lose to Joe Biden but it won't work! #dumpTrump
That reasoning never crossed Trump‚Äôs mind.

Trump again throwing meat to the media about this "delay the election" talk..what he tryna distract us from?
The Donald Trump Presidency.
Juan Williams saying Trump is a sore loser is amazing considering he‚Äôs 1-0 in elections so literally he has never lost.
Yesterday trump was trying to scare people from black and brown people who could possibly move into their neighborhoods and lower their house prices, today he wanted to postpone the election and this is your message?
Greatings brothers, would it be too much to ask for a min of you time or a reshare ?
In totally agree. Would it be too much to ask a ally for a minute to assist our a black radio show host?
What more does McConnell want out of trump, he could make trump resign tomorrow and run with pence and haley, but this is the party of trump...they are all trump now.

Lewis showed nothing but contempt for President Trump, why should he bother?
Think about this one. I have seen every past president be able to cite Bible verses like Obama did in today‚Äôs eulogy. But never once from Trump. What a fraud.
Obama‚Äôs eulogy was very inspiring. I miss a President who can deliver an inspirational message that is positive and filled with unity and hope. We lost something precious when we got saddled with Trump.
I want all trump administration gone ASAP and GOP. They are all scum. The ride has been very bad. Killing Americans should have been stopped. We stopped being USA. A lot of people need to lose their jobs in the next administration. FBI and CIA and generals. All at the top.
doesn't care, he's a loyalist.  But he better be careful, those close to Trump are testing positive and now sadly dying. I do not know if DeSantis has any health issues other than being overweight. Maybe his  family can be of influence for his sake if not for ours
Judging by my Twitter timeline, I think I may be the only one who is quite pleased that Trump didn‚Äôt go to John Lewis‚Äô funeral.
And Trump has the audacity to offer condolences to Mr. Cain's grieving family without taking responsibility for hosting a senseless rally during a global pandemic.
And nobody knew it until ‚ÄúProfessor‚Äù Trump told us.
And trump doesn't care because he has no soul!

Are you also wondering how many regular, ordinary, non-public figures also died as a result of the ill-advised Trump Tulsa rally that killed Herman Cain?  There are certainly others.

Trump has mishandled crises, 150,000 of our fellow Americans are dead, we continue to grapple with systematic racism &amp; we have a careless BIGOT who could not care less if things got worse because he‚Äôs making them worse. Let us listen to Obama and VOTE!!!! VOTE EVERY ENABLER OUT!
Given the way he's running his campaign, you have to wonder:  What does the President have on Donald J. Trump?
Trump and Barr are unconstitutional thugs running Stormtroopers in cities, yet many want a national mask mandate and Federal law enforcement out there arresting people not wearing. Bet if a guy got gassed,  beat and dragged off by cops for no mask they would cheer it
What I would expect on  tonight. Top story will be a live report from the NY pizza restaurant that trump tweeted out. In the 57th minute, there will be a snippet of video of Obama, Bush and Clinton speaking at John Lewis service
Even if delayed, Trump still leaves office at noon on January 20th, 2021. Absolutely nothing changes that.
Trump could never give a speech/eulogy because he can't talk about anyone but himself.  I love and miss Obama so much!!
No one there wanted trump to say a damn thing.

The Trump Family is known for their NDA‚Äôs and that should not count
Trump's hunger to lie more is never satiated.
Maduro is asking me to tell you if you can build something that float like a raft with a sail so you can sail from the us to Venezuela...you could refuel in cuba and keep sailing down here. Bu hurry up b4 Trump the dictator put you in jail
Trump 2020!
Trump is so jealous b/c he knows he will never be  As respected as they are. Not even close.
Your state is losing 100‚Äôs if people a day and you are doing nothing but ignoring it.  We all see you.  You are world famous #DeathSantis and there is a sod isl place waiting for you in hell, right next to Trump #GOPGenocide

Thought trump was god
This is the masterful act of speaking from both sides of trump‚Äôs mouth no matter how contradictory it may be so long as his pushing his own interest at others expense! Vintage trump!
I must say Trump managed to change the subject from the serious unemployment situation and the worst GDP in history.
The plan for autocracy is set in motion...

I agree RIP ... üôè HERMAN CAIN. strength peace  and prayers to your family.  I also believe POTUS TRUMP should reach out to Dr. BEN CARSON and have him continue the lead of C19 , he's also an excellent investment to our party of good peopole. üôè‚ô•Ô∏èüá∫üá∏

Trump is not a hipocrat,  remember how Mr.lewis behave during the inauguration, never recognized his victory,  and boycott the event. ....plus the impeachment, hard to forget too.
All after trump‚Äôs executive order authorizing #NoVisaRequiredTravel to and from Poland!!! üáµüá±   Now, we have FACELESS THUGS, THAT DO NOT SPEAK AND CANNOT BE IDENTIFIED, ROAMING OUR STREETS.   Gee, I wonder why?
#BLMprotest ran up to the last election and then immediately disappeared after #Trump was elected. Now that he is up for re-election we have protests again that will also immediately end once the election is over. Can you all see the puppets hand in the sock? I can. #blm.
Biden was giving a hypothetical, knowing Trump will do whatever he can to ‚Äúfix‚Äù the election. Trump, if he could, would actually do it!!
With out Trump this country will be another Venezuela
Let's track the Trump $$ some more. $600K seems small beans compared to what we can find on
He‚Äôd use the loss of his family to manipulate potential donors into contributing to Trump. #DeSantisResignNow
And BTW Kim, did you ever get the money Parscale owed you for promoting Trump, because it‚Äôs not like you do this because you truly want him to win, right Kim?  The only way you‚Äôll promote him is if he pays you to promote him.
Not Biden, his handlers will refuse to debate Trump. They have been looking for a way out. That's why they keep him in the baseman.
People, the owners of  are not Americans, they came from Australia 25 years ago to fuck us up, and spread colonial racism in our country, not to mention lies and Pandemic misinformation, without them, no Trump presidency, and no 150,000 people dead #DyingForTrump
--&gt; Horrible numbers came out today --&gt; John Lewis was eulogized by 3 presidents. --&gt; Obama killed it. Trump didn't go. Sent nobody.  --&gt; Herman Cain died prob because he attended Trump's Tulsa Rally. --&gt; Repubs have no $ plan.  ... &amp; trump diverts by trying to postpone election.
Trump isn't the one who's setting crime records in Chicago, and he's not the one causing the civil unrest. That was your MAYOR! Might want to ask her why she hates our country.
I think it's much more likely that Trump is not actually engaged in the struggle that the Qanon people think he is.  Powerful pedophiles exist, in almost every major institution worldwide, but Trump isn't fighting them.
Divino! üëå Trump read my thoughts
Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That‚Äôs Unconstitutional.  #unconstitutional
Isn‚Äôt it sad that Trump had NICER things to say about Herman Cain than he did John Lewis?
Trump inauguration walkout song.
When Trump wins re-election with mail in ballots, will the opposition question the integrity of the election? Anyone who says no is either ignorant or intellectually dishonest.
Funny how tRump learned so much about the minutiae of the entire nation‚Äôs voting systems just by trailing in the polls.
U tell me nothing i don't know but seem unaware that  Dems are less uninformed re early treatment. Science requires open-minds. Accepting all Fauci sez on faith, &amp; accepting prevention of RX's &amp; censorship is authoritarianism. It kills people &amp; pushes independents toward Trump.

Almost $3T in Trump's 4 years.
1,529 people died today in the United States due to COVID-19 and we had 70k new cases.  That‚Äôs the highest number of deaths recorded since May 14th.  Trump‚Äôs incompetence is killing thousands of people.
Russians really don't like Putin. They follow him hoping for scraps. And they hate Trump. They think he's a fucking clown like we do And having Trump around would only intensify that.   No Russia is a trailer park with nuclear weapons.
Lol? I criticize Trump on the daily. Shut the hell up. It has nothing to do with gender.
He passed away from the Trump Virus. After the first 5K deaths Trumps owns the virus and every victim's thereafter, including Herman Cain passing.

Don‚Äôt trust them. Don‚Äôt ever. But if they collectively abandon Trump it‚Äôs lights out at Trump campaign HQ. Like there‚Äôs no money and no point to continue.
Trump talked about the re-infestation in foreign countries vs. how good we are doing in the US. You know the next step is his claims a total lockdown would have been useless.
We all expected Trump to threaten to delay the election, right? This shouldn‚Äôt come as a surprise, but it should continue to motivate us to act.
why has Trump not been given a psychological evaluation?
Not only that but all the media outlets inferred he contracted the virus after attending a Trump rally with no evidence.
Trump doesn‚Äôt joke, even when he‚Äôs making fun of people. Have you ever even seen him laugh?
According to MSM Trump reneged on delaying the Election! All of America is on his ass!
No shjt. You Republicans still don‚Äôt get Trump do you.   He did it so democrats would say people can get out and vote
And dems so shocked that Trump is concerned.   Amazing.   4 LA men admit to Skid Row voter-fraud scheme, DA announces
Oh, they will be. Then you'll find just how much of a shell game the Trump empire really was. I'm betting he actually worth from 5 to 10% of what he says. Everything else is leveraged up the heinie.
Best mask ever! #trump #mask #virus #coronavirus

Herman Cain did not believe in wearing a mask, Trump did believe in wearing a mask.  Wearing a mask protects you from getting the virus, not completely but it help's tremendously.  He died because of the virus and supporting Trump's belief's #TrumpKillsAmericans
I‚Äôd vote for Mickey Mouse before I vote for Trump.
If this would of been Trump the left and democrats would of called him disgraceful and opportunistic to use Lewis‚Äôs funeral for political agenda. Real sad
#ObamaWasBetterAtEverything Obama had some smooth BS . Likeable on the surface which Trump really isn‚Äôt good at . Policy wise. No comparison
Madness. How convenient.. there‚Äôs a new post master that was hired by the trump administration..
His "Secret Service" isn't going to get near him with the actual USSS puting up a fight. And Park Police (uniformed USSS agents). And the US Marshals. And DC Police. And that's all before the military get to the scene.  Trump ain't got the stones to put up a fight.
Ted Suhl, a manager at Southeastern Asset Management, the largest shareholder of KODK with 55.3% ownership position had his bribery prison sentence commuted by Trump last year. This week Kodak  up 2,189% after  Trump backs pivot into drug industry.
You know Obama is a criminal, and the entire left has been filling people minds with lies about Trump. You're just a sad case of TDS! You also know John Lewis was a racist himself, and he did NOTHING for his city. Period but make himself rich.
To who? Putin isn't that vain. He's not going to keep Trump around as a prize.
Yes i do but I'm just saying, having biden would be the worse choive to have as president. No police, segregation may make a comeback, far more blacks in jail. You can say what you want about trump but before covid or in this the chinese virus, he was doing great
Trump supporters assume they are the ‚Äúsmart people‚Äù in this instance.  They are not. Not now. Not ever.
Republicans flat-out reject Trump‚Äôs suggestion to delay election  via
If he did, then why wouldn't he say so? Trump seems to say everything that's on his mind.
Yea i feel you Trump is a racist apologist at best. But he can think all he wants. Our checks and balances are too solid. Cuba was easy pickings with so many living in dier circumstances. I miss BO...I'm getting nostalgic lol
That's it in a nutshell. Putin has no loyalty to him. He drop Trump like an 80# bag of cement. And then call in all of his loans. Mar-A-Lago might be on the market sometime next year.
trump visit KODK fact. KODK secured loan to produce pharmaceuticals(hydroclorowhatever). stock then quadruples. Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt see these drugs are just money in they pockets.
I am not sure if I should believe what you're saying. Say that now and say something else in the end is not the same. You called Trump a conman.and now you're bossom buddies..thanks but no thanks.
Dear white supremacist Nazi, the  is coming for you in 2021, you are only out of jail because of Trump, when he's gone, so will you.

Don't be foolish, Trump 2020- 2024 you are super blind.
I caught Obama talking as I walked by the TV today and I wondered what political event he was speaking at. Then I realized it was a funeral. And they say Trump is classless.
Trump will deport them in due time. When you enable Nazis they always wind up turning on you eventually.
No, there‚Äôs no praising them. But it might be a signal to all the conservative judges that they aren‚Äôt obligated to support Trump.
My man. I'm no Trump supporter. Didn't vote for him and I dont plan to. But you think he is the only one talking about the validity of our democracy? Both sides attack it as it suites them. Remember how Russia got Trump elected? Trump cant be Castro because America can't be Cuba.
And Trump says he's the best president since Lincoln! He's the worst ever!
If you believe in Karma, then Trump is in a lot of trouble.
Yeah but Trump is not popular (due to his own putrid actions) surely that is more meaningful than either of those things
I agree, I do not vote by mail, only in person and for the record, I vote for Donald Trump, that will not change, a letter came to my house to vote by mail without my name on the outside or inside, with envelope  with paid mail and so I sent it
Fuck Covid and fuck Donald Trump.
Obama had people entering illegally in cages. Trump terminated that practice. My family came to the US legally even though it cost my grandfather 3 years working at a labor camp in Cuba basically a slave in order to do so. You just have no idea how bad it is in other places
BASKETBALL IS BACK  Also Donald Trump is a White Supremicist, full stop!
Everytime someone says Trump was joking without fail they are proven wrong within 24 hours.

What reason would u have for voting for Trump unless you are racist?  Voting republican? They are destroying us.

That *does not* mean mass ballots automatically sent to every voter. ‚ÄúUniversal‚Äù simply means it would be an OPTION for every citizen in every state, with or without needing to list a reason. Trump would still need to differentiate if that is EXPLICITLY what he‚Äôs talking about.
I‚Äôm not comparing them in how they got into power. I‚Äôm comparing them by the way they present themselves. They both have authoritarian thoughts and motives. Hence, Trump‚Äôs tweet today:

#Civilization5 : I just had what I call a "Trump Moment"... I pressed the "launch" button while looking at a specific place in the map, not realizing the nuke was pointed somewhere else nearby... now I'm in an unintended war with an opponent much better prepared to kick my ass.
I will always hate him for his ‚Äúit‚Äôs time to come together‚Äù post Trump win victory speech.   Like, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre pay attention. Are you?‚Äù
Kids don‚Äôt have serious cases look it up, what trump doesn‚Äôt want is mail in voting because it‚Äôs so easy to cheat that way, someone‚Äôs dead cat got a voter registration card in the mail, I dont click on your videos anymore because of how soyboy you‚Äôve become Hila is cool tho
One of these weeks we'll wake up to a Black Mirror reality of Trump fucking a pig on television. Then he'll do something worse by Tuesday.
Guess we‚Äôre getting a potential category 1 Hurricane this weekend. So it‚Äôs pretty much a Trump. A bit of wind and rain but will do pretty much nothing.
When you're a Republican and have lost the Federalist Society....
Trump can't get it through his thick skull that mail in voting benefits both parties equally. On top of that, don't he realize people in the military also vote by mail.
Trump Meets with Family of Slain Soldier, Offers To Pay for Funeral

It‚Äôs inherently racist because we live in a system that guarantees that IF a memeber of the minority group DOES accend to heights, it‚Äôs predicated on that individual demonstratively NOT being an Ally to his/her minority group.
So now we're back for circle and you understand my first take. He doesn't have to do anything at all to appeal to any of us and he can just hide. Like I said he's literally failing upwards just because Trump is so awful not because he's offering us anything to vote *for.*

Oh, so you‚Äôre the Trump whisperer?  ok lol
That not new! But today his true colors came out 4all to see. His presidency was d groundwork for much of what‚Äôs happening today. He thought it would continue when HRC became President never expected Trump to win but certainly took measures just in case. Disgrace is too nice

I said on policy. Remember he's a status quo, corporatist, neoliberal, right-of-center politician that refuses to offer even one major concession on policy for the left who is offering old Obama era policies. You know, the neolib trash that got us a Trump in the 1st place.

If you want youth and Black voters to turn out, they have to LOVE the candidate.  No one loves Biden.  Hillary lost in 2016 in part because the Obama coalition on Black voters didn't show up.  Black voters don't hate Trump.  He is more popular now than he was in 2016.
Trump is talking about Americans here. Referring to protesters as a beehive of terrorists to be ‚Äúcleaned out.‚Äù Horrifying fascist language here.

The Federalist Society, the people who gave Trump a list of the most radical right-wing judges on the planet. Yeah, you guys have a lot of credibility, doing harm to the country, that is.
He's literally failing upwards just bc Trump is so awful. Most people voting Joe are doing so *against* Trump, not *for* Joe or any policy. He's flavorless tofu. This is peak hostage situation. He's literally our only option and only marginally less damaging than Trump on policy.
Donald Trump messed things up so bad that people with U.S. passports literally can‚Äôt travel almost anywhere in the world.

I'll explain what is happening here.  No one gives a damn about Biden. No one likes Biden. No one is excited about Biden. 2/3 of the Biden vote in a recent poll were voting AGAINST Trump, not FOR Biden. 90% of Trump voters were voting FOR Trump.  If that hold, Biden loses YUGE.
He died a Trump-Ass-Kissin‚Äô fool! He undoubtedly has also infected many others! God spared him from cancer &amp; he turns around &amp; praises tRump! Cain‚Äôs very public defiance of experts &amp; his very public praise of Trump, led to his very swift &amp; unnecessary death! #TrumpIsAnIdiot

Trump's taken one question and has gone all over the place for almost 10 mins now. He couldn't pass a sobriety test.
Wallace apologized, begged for forgiveness in one of the grandest Churches in Alabama in the late 70s.  Being forthright, honest in his transgressions,and humble, he received over 90% of the African-American vote while running for governor in 1982.  Trump can‚Äôt duplicate that.
Yeah thats not the trump test. Weve been asking for rapid testing for month and he didnt do it. IN FACT he keeps taking money away from testing. 151,000 dead and counting. A competent president would have prevented most of that and used DPA for rapid tests months ago.

Trump's campaign is ... actively adding Republicans to the list
Trump is setting up to nullify the November 3 Election. He‚Äôs saying it might take months and years before we find out who won. Folks, we need to hit the streets as soon as possible.
Trump says it‚Äôs totally safe to send our kids back to school.  Trump also says we should delay the election until it‚Äôs safe.  They say Trump supporters are either billionaires, or easily manipulated idiots. Check your bank account to see which one you are.

Maybe he shouldn‚Äôt have defended trump for so long. What did he think would happen.  Screw his guilt

Trump is Fully Shit he have No Authority to do that
That would be a lie. Trump IS a full blown racist.
And many more, &amp; we know what Pizza means to Hollywood &amp; Politicians etc. And Trump Tweets "St James Pizza" etc.  TOTAL HINT &amp; CALLING THEM OUT
Searing, but wrong. You can be a buffoonish heckler, and still be a brutal strongman. Trump absolutely could be both. He's not quite the latter, but that's more because he‚Äîthank God‚Äîlacks that final gene or chromosome allowing him to issue the "kill order." But he's gotten close.
This is active sabotage against the post office for the purpose of undermining vote by mail and the November election. It‚Äôs a delibate strategy of voter suppression perpetrated by Trump and his cronies.
This guy‚Äôs commentary on American politics is worthless. I also recall him saying Trump is going to jail.
President Trump asked for the November elections to be delayed.  So what?  Get over it.
I was just thinking of the same thing today. Trump has made us look like what he calls a s-hole country.
What‚Äôs shocking is just the utter disrespect. I mean, Trump flat out told reporters ‚Äúno‚Äù he wouldn‚Äôt be going to pay respects to John Lewis.
Trump has shown that he will do anything to take away the rights of the 8K #Dreamers in #FL26, keeping their lives in limbo as he scrambles to find ways to destroy DACA.  He must process DACA renewals &amp; new DACA applications now. Dreamers are Americans &amp; we will fight for them.
I mean quite frankly, as much as I despise Trump, Herman Cain was a full grown man in complete use of his capabilities. He had choices. He chose to attend and to not wear a mask so Herman Cain killed Herman Cain.
Republicans, you had to have known that Trump would make a fool out of you. It's what he does best. Just take the L, and rethink what you're doing. Ask yourself if his constant humiliation of you is really worth it.
Trump Suggests Delaying The Election Causing Democrats To Freak Out, But Technically Trump COULD
God Bless President Obama.  What a tribute to John Lewis, and a little bitch slap to Trump.
Just like a Trump supporter, no class or education
Herman Cain died today of COVID19 going to a  rally? Voting by mail has been uses by Trump and several others from GOP. Are you willing to take responsibility for more deaths Dawn?
This statement makes you worse than Trump. Granted, he‚Äôs an incredible president so that‚Äôs an easy thing to be- you have No respect. No Truth. Please spare the US and the internet from this bs. RIP Herman Cain, a real leader who never would have written something this tasteless
You have all the reason, but I am going to vote at the ballot box, and my vote goes to you President Donald Trump. Let‚Äôs make America great again, and good bless America üá∫üá∏
Right, but that was only clear to you. Bc that‚Äôs how YOU personally  interpret Trump‚Äôs tweet. He has never clarified that, and Claudia never said anything abt mass ballots. Vote by mail (not on a mass scale) IS a thing. She is clarifying this bc Trump doesn‚Äôt, &amp; it‚Äôs important.
It helps them supposedly with their plea bargain deals they are making, but if they say anything against Trump or his team gets harmed in anyway, then their lethal sentence is issued on tribunals.

I just asked was he a hateful person, I looked up the word in the dictionary first but I wondered why John Lewis was viewed as hateful. So I asked about Trump to see how someone could say John was hateful but Trump wasn't. Its not that complicated.
Agreed. I‚Äôm just saying, she IS right. There isn‚Äôt a difference. Bc voting by mail &amp; MASS voting by mail are different things. She‚Äôs not wrong just bc you interpret Trump‚Äôs tweets in a way that he‚Äôs actually never clarified. He presents them as the same thing. (Not by accident.)
Absolutely not! #VoteNovember3 #Vote2020
Wondering where Cuban travel aficionado and Trump enabler,  , stands on delaying the elections and reducing Floridians‚Äô $600 per week PUA money that they paid for with their federal tax dollars.  He doesn‚Äôt want to speak up and offend his corporate donors.
Trump is on that list :) not Tom
I have no idea why you felt the need to stoop so low. Your running against a moderate scandalfree Democrat in Debbie Mucarsel Powell for Congress. In a district that trump lost   41 to 57%. Debbie is not like Joe Garcia who's ethical record was spotty. 2/
It is! Stage one was COVID19- China virus. Remember Chinese government officials net wit President Trump's administration and President Trump, before we even found out about Coronavurus.

When asked about Trump‚Äôs comments regarding delaying the November election, governor  pretended he had not heard about it and said he hoped that would not be necessary.  What an embarrassment of a governor we have in Florida. A total spineless coward.
Because he knows how fucking nuts tRump is....just won't admit it on camera
Go Mr President!!! These democRATS are determined to destroy our nation and they know you won't allow them to do so, that's why they hate you.  Vote RED in November across the board. Trump 2020!!!
We are about to learn a lot, and today Trump hinted about moving the election date, that could mean maybe will find out before the election
100%, and there‚Äôs a lot of things going on behind the scenes that we don‚Äôt know about, but if Trump did this the entire Trump team along with Trump would be in prison already

You real Donald Trump   your a killer! 100% your responsibility!
I'd rather die than give Bill Gates another dime!
One more time Trump tries to insert chaos into the political arena by saying that he could move the election day! He knows that he cannot do it, but since most of his followers are dumb people and they believe him! Moron!
Constitutionally correct. My caveat is Trump could care less what our Constitution requires. Who is going to enforce the Constitution?

Why is this newsworthy,  ? Do we have a shortage thanks to Trump/Kuschner/Pence playing ostrich and hoping the promised miracle is on its way? Why do you support them? #SimpleDerelictionOfDuty
I was just seeing if the person saying one person is hateful was also capable of determining if Trump was also hateful. Its called being bias, not being able to be impartial. How does me asking a question implies hatred? Even if I was fishing for a impartial opinion?
Moving the election; ignoring the election results; and mass police action are three possible "red lines" I never thought Trump would cross. We've surged over the last of these already, and Trump's floating trial balloons about the first two.
ALL TRUMP IS DOING IS LAYING THE GROUNDS TO  Delay the ballots because he KNOWS HE IS GOING TO LOSE AND IS GONNA SAY THAT THE RACE WAS A HOAX AND MAIL IN BALLOTS WAS RIGGED #TrumpThreatensAmerica

Sounds like you were unaware before trump took office at the actual things that have been happening in our country for many years

I‚Äôm less worried about Trump succeeding than him failing w/ violence.   Example: .5% of his base is enough to create massive, widespread violence whether or not it changes the result of the election. And they‚Äôd be doing it while Trump was still President &amp; in control of DHS.
that's the point. BLM is not a government sponsored event. Trump's rallies are. They are the government actively endangering citizens. That's the difference between BLM, gas station, or anywhere else someone can get the virus. And I ask, for what reason was it necessary to do it
Trump the man, and "Trump" the idea are only electable as a very American response to a black president. There's no mystery to solve.
President Trump to you ü§°
Thank you for waiting for an answer. If he went to a BLM protest and got it there, I am sure you will be saying the same thing I am saying about him getting it a Trump rally. Of course you can get it anywhere, the point is the government should not be promoting dangerous events

No, WE are the ones who need the coup at this point. One can only hope  has enough military support to oust trump
Just a reminder that Donald Trump's tweet about the election is another ploy  to take away attention from Russia putting bounties on U.S soldiers.  And removing 12,000 troops from Germany to benefit Russia.
False. My state (Florida) transitioned from absentee to vote by mail, &amp; you 100% have to request the ballot, just the same as before. The ONLY difference is whether the ballots are counted before or after live voting. So, yeah, Trump DOES NOT vote absentee. He votes by mail.
Trump is loosing terrain due to the mismanagement of the Pandemic. Accused China for his carelessness dealing with all situations with Americans and the races issues. He showed no respect for anyone or everything. We the Prople are tired of his clownish and ignorance.

You are wrong. The ONLY difference is that absentee votes are counted after live voting &amp; vote-by-mail is counted before. Also, fun fact, there is no absentee voting in FL. Only vote by mail. So Trump DOES NOT vote absentee.

THANK YOU!!! Omfg the ignorance abt this absolutely kills me. The ONLY difference is if ballots are counted before or after live voting.  Also, there is no absentee voting in the state of Florida anymore. It‚Äôs ONLY vote-by-mail. So, TRUMP does NOT vote absentee. He votes by mail.

Always in business' pocket. You're also silent while Trump caters to Putin's campaign against American soldiers.  When are you going to condemn the long standing Miami tradition of human trafficking from Cuba? You could be so much better but choose the safer low road.

Two of the 4 are in China.. You would rather blame Trump coward
Agreed. What really creases me is that Trump cares nothing abt Rx prices‚Äîhe's only doing this as what will assuredly be 1 of many last-ditch efforts 2 buy votes. He's a capitalist pig, as bad as they are+doesn't give a monkey's how much they overcharge. Despicable+transparent.
is the only waterhole for desperate Trump voters, they go there to be lied to because it makes them feel good, never mind it's all lies and misinformation, the poor bastards don't know any better
Due to the Trump‚Äôs late, slow, disastrous approach to the coronavirus pandemia, USA is a huge graveyard with more than 150000 deaths and he is still misleading people . Trump‚Äôs inflammatory comments aggravated the racial crisis due to police brutality! Trump is unfit! Vote blue!
Ask yourself this... how many Joe Biden flags or lawn signs have you seen in your neighborhood compared to Trump flags and lawn signs ?!?! That‚Äôs the real question!
I don‚Äôt think Trump spoke today!
Idiot, what do you expect when  is the only Trumpian cable station in the nation? Matter of fact, 63 million voted for Trump, so Fox is doing really bad when only 3 or 4 million of them even bother to watch.

Trump lives rent free in your head all day
Obama used the politics that Lewis lived for in his eulogy which is deeply appropriate and seems to be what Lewis would have done. If people see that waving the banner of voting rights as anti-trump‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ I think that might say more about the president than anything else.
I‚Äôm not seeing how the politics of openness, inclusivity, and enfranchisement are connected to Trump in any way, save for the fact that Trump is has taken measures against all of those things.
The real death rate is being hidden by the trump White House.

What a sentence by  ‚ÄúFar from a strongman, Mr. Trump has lately become a heckler in his own government...‚Äù
We need to vote every Republican out that has enabled Trump and made our country the laughing stock of the world.
Yeah, that‚Äôs not going to happen. Florida has already turned Blue and it‚Äôs looking like Texas will go Blue too. Nobody likes Trump. Nobody.
Sigh, a ‚ÄúTrump 2.0‚Äù president is gonna beat this guy in 2024
Trump hasn‚Äôt been successful in subverting the law. The problem is much of the constitution assumed that those in office would be ethical gentlemen. Trump is neither. Even Rubio said today there will be no postponing the election.
Sorry to bait you. The comment was to trick some Trump supporters with an absurd statement :)

Trumpian weather coming at 10:00 PM? Oh please,  cannot be trusted with a Hurricane, you might get a call from Trump telling you to say it's a hoax by Democrats, and you will comply, like you did with Coranavirus, a hoax you told Americans as they died by the thousands
W  very mediocre President, good human being. trump horrible president, horrendous human being.

They know nothing will come from their statement.  They are saying that now so that when trump is out they can say "we stated we disagreed with him".  CYA. Thats all it is.

Trump isn't the one who's setting crime records in Chicago, and he's not the one causing the civil unrest. That was your MAYOR! Might want to ask her why she hates our country.

U tell me nothing i don't know but seem unaware that  Dems are less uninformed re early treatment. Science requires open-minds. Accepting all Fauci sez on faith, &amp; accepting prevention of RX's &amp; censorship is authoritarianism. It kills people &amp; pushes independents toward Trump.

Don‚Äôt trust them. Don‚Äôt ever. But if they collectively abandon Trump it‚Äôs lights out at Trump campaign HQ. Like there‚Äôs no money and no point to continue.
Trump talked about the re-infestation in foreign countries vs. how good we are doing in the US. You know the next step is his claims a total lockdown would have been useless.
We all expected Trump to threaten to delay the election, right? This shouldn‚Äôt come as a surprise, but it should continue to motivate us to act.
why has Trump not been given a psychological evaluation?
Not only that but all the media outlets inferred he contracted the virus after attending a Trump rally with no evidence.
Trump doesn‚Äôt joke, even when he‚Äôs making fun of people. Have you ever even seen him laugh?
According to MSM Trump reneged on delaying the Election! All of America is on his ass!
No shjt. You Republicans still don‚Äôt get Trump do you.   He did it so democrats would say people can get out and vote
And dems so shocked that Trump is concerned.   Amazing.   4 LA men admit to Skid Row voter-fraud scheme, DA announces
Oh, they will be. Then you'll find just how much of a shell game the Trump empire really was. I'm betting he actually worth from 5 to 10% of what he says. Everything else is leveraged up the heinie.

You know Obama is a criminal, and the entire left has been filling people minds with lies about Trump. You're just a sad case of TDS! You also know John Lewis was a racist himself, and he did NOTHING for his city. Period but make himself rich.
To who? Putin isn't that vain. He's not going to keep Trump around as a prize.
Yes i do but I'm just saying, having biden would be the worse choive to have as president. No police, segregation may make a comeback, far more blacks in jail. You can say what you want about trump but before covid or in this the chinese virus, he was doing great

Yea i feel you Trump is a racist apologist at best. But he can think all he wants. Our checks and balances are too solid. Cuba was easy pickings with so many living in dier circumstances. I miss BO...I'm getting nostalgic lol
That's it in a nutshell. Putin has no loyalty to him. He drop Trump like an 80# bag of cement. And then call in all of his loans. Mar-A-Lago might be on the market sometime next year.

No, there‚Äôs no praising them. But it might be a signal to all the conservative judges that they aren‚Äôt obligated to support Trump.
My man. I'm no Trump supporter. Didn't vote for him and I dont plan to. But you think he is the only one talking about the validity of our democracy? Both sides attack it as it suites them. Remember how Russia got Trump elected? Trump cant be Castro because America can't be Cuba.
If you believe in Karma, then Trump is in a lot of trouble.
Yeah but Trump is not popular (due to his own putrid actions) surely that is more meaningful than either of those things
I agree, I do not vote by mail, only in person and for the record, I vote for Donald Trump, that will not change, a letter came to my house to vote by mail without my name on the outside or inside, with envelope  with paid mail and so I sent it

Then, all states should have early voting &amp; there shouldn't be voting suppression. In the mist of a global pandemic people shouldn't stand in line hours on end to vote. There's no arguing that President Trump is the President of the USA.

Donald Trump tried voting by mail in Florida, and when it was rejected because he doesn't live in Florida, he changed his address to that of Mar-A-Lago where members are contractually forbidden from using it as their permanent residence. The fraud is inside the White House.

Doesn't matter what you think of Trump but he has shed light on this shit.....no one trust the media or government... Very interesting to see ghe Nov elections
We almost long Portland guys, thanks to Trump we still have it. Give it up for the best president in all of history üëèüèΩ. Oh and we‚Äôre about to lose the whole U.S. to a pandemic, but don‚Äôt worry about that for now, Trump will handle it right?
Go Trump #Trump2020
Your Party has a KNACK of losing to the MOST PATHETIC opponents.  Two times against George W. Bush (the worst president ever).  Now likely a second time to Trump.
No. She actually LOST.  To Trump.
Basically Run ahead of Trump: John Cornyn Run behind Trump: Steve Daines About the same as Trump: John James
Credit where credit is due...  Trump has done 1 good thing. He got rid of the no insurance penalty with the ACA.
1) I am not voting for Trump; 2) You are likely going to lose to Trump; 3) the ACA was a bailout for Insurance Companies and kept health care DEPENDENT on Insurance.  There is no field, this is no game.  Biden is on the other side.
No I am not supporting Trump. How hard is that to understand. I support NEITHER Trump nor Biden.  Get it - neither.  Neither is promoting a progressive agenda.  Learn how we got into this mess in the first place (playing the two party game).
I'm not voting for Trump.  Or Biden.
Go Trump Twenty Twenty
If Biden wins pandemic ends  If trump wins they‚Äôll create another pandemic   Democrats have run out of options.
Not Donald Trump who refuses several times.
What a different world we see!   You‚Äôre an American right? And you WANT to see the President either fail or die? It‚Äôs amazing how TDS can affect your soul.   I would liken it to a racist from the 50‚Äôs who spit on the 4 negro students in Little Rock! You have PURE HATE for Trump!
Daddy Trump has to sign off on it, which he will, do our accounts will be stimulated by the end of the month ü§∏üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è hopefully sooner
Yup, Trump will be reelected!
LIAR! What is it with women and power? Why are you degrading your gender by applauding evil while despising what‚Äôs right?   I love how the Dems try to predict Trump‚Äôs next move. He‚Äôs ready to declare martial law! We are watching God harden the hearts of millions before our eyes!
Thank you for not forcing us to watch Trump as others do.
Trump reportedly told aides to get Yankees to let him throw first pitch - but they hadn't actually invited him
Kissing his ass. We know barr has #trump #thetraitors ear just by the way  name is brought up every few questions.  We know where trump gets it. No accountability
If #trump #thetraitor hadn't given billionaires a tax break  wouldn't need to raise families taxes. What a shit show gaslighting has become you don't scare us #AMERICANCITIZENS are stronger together!!!!!
Barr resembles #trump #thetraitor and the #greedy #gop,#corrupt resemble #trump .
is it really possible for #trump to get elected 3 terms?
I‚Äôm not against criticizing Trump, I‚Äôm against bending backwards to please the media and Dems (but I repeat myself)
Trump doesn‚Äôt do well cooped up
Haha, truly pathetic when a Trump supporter is afraid to admit he does in fact support the President. Your whole timeline is white supremacist rage and retweets of the OAN network. Later, fool
it‚Äôs the trump crop top for me!
Trump says he won‚Äôt go and pay respects to John Lewis at Capitol
jobs jobs jobs Eric. MASS Exodus from China will curb the coming recession. Only your father Donald Trump could make something like that happen and really separate himself from the socialist democratic party. The only thing I know of that will save our economy .
. callous #COVID19 response fails America. It has jobless benefits cuts from $600 to $200 per wk, no funds to keep firefighters, teachers, nurses &amp; cops on the job, &amp; lacks housing help, but includes new FBI building to help Trump‚Äôs DC Hotel.
I have no expectations of the #corrupt #criminal #greedy #traitor #BillBarr to answer questions truthfully anymore than if #trump #thetraitor was testifying.  For some reason #gop and this #administration are trying to make all this #corruption look like it's #Democrat based.
That's Gov DeSantis playing with numbers a la Trump
This is a serious issue that needs to be pushed and pushed until we get answers. I‚Äôm far from a trump fan, but this makes you wonder what to believe. I watched the entire conference.
Facebook will not remove Trump ad using Ukraine picture of protesters - Business Insider. The picture's photographer confirmed to Business Insider on Wednesday that the image is of pro-democracy protesters in Ukraine six years ago.
Conservative wonders if Trump won‚Äôt throw first pitch because he‚Äôs afraid of walking down the ramp or players kneeling   U scarred
The UN has become irrelevant!  A strong and powerful response to this criminal activity is desperately needed. The Feds have been very patient so far.   It is Trump‚Äôs duty as President to protect the people and their property from external and INTERNAL Criminal forces! ACT NOW!
I can all but guarantee  won‚Äôt be voting for Trump... that‚Äôs ok though!
Ignore all the polls. Trump has a good shot at keeping Florida. I live here
Please watch/share. tRUMP is trying to set the stage in able to the results.
Trump will never will this election fair and square!! He is a thief in chief!!
I hope and pray every Democrat knows that trump has put his crone in charge of the post office, so if you vote by mail chances are,, you lost your vote,, get off ur ass and go to the polls
I thought Trump aside this aide is going to be huge. It‚Äôs the same 1200 if passed.
That is good,I would bet Mr. Lewis wouldn‚Äôt want him to come, he is still a better man then trump will ever be
Really I‚Äôm just hoping that if Trump wins Michigan, his coattails would also help John James
Oh please... I‚Äôve never been a Trump reporter.  üòÜ How are the riots on the President? One has nothing to do with the other whatsoever.  The terrorists of Antifa/BLM started all of this violence and destruction. The division is caused by demented identity politics. Wake up...
Its not about Trump.  You can‚Äôt restore a democracy undemocratically.  Biden is a joke and an insult.  I would never vote for him.
BREAKING NEWS please #protesters use this guideline because trump is using anything he can to corrupt this needed protest to stamp out inequality in our #country #democrecy #Constitution
is compromised by #trump #thetraitor,   and #jaredkurshner I have no idea they are both unqualified.  So #trump #thetraitor doesn't want  to be running the worthless #COVID19 task force.
Trump won‚Äôt even visit John Lewis #JohnLewis
Look... if you want to see who Trump cares about, just see the way he treats those close around him. It really doesn‚Äôt take a Einstein.
if Trump says liberals and #WallofMoms hate our country, then he must be a liberal since he supports #PutinsBounties against our American troops. #ResistanceTaskForce
What narratives is Trump pushing that you obviously find so offensive?
Looking like trump and  Kanye West üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇüòÇ
The same people complaining about what Trump is doing to this beautiful country are literally the ones ‚Äúpeacefully‚Äùdestroying everything in this country.  Brilliant. Fucking brilliant. I was never a Trump supporter until this rioting and terrorism started.
‚Å¶ Trump why don‚Äôt you go hide out in the bunker because that‚Äôs where your residential picture it will be posted. Shame on you. You‚Äôve just showed üá∫üá∏ how much of a true racist that you are. Jealous Of John Lewis‚Äôs legacy , just like Pres Obama
Hey Donald you weren‚Äôt invited! ‚Å¶‚Å¶ shame on you Trump! #WeWillMakeSureToVoteYouOutThisNovember
yeh the news doesn't really put numbers in perspective and discard the false the data-- And oh-- the other red states will follow with increasing alarm rates because that means no Trump rallies.. BUT , lets all gather to commit crime. #FakeNews #TruthMatters #AmericaWakeUp
So you believe if Trump quits golfing nobody will ever die again? Dude, I hate to break it to you but people are going to die no matter what. Even after we quit talking about Covid, people wii continue to die.
This is just hilarious. If Trump were the fascist you on the left claim, you have given him countless Kristalnachts to move in and seize control. In fact, the only people who have embraced telling Americans what to do and taking rights away are Democrat mayors and governors.
No Trump is not the 1syt line of defense for a local city. How long have ALL politicians in both sides been in office? And you wanna put all the blame on 1 man who has had less than 4 years? USA was doing great before covid
The only thing I hate about twitter is that Donald Trump has one.
Who has the power to prosecute except the president? Trump do your duty and prosecute all of them.
#trump #thetraitor has no #advisors because he won't listen to them anyway! In his demented mind he is the only one other than #putin #KimJongUn #duarte #saudiking

No reaction from the black guy over a Trump supporter murder and threatening bloodshed to our federal agents.  Oh well,     ‚Äúnow let‚Äôs go to another caller‚Äù.
You know its the lunatic and not the wife, no one else could be this obsessed with Trump.
Far from Trump‚Äôs fault...
How much you wanna bet Trump's billion-dollar disaster didn't specify ASCE-16 wind mitigation in their SOW?
Are KY and LA really indicative though? That‚Äôs like using MA and MD to say Trump will win in a landslide
Trump may be behind but I‚Äôm 99.9% certain that‚Äôs by 4-5% and not double digits
Biden could very well win but SC? I‚Äôd bet my home and my entire life savings on Trump getting a similar margin there as in 2016
Trump is definitely a Russian asset. A Manchurian president. A Russian Trojan Horse.
That's absolutely the reason.  He's not well at all #RESIGN #RESIGN #RESIGN #RESIGN #RESIGN #RESIGN #trump #thetraitor
Did you see the latest CBS poll? Trump wins Ohio. Sad.....
Trump Will Win again oh yes he will,
Because Fox news is being Left wing in many areas, Like  and Juan Williams, and many others I just do not watch, TRUMP will WIN again he has my vote, I do not believe Polls Nope,
Trump 2020 and if not since the polls say biden they are the same pools said Trump down in 2016 Fixed, Biden will destroy this country and he wont run it his VP will how sad
So should trump.
True but without Fairfax, Loudon, Prince William, Trump would have won VA by about 4
Actual U.S deaths from covid are severely inflated for reasons for example to blame and make Trump look bad. The Dems will stop at nothing for power.
Always believed that even if Trump loses he likely wins Ohio by 4-5%

JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN!!!
This isn't Trump. This is antifa and BLM. This is the far left.
I kinda suspected something like this due  to his inaction. Who is out there who can kick butt? Do we know why Trump appointed Barr? Maybe he was just God‚Äôs choice? Maybe he isn‚Äôt the same as what he was? People do change you know. Preacher said he will raise the bar of justice.
Trump is calling rioting Marxist anarchists destroying public property domestic terrorists. Because they are.
i tried discussing politics with my mother. the moment i called trump a rascist that i didn‚Äôt support she became defensive and asked for proof of *air quotes* the rascist things he‚Äôs said/done. lord oh lord this election will be a shitty year.
Not only trump,,, the whole damn Republican Party, if they so interested in dictatorship they need to go to Russia
That‚Äôs what this account has been for me. Whenever I post I stop and think ‚Äúwhy‚Äù? I never used to do that with Facebook, I‚Äôd post, share, comment, fight, ‚Äúfuck DeSantis‚Äù, ‚Äúfuck Trump‚Äù and all that, but I never realized how negative my feed was... (2/4)

America's Greatest Triumph (Trump) I think the video meant to say. Please fund the cops with more money and better training, not less money. Thanks for showing this video. Now I know I'm voting for Trump's Keep America Strong.
The Law and Trump are one in the same. The citizens of Portland who pay taxes needs to not be worried about basic security!
And just like that the Trump campaign crumbles.
I'm  a part of all three: I detest #trump #thetraitor  I'm a former #republican  I will never vote #republican again
The only reason Trump sent federal troops to your city is because you allowed Portland to become a haven for criminals masquerading as protesters. And now you think defunding the Police is somehow a good idea? Trump has my permission to do what‚Äôs necessary to end this crap!
And you trust Trump?? ü§îü§î
I doubt that the majority of the people of Portland actually think you care about them! Your hatred for Trump is also a hatred of everything that is right for America. If Obama had made the same policy decisions as Trump has made you and the rest of the haters would be overjoyed!
Folks who love America, love Donald Trump.

I don‚Äôt hold it against people for supporting Trump in 2016, it was a hard choice for some people and even though it didn‚Äôt seem that way to me, I understand. However, we‚Äôve now had over 3 years of his ‚Äúpolicies‚Äù and I think at this point the goal should be to have him fade away

Ya don't think everyone in the vicinity of trump is tested daily or more? Lol smhSame could be said for your comments, sir. Please tell us you're not like trump who always thinks he's the smartest person in the room. Do you think you're the smartest person in the room. Sure sounds like it.
Did you know Trump voted illegally? It was in the papers here, but nothing was done of course. See, in FL, you have to list a residential address. M-A-L is not on the books as residential, so Trump actually committed VOTER FRAUD!
Oh. My. God. Can it be? I feel the rapture going through me and not lifting me up because hell no. All because Trump told a truth for once!!
Obama did 2 things that I'd take him 2 task 4, the TPA he wanted, but finally got shamed out of at the last min, n not telling #MoscowMitch 2 piss off 2 even up the playing field after Comey's fucking brain aneurism ouying the HRC emails by throwing the üá∑üá∫ help 4 Trump into play.
Yes at the hands of Donald J Trump
So can we now say that Donald J. Trump KlLLED Cain? AFAF
Not a socialist but I don‚Äôt like Trump. This is still America right?
Not a chance. Biden will win in a landslide and after that, the only unresolved issue will be where to send trump's last presidential check. By the way, these conspiracy theory, worst case scenario stories, serve no real purpose. Report real news and lay off the what if stories.
King Trump?
King Trump??
The crazy thing about this is that nobody utilized all those empty seats.   At the very least, you could have spaced yourselves out a bit.   Herman Cain beat stage 4 cancer, but decided to risk it all for a Trump rally. Sad way to go.   Cover your face. Quit crying about it.

#dyingforTrump I think TRUMP is asymptomatic. A lot of lies and molecules spew from his mouth daily. A lot of people in his admin have contacted #TrumpIsTheVirus Why do these people obey their 'trump god' and not the GOD of the Universe who wants them to live. #TrumpIsNotWell
So, the Attorney General, and this Trump Administration, this Republican Congressman and Women, thus all who voted for them are irrelevant Mr. Nadler.....no sir, you are.

Fine by me. *trump sully's everything he touches.
And  said it is up to the DOJ. It's not. Don't let that little nugget get lost in the truckload of *trump bullshit we have to wade through day in and day out.
Res ipsa loquitur and what a deadly message indeed. trump should be court ordered to visit every grave beyond the 15 or so he predicted back in January when he called Covid a hoax.
*trump and class are two words that should never ever ever be used in the same sentence.
#HermanCain- Don't know much abt him, but condolences to his family. All those who appease Donald Trump's ego abt #mask and #Hydroxychloroquine, pay attention to scientific facts if you want to live.  &amp; others crowding around your 'TrumpGod' Put your family first.
Looks like we are not going to become a lawless nation after all. I think at this point, just about everyone has had enough of trump's and barr's attempts at circumventing the law. I have always believed that there are still good, decent people, who aren't part of trump nation.
Right but my point being if it eliminates Trump for now we can work on the rest later. Choices are so limited
Translation, we are just as ready to be rid of trump as the rest of the world.
Thare is just one case per state every six or seven years, on average of Mail-In voter fraud. We are talking about an occurrence that translates to about 0.00006 percent of total votes cast. Trump's just terrified because you can't cheat if there's a #PaperTrail
*trump doesn't joke. He has no sense of humor whatsoever.
The morning after the #Tulsarally Trump said he never jokes.
Trump wanting to postpone the election is an ACTUAL threat to democracy but people are too busy pretending that politics are about their team winning to rationalize that.
‚ÄòOn the golf course ‚Äî I gotta go‚Äô: Republicans wimp out after being confronted with Trump‚Äôs call to delay elections
Right . Trump can actually think for himself and not a puppet like Biden would be
Yes yes yes ... Trump is going to take over the country, just like you thought.
Trump is terrified . You are so right. He‚Äôs terrified of a rigged election!!! That‚Äôs what he‚Äôs terrified about!!!
Chuck your not telling the whole story again.. king trump just sent in his royal guard to kidnap people. #Cult45 #DementiaDon #ChuckLikesToKissTrumpsAss
Yeah Trump has the right ideas, but often doesn‚Äôt execute them properly. Again if Germany cares about NATO so much, why aren‚Äôt they meeting their contractual obligation? America pointing that out isn‚Äôt the US not being a good partner.

Pres Trump might not be correct. However the Bush team was a complete disaster, and we‚Äôre still paying for their errors. So I don‚Äôt listen any of their criticism.  The Obama team didn‚Äôt have any answers either. I think we need a rethink in the USA, not a return to Bush years

Delay the election but send children back to school now. Got it. trump's statement is purely self-serving, ridiculous, and narcissistic. He wants more time to make his case to America. The 150,000 people that died because he denied Covid and failed to act would like more time.
Trump's DELAY - He will be dragged out of the WH 1/2021 His suggestion of delay Election 2020 tweet is for him to try and get the economy afoot &amp; a speedy vaccine. That Won't Work
Trump can take his #Fracking to Ma-A-Lago to dig for oil! People have died. Stop killing our #Environment US Geo Survey acknowledges drilling for oil&amp; fracking have caused earthquakes! (so why did SJU &amp; Haiti have earthquakes) Stay away fr poor people of color with your poison!
Would Mr. Trump want to delay the election if a democrat were in office?   I know he just loves to throw hand grenades in the room...so let‚Äôs use this as a rallying cry to make sure we have a well run and closely monitored voting process.
Trump tweeted about delay the election shortly after new data showed the economy shrank by a record one-third in the last quarter.   Pathetic and coward..!
July 30th, 2020, the day *trump went full dictator.
What are your thoughts on *trump going full 3rd world dictator this morning, preemptively talking about canceling November? Since you're my Senator, I'd really like a response. ü§î
President Trump has no say on when to hold the General Elections. For the preservation of our democracy, all members of Congress Republican or Democrat, Supreme Court Justices must make it clear the elections will occur in November.
They cannot help themselves.  It makes Trump look bad so it will be blasted across the headlines.  Had we let this virus run its course this would be done already.  But that would not fit the narrative that joe will save the day.

I‚Äôm not a leftist.  More a recovering right winger, but you cannot tell me that old chestnut holds water.  Trump has had over 3 years to fix stockpiles.  He was left with a comprehensive Pandemic Prep plan that he just ignored.  This is Trumps Mess. Let‚Äôs not wipe his ass. Again.
Terrible to have to blame the guys that have been gone over 3 years for all the wrong that Trump creates
This is what real leadership looks like. Real leaders make decisions not based on what's politically expedient but what's best for the populace as a whole. If we had this kind of leadership in Washington fewer families in this country would be in mourning. Trump failed the U.S.
Doctor admits the obvious. The U.S. was slow in recognizing the Covid threat from Europe. No kidding, sherlock. We had a president playing politics with one of the deadliest diseases to hit the world in 100 years. He said the dems made up Covid to hurt him. Trump failed the U.S.
Nothing to worry about here, consider the source. Barr is not credible. The trump administration is in the throw it against the wall and see what sticks phase. Clear sign of desperation. Don't give life to their desperation. Rise above the pettiness and speak to the issues.

Do some research, HCQ is the preferred treatment for COVID world wide.  The US is only country where this drug has been politicized and attacked.  Why?  Because Trump liked it.  How many have the media killed through their jihad against this effective. TDS kills
I always used to begrudgingly say Trump is going to win big in November. Then COVID came and now this. I think we‚Äôre gonna see him lose by somewhere in the range of 15-20 million votes and the house and senate are going to have near super majorities.

What a surprise, trump has told yet another lie. THE GREAT DECEIVER is deceived by his own deception. At this point, trump probably can no longer distinguish between light and darkness, nor good and evil.  He is reprobate.

Explain! oops! You meant to say Donald Trump is straight up lying ALL HIS LIFE &amp; worst since he became POTUS
Bravo to these great gentlemen. If only we had a president who wasn't dillusional enough to believe that he is always the smartest person in the room. trump denied the existence of Covid-19 from day one. Next, he attacked science in an attempt to cover up his stupidity.
People do this because they know that we have a president, and republican senate that are simple-minded enough to believe what they see without a full investigation. trump is easily manipulated and with zero fact checking, will start spreading rumors about anything.
ANYONE but tRump 2020! This Republican will not be voting for Trump!

98% of our representatives including you Trump are an EMBARRASSMENT!!
And now he's dead. His Twitter feed is an endless nasty rant against Democrats. He was a nasty partisan, probably self (Black)-loathing, and he paid dearly for his sycophancy to Trump. Who's using Black people, Mr. Cain? A favorite theme of his to attack Dems. #HermanCain #karma
This congress will never allow an extension of a Trump presidency
Lol, anyone that agrees with Trump is a white supremacist? Let us also remember that Democrat cities are the ones being mismanaged - so much so that they let their own cities get burned to the ground. Sad that democrats have become what they are today!
So very very sad to hear about the death of  üò≠üò≠üò≠ My condolences to his family. He was a great man and a great voice for Donald Trump  and conservatives.
Do you realize that Herman was a grown man capable of making his own decisions?  President Trump didn't ban mask wearing.  Do you people need government to tell you what to do every step of the way in your life or are you capable of making your own decisions?
You people just waking up need to do your research. The only reason this is even being brought to light is because Trump is President. And by the way, Obama covered this up to protect himself and Killary
Trump won‚Äôt go near his funeral. He would  not want to be associated with any reflection or reminder of his incompetence.  Next he‚Äôll say, ‚Äú I hardly knew the guy‚Äù.

Herman Cain is dead from Covid-19. He attended the Tulsa rally with no mask. #Trump #BloodOnHisHands #TrumpVirusCatastrophe #HermanCain #TulsaRally

Now this is Hilarious!! Trump is afraid ... he‚Äôs time is up now because  he fail all Americans with his bad decisions on this pandemic. Pack your stuff Trump. Game over !
Then your tweet makes no sense to me then I guess.  Trump only voters cost us the house and damn near cost us the Senate.  These Walk Away people are going to ruin what we have a chance of rescuing with their liberal policies.  Be vigilant.  It matters.

Shit like this is why you hear Trump distracting with racist tweets and lies about absentee ballots
The big lie is anyone in aAmerica can get a test. Not true!!! Also test results can take 7 to 10 days to get results which is useless. Stop lying and exaggerating. Not hard to see why Trump hired you, a Trump lackey.
Anyone notice that the number of cases started dropping almost immediately after the Trump Administration started requiring the COVID numbers be reported to them and not the CDC?
Trump's reasons, will be made public some day. That's why the Criminal In Chief, is fighting so hard.Not to have his accounting firms,or business tax documents released. Then you will see decades, of money laundering, insurance fraud,&amp;filing false tax returns.Russian backed loans

We have our Trump flags but no yard signs other than for our local Sheriff.  Yesterday was the first yard sign for  that I have seen in our area but I know our area is a RED town because I work the polls (political ones not the stripper ones) every election.

That fiasco yesterday showed America just how clueless and ride your party is. Thanks for making it easier yesterday for Trump to get 4 more years....dummy.
There are 8 other planets in our solar system where the words "donald trump" will mean absolutely nothing.
This is you guys going "high?"  Relishing in the death of an 80 year old man?  Are you going high when you're burning down homes with children inside and blocking firefighters from getting to them?  How about when you murder an innocent black man solely because he supports Trump?

That's an outright lie. There was never any proof that Trump, or his father, denied applicants based on race. There's hearsay on both sides of the issue and ultimately they made Trump put up some signs in black neighborhoods to advertise.
I am confused...I admit it...oh not about trump or even covid...figured those out...bada-bing...bada-boom.. nope...what confuses me is - how many kitchens does Steve Schmidt have?
Folks Don‚Äôt get it twisted. This is the #Trump way of warning  if their not nicer or literally ignore his misinformation which by default makes it true to them viewers or he‚Äôll start Tweeting about individual hosts. God forbid  wouldn‚Äôt find his way home.
But you see, I LIKE my neighbors of different races. It‚Äôs idiots like Trump who I wouldn‚Äôt want to see slinking around it...
