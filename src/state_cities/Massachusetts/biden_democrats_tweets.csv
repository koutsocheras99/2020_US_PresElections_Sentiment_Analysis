I’m more confused than Biden, by that one.....
Notice how Biden used Jim Cyburn in the exact same way.
We need  #vote #Biden #TrumpOrAmerica #TrumpVirus #TrumpCrimeFamily
Hahahaha hey shit for brains, how about that, Joe Biden was right when he said Rump would try to delay the election! Hahaha you’re such a dolt!
I think it’s pretty telling that the vast majority of Bernie supporters are begrudgingly holding their noses and voting for Biden, but the supporter base putting up the biggest fuss is KHive. Remind me how Bernie’s supporters are uniquely vitriolic and rude online?
I do. He is going to create chaos by inciting race riots to make sure Biden is bogged down. Being a sore loser he won't gracefully accept the verdict and may have to be physically kicked to the curb
Oh, you mean showing federal police force that is currently occurring under the Trump administration is not good optics when trying to explain that this is what Biden will bring us?
Biden can’t even tell you what state he’s in, do you honestly think he could figure out how to use Twitter?
Republicans had control of the House from 2010 to 2013, and were responsible for the budgets they’re now attempting to pin on Biden. What a joke.
Biden’s brother bought the island next to pedofile island!
Hiding on Biden’s brothers island.   See Biden’s brother bought the island next to pedofile island.   Of it’s true.  Look it up!
needs to start holding more TV interviews. ESPECIALLY when  tries to demolish our democracy by suggesting to move #ElectionDay. #Biden should be RUNNING to the nearest TV camera when #Trump does this. We NEED to hear from a real leader, not this
Joe Biden feels differently. 😂😂
Biden will kill Trump in the debates
The question is ... will you willingly hand that playbook over to President Biden?
He's just clever enough to see that he could turn it in his favor either way. A slim margin of victory for Biden = dispute it because surely there were miscounts.   A massive blue tsunami = "CORRUPTION! FAKE VOTES!" Because he also believes he's too wonderful to lose.
#wewillvote  For biden ofcourse
Actually little bot. It wouldnt be hard. The millitary would NOT be obligated to protect the little sociopath once the executive protection is removed.  Then when biden is sworn in. The military would be obligated to follow his orders. It'll be the best eviction ever
Winning?  Hes behind biden pretty much anywhere. And every stupidity driven desperation tactic is failing.  Winning how?
Wouldn't be surprised if he votes for Biden, actually.
🇺🇸 TRUMPGATE USA 🇺🇸  VIRUS JOBLESS ECONOMY YOU ARE KILLING PEOPLE. YOU  ARE GREAT PROVE IT. PROOF IS WHAT THE  AMERICA PEOPLE  WANT. JOE BIDEN THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THIS GUY DOESN'T WORK FOR THE PEOPLE HE WORKS FOR HIM
Yes Joe Biden was right in saying, If Trump spent  more time running the country then twitting all day the country would be in better shape.
At what point do people stop making excuses for this guy? How many times can you look like a complete dunce saying “you’re over reacting, he wouldn’t do that”, and then he does it? I don’t care about Joe Biden but anyone would be better than the guy helping tear the country apart
Donald Trump is doing more to get Biden elected than the Biden campaign and the DNC combined.
Biden isn't a puppet for Hillary. But... not the end of the world if true.
Seriously. Biden's nomination divided progressives from the rest of the Democrats. Now Trump is like "Biden is being controlled by Bernie, AOC and the radical left". If we choose to believe him, Biden gains enthusiasm.
Everyone lies you lie Biden lies cnn lies
How sad.   Democrats have made Biden their top candidate to represent them in the upcoming Presidential elects.  Simply pathetic.
The problem is that people that need Biden in power have no choice but to run him and hope he wins. While bringing in someone else would be better, these people would get replaced so they don't want that. Basically, they hope that Biden somehow can last to election day.
This “ambition” thing is absurd. A politician. Ambitious!!! No!!! The same as the foolishness about Senator Harris going after VP Biden in that debate. That’s politics. Give me a break!!!
Is this the same Joe Biden that's threatening to arrest activists?
Exactly and noone is doing a damn thing to stop him.  VOTE BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
Actually til 1/20/21, unless we can get Biden in early.
🇺🇸 TRUMPGATE USA 🇺🇸  JOE BIDEN GOOD FOR AMERICA. ECONOMY VIRUS JOBLESS GREAT JOB ASSHOLE. YOU ARE  GOING DOWN.
Could someone explain why Biden’s son, Pelosi’s son, Kerry’s son and Romney’s son all got filthy rich in Russia?   With no real experience?  Gonna blame that on Trump too?
not to mention since Biden said he will be a one-term president shouldn't his VP start running for president the day of the inauguration?
Question:   When Kamala burps; why do we smell Biden?
Biden Actually Said This: "We Can't Rebuild Our Economy and Meet This CRIMATE CLISIS Unless We Create Opportunities For People..." (VIDEO)  via
During this time of political uncertainty, we also are seeing uncertainty with tax planning. Congress cut corporate and individual tax rates in 2017, and now Joe Biden is campaigning to increase taxes. Sandra O'Neill offers some advice:   #taxplanning
Sorry, I meant she’s who I think Biden might choose as AG, not necessarily who I’d choose. And there’s a difference between VP (who you have to announce before the election) and AG (who you announce after the election).
🇺🇸 TRUMPGATE USA 🇺🇸  Bankruptcy thats with your company. Now he is trying to run America he is bad for America don't vote for Trump  Vote JOE BIDEN NOVEMBER 3RD. NOT FOR THE VIRUS THATS THE Trump virus great job idoit

Who will Joe Biden pick as his VP?  joins us at 7:05am to talk about the #Veepstakes.  The only thing we know for sure is it will be a woman.
Erroneous argument. No candidate is entitled to votes. Not Bernie, nor Yang, especially not Biden. So to admonish a freshman rep for not adhering to "the game plan" is antithesis to being an independent, wouldnt you say?
She'll get community service as punishment. Handing out Biden flyers.
And Biden didn't deploy federal secret police to brutalize and kidnap peaceful blm protesters, but hey, who's keeping track?
Joe Biden in 2008: “All Rudy Giuliani says is a noun, a verb, and 9/11!”  Everyone in 2020: “All Joe Biden says is a noun, a verb, and Barack Obama!”
I'm bored and curious, who do you think Biden will pick for his VP? (Think, not want.)  I only get 4 option here, but there are so many, so feel free to comment your pick if I don't have yours listed.
So you're saying I shouldn't critique Biden BEFORE he's sworn in, is that it?
not the point i realize but did politico really blow right through an embargo on Biden’s VP pick? bc if so, lol
If anybody in their right mind thinks Joe Biden is okay they look just as crazy as him and if anybody doesn't want to vote for Trump and they vote Democrat the Democrats are ruining this world wake up people
🇺🇸 TRUMPGATE USA 🇺🇸    VOTE JOE BIDEN HE IS NOT FAKE. How is the virus the economy and jobless rate shit sleepy Donald Trump. The first president to work against the people not for the American people.
🇺🇸 TRUMPGATE USA 🇺🇸  Everyone he is cutting Medicare and social security. Trump don't trust him. He is going to screw with health care VOTE JOE BIDEN HE DOESN'T LIE ABOUT EVERYTHING.
Dear  do you want to get rid of the MF in the WH or not? Endorse Biden, FFS!
Wonder if Biden smart enough to pick her as VP candidate.

Why did Obama/Biden give away Billions of Dollars to other countries??????   It’s F.B.S.!
You do know that Biden has been in office before and him and Obama did great that is why he is former VP,  Trumpa Dump is in office now and we have corona white supremacy troops that trump hired to attach us racial issues going on Biden did the job once before
Because he's the president of the United States, right? So, I assume you loved Obama too, right? For the same reason. He was your president. And when Biden gets elected in November, you'll love him too. Right? And you won't care what anyone says. Right?
Trump slams 'deranged Anarchists and Agitators,' predicts chaos if Biden wins election  This is like an oxy moron. It's been chaos since day one of Trump taking office. Biden would be the alternative.
Once again! The Future of this Nation is at stake!! Elect Biden or this country is finished!!!
These are Joe Biden's shock troops
If we want to make America great again, we must all vote for Biden. It is the only way back to normalcy and progress.
Can I major in selling kids to Joe Biden?
I get it I compromised my ideals to vote for the lesser of two evils in 2016, turns out the “safe option” actually loses quite often. And even if you vote for Biden if he loses it will still be your fault
Love Biden! Your nuts! Russia China Lie Bird 🐪😂 Try this one! Really hard test!
Donnie how come you’re blaming Biden for all the chaos in USA now. I know you are a complete corrupt idiot but you are the president now. Shock the world and try doing your job and stop your whining baby bull shit.
🇺🇸 TRUMPGATE USA 🇺🇸  JOE BIDEN WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.  THIS STUMP HAS IT ALL SCREWED UP. TRUMP MADE IT shit again. Did you take your bleach today. Worse president EVERY. IN HISTORY
Of course. Trump says he won’t go and pay respects to John Lewis at Capitol  #SmartNews
Hopefully 2021 is Return of the Joe Biden
Not coting for Biden, sorry. I’m suppoting Jo Jorgenson.

A real President, let's get Biden that Nov 3rd.
Solidarity with these delegates doing the hard work to try and get Biden to support Medicare for All during a pandemic. This is indeed what resisting should be.

Biden should really refuse to debate Trump. Why debate someone who is mentally unfit, has been impeached, is a conman and traitor who colluded with Russia, is a fascist white supremacist, and responsible for the deaths of over 150,000 Americans and counting by the day?
Probably harming Biden in the most recent polling
🇺🇸 TRUMPGATE USA 🇺🇸  You are making it worse but you don't do anything right. All of the polls are looking bad for you. If you don't leave they will take you I would like to see that. You are killing Americans how do feel?  Everyone don't vote for the stump Trump. VOTE Joe BIDEN
If my vote in Massachusetts for Biden mattered, then I would vote for him against Trump.  Instead, I'll probably vote for

Oh yeah?  Watch them.  You are finished, in Pennsylvania, and nationwide.  Biden's going to win the electoral and popular vote and you'll be out.  Then we get to watch you go to jail for all the crimes you thought you'd get away with because you were the president. #TRE45ON

Biden/Rice,  Biden/Rice Biden/Rice, Biden/Rice did I say Biden/Rice
Joe Biden literally was the first black presidents pick to run the nation if something were to happen to him. Trump s a racist.
There is a difference. While many people do not like how Trump conducts himself, the general view is Trump is doing what he wants. The view with Biden is that he becomes confused and does not know what he wants to say or where the conversation is going.
Thanks so much for putting together this training! Very informative with ways we can all help elect Joe Biden as our next president! 🇺🇸
He must have an income stream from Chinda, like lot's of politicians. Just like Joe and Hunter Biden
At this point a goat is better But biden is qualified atleast unlike trumpty dumpty  #GestapoTrump
Seriously dude. We’re fucked no matter which way you put it. Biden’s response to police brutality was “shoot them in the leg”
I’m still waiting for Biden to condemn Trump’s authoritarian use of federal agents to crush protests. He seriously hasn’t even commented on it since the church stunt in Washington. Where is the leadership??
What’s hard to understand about Biden is a large part of the reason we have trump. Voting for the lesser of two evils for decades is why we are here. This is way bigger than just getting rid of trump
I suspect that in many white communities, many are afraid to voice support for Biden, but will secretly vote for him.
The 'counter to Trump; is reason and logic; but people who have been running their lives on emotion for decades are no longer capable of doing that; so the Democrats run Biden and will scream when he loses.
Biden's time to become President has passed and he is going to lose the election. While many people do not like Trump, they are not going to put someone that is going senile into the most important job on the planet.
As bad as people think Trump is, Biden is not going to win in 2020. Biden is having problems on the campaign trail and showing signs of mental decline, where he clearly becomes confused as to what he wants to say. Someone else should be put in to run as the candidate but won't.
Do you really think that the people who support our President read your crap and think:" Oh,ok. This guy says people aren't voting for President Trump in November. I guess I'll vote for Biden"?  We aren't like libtards. We aren't sheeple.
The most exp &amp; 8+ years with Biden &amp; she is very strong &amp; won't let the R's get away with anything!

Obama inherited a disaster, and handed to struggling homeowners to Steve Mnuchin and Wilbur Ross to fleece.  Biden was his VP at the time, and Biden is about to inherit a bigger disaster.  Sorry, but I have little faith in the party that refuses to hold Trump accountable.

Idk but keep in mind Biden is crushing in basically every state in the country and that does have a trickle down effect
Lol meanwhile my whole family and I have already decided we’re out on Biden, my dad says he’ll never vote for a Dem again lmao
But the worst thing is that it’s WORKING.... if/when Biden blows out Trump in Nov., the Dems will have a veritable Neoliberal/Republican mandate to govern with, especially if they retake the senate
#ImVoting4BidenBecause... well I can’t because I’m too young. Which is exactly why you should vote.  If Trump is to be re-elected he will leave a country devastated by his regime that is to be inherited by millions of young Americans.  For America’s future, vote for Biden.
🇺🇸 TRUMPGATE USA 🇺🇸  Everyone vote for  JOE BIDEN HE DOESN'T LIE LIKE Trump. We need a real President not a shit bag.     VOTE JOE BIDEN you know a real MAN NOT A WUSSY.  Dump the stump  Trump.
Whoever Biden’s VP is going to be, they’re 100% compromises. The Biden Democratic Party is going to be a vessel for corporate America, plain and simple
Is the Ukraine Biden 'indictment' story valid? If so, any word on why no arrest warrants issued through Interpol. And if it happens, Does Fed fight extradition on behalf of Biden, or does DOJ turn away, and left FBI/Marshalls do what they do?

How Joe Biden got greener - The Washington Post
Who needs logic, right? If you don’t think Biden’s Administration would work with a variety of departments and organizations (especially regarding science, economics, etc) to improve public health and return Americans to the work place, you must not think before you speak.
On election night, even if many votes are not yet counted, we'll still know that you lost the election.  Biden will win by a landslide.  Intelligent Americans are fed up with having an incompetent criminal in the White House.
Postponing the election will cause a longer wait.  We will vote on Nov. 3, whether at the polls or by mail, and we will wait patiently to welcome Joe Biden as our president.  Having to wait for the results doesn't change the outcome.  #Biden2020
It’s plausible Biden will do more for reform &amp; racial tensions than Trump, who has more than sold out to his base who sees not much wrong with enforcement as is. But if he can also listen to experts in many fields on how to get people back to work safely, employment ⬆️ protest ⬇️
One of the main issues now is that federal agents are going after protestors &amp; not just rioters. You could argue it’s just the media perception distributing that, but we’d probably both agree then that the perception would shift when Biden was elected. Biden’s a good corporatist.
I don’t know if your opinion is rooted in fact.  One stance I could take is how Biden vs. Trump would handle the pandemic. If Biden’s admin can quell the virus better than Trump &amp; get people back to work life safely faster than Trump can, unemployment resolved faster &gt; less riots
Sanders won in numerous states (mine included) where exit polls showed he won by a significant margin, while the DP vote count declared Biden the winner. We cannot support a corrupt party that steals elections for 1% psychopaths who would destroy the majority to continue to rule.
The important thing right now is to get Trump out of office and the only way to do that is to vote for Biden. Voting anyone else would be foolish as it would guarantee Trump’s re-election. Political issues are secondary and they can be debated and negotiated once Trump is gone.
#WeWillVote for Vice President Biden!
if he resigns before the election, he can forever say he did not lose to Biden
if he resigns in the next month or so, he can go to his grave telling everyone Biden did not beat him
There will be less rioting  Most of the rioting is happenin from the police anyway. I’m half kiddin, but let’s call tear gassing protestors the fed’s version of “rioting.”  All Biden needs is to people back to working again, &amp; to do even moderate police reform. Workers don’t riot

Trump Can’t Stop the Election, But He Can Threaten Democracy
All Trump needs is a handful of sycophant Govs to delay their elections to sow chaos, and manufacture a crisis.  Imagine GA, FL, NC, AZ  all postpone, and Biden gets to 267 electoral votes on Nov 3.
Trump/gop policies continue to increase deaths.They WANT people to die off to keep control over all.  We can't sit back and watch like a DP that sabotaged the one politician capable of pulling us out of this terrifying mess.  They rig &amp; offer weak unfit Biden. We can't cave. Act.
Sadly troops died under Bush’s misguided wars, &amp; thereafter under the feckless policies of the Obama-Biden Administration.  Several in my family are &amp; were highly decorated military.  Thankfully, none were killed in combat.   In case you didn’t know? It doesn’t snow in Sicily.
Biden's running during an escalation of deaths due to intentionally mismanaged COVID policy. Heard nothing fr Biden to address it, except an adamant refusal to implement &amp; support M4A. This man is unfit on every level, choosing health  industry profit over protecting human lives.

A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn’t pretty

sorry to be cruel, but Biden has no problem supporting policies that damage the majority to protect corporate greed.
more of Biden's lies and omissions.
what WE can do in response is not vote for Biden.  Write in Sanders.
The vote can't be delayed, so get that out of your desperate little mind.  If you refuse to leave the WH after Biden is sworn in, you'd be trespassing and could be forcibly removed.  I like that.

Keeping busy is a must.  Walking/exercise is a mood elevator...those endorphins!  Staying in touch with friends and having pleasant conversation.  Comedy movies/TV are a good distraction.  Voting for Biden in Nov. will be the best thing to do for myself.

NOT VOTING FOR BIDEN.
Well, I hope I gave you some motivation. Fact is, Biden isn't "progressive," but his ideology is more in line with the left than a lot of people realize. And this pandemic seems to have pushed him even farther left. He's been sounding like a Big Time Lib since March.
I mean, is it true that Trump is a fucking Lizard monster in an orange human skin-suit who's broken so many laws (with impunity!) that he should be in jail rather than the oval office? Yes. Sorry. I couldn't hold that in anymore. But, I did give you facts on Biden first. Lol
I get paid to do political research &amp; writing, so I'm fairly well-versed on the subject. Yelling never changes minds; facts might. I'm not stoked on Biden--I'm very much registered Dem to vote for progressives, too, but party infighting is what got us into this clusterfuck.
The Senate is gone.  Trump can still pull it out if Biden goes all Biden in the debates
your man who swore to cut SS and Medicare.  Sure Biden isn't a closet far right Republican?  I'm voting Bernie Sanders.
I see you get that Biden will establish some of the same policies/behavior as trump.  Like pretending peaceful protesters are anarchists. And that the Fed troops illegally sent in to Portland are peaceful police.
If Biden is truly ahead in all the polls then ask yourselves why are they pulling their hair out and freaking out so much?
Electing Biden is acceptg fascism. He will change zero. In many states, exit polls showd large discrepancy bet votes for Sanders &amp; Biden. Sanders clearly won in those states yet Biden was declared winner. THAT is Fascism, so is raiding treasury for rich while forcing poor 2 repay

Have you heard ‘Rich Rubino: Biden Veepstakes - Crunch Time’ by Talk of the Commonwealth on #SoundCloud? #np
That was kind of the point. Biden is trying to make it mandatory that low income housing complexes get built into the more affluent suburbs. I spent my whole life in crappy triple deckers in a crap inner city. I don’t think I deserve nice suburbia unless I work my way to it.
Yeah I’m new to the game but the first time I heard Corporatist was when I read an intercept article on him. Honestly if the one good thing Biden does in his administration is legalize pot id consider it one of the best presidencies since eisenhower

Truly sad ,whoever is holding Biden to run, they have no shame. The man has problems, let him be released from running for president.

Ah yes Biden the man who totally supports a healthcare plan that will be helpful for all Americans and totally wouldn't doom the most vulnerable demographic of COVID-19 victims
then why hasn't the DP &amp; Biden identified critical issues as part of their DP platform to help people recover from decades long stagnant wages, high cost of essential products, health care bankruptcies, major loss of protest &amp; voting rights, just for a start.
The DP has no intention of moving the country forward.   They intend to maintain the status quo exactly as it is. That's why they shut out Sanders again to  name Biden--in mental decline-- as the primary winner. Will the American ppl allow a bribed DP to get away with this again?
Imagine what they would say if Trump went to a presser with a list of reporters names, the questions each was going to ask, and the answers all written in little index cards.  Even with all that prep, Biden still can't get through it without babbling about nonsense.
Biden is incapable of being an FDR or  a progressive. Bernie Sanders policies picks up where FDR left things. Sanders should be running for President.  I've left the DP for removing him.
Not this time. Biden is well known and people like him. #Vote
Biden to Announce His Pick for Vice-President Next Week
add McConnell, Barr and Biden and you have my top 4 to go.
I would absolutely *love it* if Biden picked Harris because there is a non-zero chance the VP will be president in this situation
This is quick calculation so could be missing something but if Trump wins Wisconsin and below in this list, wouldn't the Electoral college be tied, and wouldn't the Current House break the tie, thus picking Biden?
Centrists really just see Joe Biden being a racist right in front of their eyes and straight-up choose not to see it
I find the insinuation that Joe fucking Biden will destroy the Republicans to be so ill-informed it's almost a joke  Let's be real, he loves the Republicans, he almost is one himself
Stupid. I've never heard of Karwn Bass and I don't know anything g about her. They all attacked each other. Get over it Dodd.  ‘She had no remorse’: Why Kamala Harris isn't a lock for VP  via
All Biden needs are a few more Trump interviews like the one with Chris Wallace.  He doesn’t need to do a thing, except stay out of trouble.
Then how do you explain Trumps delusions? Biden is at least a decent person. Trump is not. He has untrained enforcement attacking moms and vets. #TrumpGestapo
There is no way Joe Biden is actually tweeting. This is a staff member or his wife. She seems to be his handler and the competent brain  of this couple. It is sad to watch his confusion play out so publicly.
she has been in her current relationship for over 3 years and i’d rather her endorse biden than trump 🤷‍♀️
Trump sucks in general and is racist in particular. That is all.

Especially when the alternative is a egomaniac idiot fascist. This is literally how Biden got the nom. Middle of the road politics has a better chance of beating Trump than a borderline authoritarian socialist.
Who Is actually gonna say this?  Socialists hate his policies and liberals literally just want Trump out. Are there unironically Joe Biden stans in existence or is this hyperbole?
People who vote for Biden are the same people who take out 50k-100k school loans just so they do fine arts or grade school teaching.
If we’re using “impactful” in a value-neutral way, the answer is Donald Trump.  I’d love for Biden to have more of an impact, on the courts and administrative agencies, but he’ll have a lot of work to undo.
How Biden Is Trying to Reach Trump-Weary Republicans
I think nancy pelosi has the same verbiage issues as biden
I don’t think we’ll see marijuana legalized in this administration, his. That’s why I would have voted for Bernie in 2016 and voted Gary Johnson back then, and would have voted Bernie again this time or Yang even. Neither Biden nor 45 are going to legalize it.
Not saying Biden is evil.  He is unfit to serve as president.
What's ironic to me is that Biden is probably the lowest functioning candidate of them all in the 2020 primaries. 🤣
Biden to pay tribute to Lewis at Capitol on Monday
I saw 1 lawn sign yesterday. I live in a very liberal area. In 2016 Clinton and Warren signs and bumper stickers were everywhere.  2020 I've seen 5 or 6 of these 👇  and only 1 Biden sign.  There is absolutely no enthusiasm for Biden in my area.

We need to stop Joe Biden effective immediately defend the police we have to get more Policeman on fourth if not we are at risk high risk I don’t wanna defend the police it’s up to you to get Joe Biden stop his campaign and shut him down forever it’s your callTo destroy Joe Biden
I'm not voting for Biden but my heart goes out to him
Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Most Americans, many in red states, no longer want a so-called president who represents only white, rich republicans.  We're ready to return to decency, integrity, honesty and diversity.  And that's why Joe Biden will win.  You are an insult to the intelligence of Americans!
Yeah there hasn’t because joe Biden isn’t a narcissistic attention seeker with psychofantic followers. Joe is a real leader who doesn’t need his ego stroked like you.
5. I am what my aunt calls a “bleeding heart liberal.” I will be voting for Joe Biden in November.
My only counterpoint would be that the networks may pressure him to do it because the ratings would be through the roof.  At this point it has to be a toss up for the Biden campaign. It's bad it they do, bad if they don't. They are just trying to find a credible excuse.
And it starts. Biden wins, and it will be all about cutting spending to take care of the deficit THE REPUBLICANS CREATED.

I'm NOT in Scott, not promoting a 1% backing/backed man in serious mental decline.  Biden is being hidden by DP. No public appearances, no spontaneous speeches. Yet another scam perpetrated on the country &amp; Americans by a corrupt bought DP.
Vote for Biden!!! #DumpTrump
Are you really challenging Biden’s intelligence when you make mistakes everyday? #IdiotInChief
If Biden refuses to debate, or finds a way to wiggle out of it, many they can just do a round of Jeopardy. That would be entertaining. 😏🤣🤣🤣
It’s so different here. I see 1 Trump sign for every 10 Biden.
I love my daughters. One’s voting against Trump. One’s voting for Trump.  Neither is voting for Biden.
Joe Biden's caring???  Despicable.  Name 10 things he did for Americans for the past 5 decades.
these are the exit polls from Sanders Biden primaries. It's clear Sanders won.  So, again, let's demand the DP reinstate the real winner and move on to a much better future.
exit polls showed Sanders won over Biden in numerous states.
yes, hellish even with the usual DP lesser of two evils, this time with biden
You just want to use trump out if office as an excuse to be complacent and shove racism under the rug.  Go back to the way things were.  Cause news flash.  Obama didn't give two shits about Eric gardner.  Gave two shits about the crime bill biden helped make. You won't respond
I would crawl from my deathbed to vote for Joe Biden and save the country I love from your horrible father. Donald Trump is the incompetent. He is corrupt and stupid. I am not  "radical" or "left".  I always voted Republican, as did my entire family. Not this time.
Tell me Who in their right mind will vote for Biden besides PinkHats and Girly Men? No One!
I hate Joe Biden with all my heart
I think that's true. Biden supporters have an emotional drive to do this as well as a rational one if it ends up tamping down criticism. You know Republicans will be complaining about bad coverage so Democrats need to as well. It's working the refs.
If I am an editor do I encourage my reporters to research? Politically cynical things Biden has done? Or crimes against humanity from 45?  How much time should be devoted to each of these things? For every bad thing Biden has done, Trump's done 100. Coverage should match that.
This badly misrepresents the problem. It's not an issue of not reporting facts, it's an editorial question. Which facts? And how much page space or air time to devote to them. Biden had eggs for breakfast. Do we need to know that? Is not reporting on his breakfast self censoring?
He's just going to correct the "Biden has been in government" part and not the rest of that grammatical abomination?
Someone just said Trump thinks he'll catch up during the debates. Really? WHY would Biden even bother to debate, he's already winning? Let Trump continue to sink himself. Every time he opens his stupid mouth he shows who he is and what he knows. Actions speak louder than words.
Again. Does Biden not have his own merits? Separate from Trump?
On Tuesday, Joe Biden unveiled a 10-year $775-billion plan to support what he deemed "the caring economy," with #realestate investors designated for funding support. Learn more from  senior real estate industry analyst
Want to know what Obama said and did to manipulate Sanders into stepping down while backing an unfit, mentally declining Biden.
Not aware of the Lincoln Project. But why is there a problem with legitimate criticism, even censure, of both DP &amp; Biden?  DP rigged another election &amp; installed an unfit Biden, who hasn't been seen in-person or spoken in public for how long?  Unconscionable.
Ok but can we have someone do this with Biden’s voice, saying the same things... and then have Trump see it. Cause he’d call Biden all sorts of mentally off 🤣   #personmanwomancameratv
Joe Biden.  Please promise us that you will not have a POTUS personal twitter page.  Thanks,  All Americans.
Does anyone believe the police would behave differently under a President Biden?   Trading a TV racist for a politcal racist wouldn’t stop racist police practices and racist police defending their racist jobs.  Putting Biden at the top of a racist system will not fix things.
Senate Republicans secure impeachment witness who flagged concern about Hunter Biden #SmartNews
I am truly happy that Trump has finally decided to follow Joe Biden’s lead by wearing a mask.    Too snarky?
“Obama, who wouldn’t even endorse Biden until everyone else was out of the primaries”  You dumb fuck. Obama endorsed Biden about 11 years ago when he chose him as his Vice President. Just shut the hell up.
Biden, Obama defend their handling of police issues and criticize Trump administration
"Biden will eat every child under four in the entire country," Trump continued. "I will not eat any children. Biden will personally set fire to your house and salt the earth beneath the ashes. I will give you brand new siding and free cable for life!"
“Biden and the equality warriors” has a nice ring to it.  🤬  Here’s the article for easy reference if anyone wants to read it.
I don't speak in rhetoric. I talk facts &amp; will speak when &amp; as I choose.  If you checked my bio, you'd know I detest Trump. Biden is a 50 year centrist.  FGS, propagandist,  check his record before YOU speak.
Remember when we had a progressive  candidate running for president and you trashed him in favor of Joe Biden ahead of major primaries.
I know.  Biden NEEDS. To take it,   Just the fact that trump is going on tv, still talking about it and no one told him the truth yet, what the test means 🤣😂.  My puppy needs me to play,   She barks at me when I pick up my phone. 🤪.   I’ll tweet  later.😍
Obama Says Biden 'Cares,' Will 'Pay Attention to Science' and Unite America
&amp; the Polls say Biden is leading?🤔 ...No. 94 crime bill. Written by Biden. Patriot Act. Yeah that was Biden. The democrats have given Trump just about everything he wants. Caging children happened when Biden was VP. The neoliberal capitalists gave us Trump. Biden gave us Trump. Biden is far right.
Biden isn't going to make those changes. He has always been a republic dressed with a D, and for some reason, you believe the democrats are the good guys even though they keep moving further and further right. Biden is a known pathological liar.
Lololololol.  Biden would have to be left for him to do that. He's far-right.
This dude disgusts me. The fact that settle for Biden is a slogan is so fvcking gross. People like  clearly do not understand why it is we have Trump. Let me tell you. It's Biden.

Maybe Joe Biden?  Isn’t he getting the briefings now too?
either option is shitty for Biden. Just like how this entire process has unfolded in the last 2-3 weeks. This all could have been much better. If he wanted it to...
are these series of Kamala is the reincarnation of the devil leaks from old white men a result of Biden already having told them she is the pick? And they dont like it?  Or Biden testing the waters to see if any of these slanders stick, thereby not selecting Kamala.
oh boy the other corrupt party that uses victims for votes!  all the crime cesspools and police problems are in longtime blue cities.  And Biden has helped no one in 50yrs and touches kids.  but yay for your feelings!
Biden is as much a socialist as Reagan, who by the way signed a bill to ban assault weapons. It's more like Biden against Fascism, Racism, Nepotism, Sexism, &amp; Division
Many people are looking extra closely at this VP pick due to the fact that Biden will probably not seek a second term if elected. There’s a very good chance that his VP will succeed him as president
This is bad. It gives Trump even the weakest leg to stand on. (And don’t think he’ll be bothered by the contradiction of using this while smearing Biden with China.)
You have a serious problem if you think Joe Biden is a healthy man.   Get some guidance.
C) Leave now. Don't vote for Biden.
You overestimate Biden. it’s gonna be like 2016 again except you dropped out early and are supporting a man that can’t complete a coherent sentence. Yes Hillary is evil but at least she’s an evil genius.
The left has already exploited the China virus to make fraudulent mail in voting the norm. Concealing Biden’s dementia is I’m sure within their capacity to further enable their Communist cabal.
Don't get distracted: the election won't be delayed and Covid won't be managed. We need to keep our eyes on the ball and make sure everyone votes. Oh, and remember  endorsed Biden today. #TeamJoe #Hamilton #bidencoalition #VoteThemAllOut #VoteThemAllOut2020
Ha ha ha!!!  Ha ha!!! I love watching Trump squirm while he looks for ways to cheat so he can win. He made his own noose.  First term FAIL! BIDEN 2020!
We’ve read “1984”, but didn’t read this new chapter below in the latest edition.
Totally agree. I love Warren as my senator and hope that she can stay in the Senate continuing to create pressure from the left. Her roll on the Senate will be vital to keep Biden from moderating too much.
I don't agree with that. But I also believe that mail in voting opens the door to to many fraud issues! For instance,if someone votes Trump,before it's counted some could easily mark it for Biden making that voting ballet void!Nevermind being lost in the mail!

Opinion | Joe Biden accused Trump of trying to delay the election. He should know better.
Mr president you were on a roll the last couple weeks now you just gave the dems the ammunition they were looking for delay the election that is absurd and will give it to Biden  #Trump2020
Look electoral college will be 467 to 71. Ruthless lockdowns flip CA &amp; NY. Biden plank of millions of units of Section 8 housing to the suburbs flips NJ CT. Riots in their largest cities flip WA &amp; OR. Flynn for US Senate flips RI. Scorched earth leaves Dems with lL MD VA DE MA VT
Ruthless Cuomo and Newsom lockdowns flip CA &amp; NY. Biden plank to move millions of Section 8 housing units to the suburbs flip NJ &amp; CT. Riots in Portland &amp; Seattle flip OR &amp; WA. Electoral College blowout 467 to 71.
No better strategy to make me root for  selection as  running mate.
Biden with anyone is just NO GOOD
But is anyone looking for Biden?
Biden wants someone simpatico and ready. We all know why.
Biden is a complete mess! In Chicago in particular,Trump sent in help! FBI,ETC agent's to help police departments investigate the uptic in violent crimes. In Portland,it's a complete shitshow! Law and order needs to be established. If the local officials won't,the Fed's will!
Come on - is this question for real? Anyone who has watched/listened to  recently realizes that he couldn't be the leader of a kindergarten class at this point, let alone the free world! Jill Biden &amp; the Democraps should be ashamed of themselves, but they have no shame.
Biden can end this with the VP announcement.   It is still his choice, but he is in a quandary now - if he doesnt pick Kamala, is it because (i) she said no, (ii) they mutually decided they couldnt work together, or (iii) he listened to his bundlers and Dodd?
So? Biden is literally a former VP running for President.

Just curious.. Anybody else sick to death of the vice president nonsense?? Biden had a piece of paper with Kamala Harris's name on it, Biden said Kamala Harris four times in one day, Kamala, Kamala, Kamala..Please give it a rest.
Swap out “Sleepy Joe Biden” with “”Corrupt Donald Trump” and “Radical Left” with “Russia” and it will be your first honest statement since taking office.

Joe Biden destroyed this country and is responsible for why we have Trump. Things were hit before 2016. You are only noticing it now.
Must be looking at Joe Biden being the president and ruining the country. Donald will save us!
It's not in Biden's power to meet their demands anyway.
It’s Biden or the imbecile who couldn’t prevent the deaths of 150,000 Americans and tens of millions of lost jobs. Gosh- tough choice...
I honestly don't care what Biden thinks because Biden isn't so arrogant to ignore what his party wants him to do.
I think it matters way, way less because Biden will be beholden to his party in a way that Trump isn't. Trump is a self-absorbed egotist who has been trying his damndest to make himself a dictator since he got into office. Biden is just a mediocre politician.
A riot is the language of the unheard. Biden's going to crack down on the protests, too, answering calls to end state violence with... state violence.
OMG! You must be so concerned. 😂😂😂
People scream about Republicans being dumb with their identity politics, with how they only care about "Owning the Libs" and then make headass statements like this saying "Joe Biden good because Democrat herpaderpaderp"

This is the saddest ad ive ever seen in my life! Joe Biden wrote the crime bill he doesn’t support defunding the police! It’s kinda fucking hilarious.
I just got an email from the campaign pitching a video chat with Biden and Warren if I donated, so...I have no idea.
I don’t know. I wasn’t that familiar until this from the  though I left CA 1.5 years ago... “She’s the first Black woman in the U.S. to lead a legislative house. Will Karen Bass soon be VP?”
How high up does the corruption go for the Obama/Biden illegally spying ?
Biden campaign did
Pointing blame are we! There's a flip side to that coin! The previous administration,should have had a stock like of ppe for such an emergency! The Trump administration wanted to state shutting shit down in January,but he was called a racist! And why isn't Biden talking about it!
Yes, I get that candidates make concessions to win the nom. There is no ideologically pure candidate, but the degree to which Biden has been radicalized to the far left is nothing close (IMO) to the degree to which the rank and file GOP has been radicalized to the extreme right.
Oh for sure, I don't dispute that.  But my counter is - is there actually a candidate in either party who actually encapsulates that middle? My take all along has been that Biden is about as close as you're gonna get.
I think this is again though where a lot of the Twitter noise conflates actual popular sentiment. Biden's platform is something more akin to the ACA and re-visiting police funding/training, which I think is where most of America is.
I think there is a silent majority, but it's the socially moderate-left that likes a non-controversial candidate like Biden.  The Sanders/AOC wing and the Trump/McConnell/Graham wing have no popular constituency
Uhhh yeah dude - Biden is actually likable and popular unlike Hillary (literally the only reason she lost).
. knows that we can put long-overdue protections and accountability into law and remove barriers to justice. He knows that women will not stand for silence or complacency anymore. Together, we can ensure every voice will be heard.
Dodd is the distraction. Ignore the old cunt.   The VP pick is still Biden's choice. Keep at it. Let him know. #KamalaHarrisForVP   And if yall have time, go #RegisterToVote2020
this tweet by Joe Biden is an absolute LIE.
AOC is aware of her limitations and would wisely not participate. Would be more embarrassing than a Biden Trump debate.
Experience doesn't outweigh policy, of which Biden's is "Shoot the protesters in the leg instead of the heart" and "No universal healthcare during a pandemic"
Big fucking surprise. The people that support Trump WANT to support Trump, the people that support Biden are forced to, because it's either this fucking used napkin or Stupid Hitler.  Abolish the Electoral College, institute ranked choice voting. Simple.
No way they can steal 73 million votes even with stuffed mail in ballots. Here is the kill shot for Biden...he gets only 60% of the Obama inner city vote from '08. =loss in PA MI. Puts New York and Illinois in play
Live look at Biden walking down a ramp.
All the more reason to vote for Biden.  #Biden2020
I miss reasonable Republicans. I remember what they were like. "Do we really need to spend more money on military when schools need it more?" I specifically remember Republicans arguing that in the 1970s. I'm a Democrat and even wanted Bernie. Biden is a 1970s Republican. Not bad
He's after the name recognition from running once. We have two good senators so he doesn't really want to ruin that perhaps, but he can't get his name out there where it matters buy running for the house. He will be one of the boys Biden mentors
Watch Biden's remarks on how he's mobilizing a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce to deal with the caregiving crisis in our nation.

He only regrets the ones that cause him trouble or don’t garner a reaction. He fires out tweets looking to find a new word, nickname, or catch phrase that he can hang his hat on.  He’s mad cause he can’t find one for Biden.
is this being broadcasted where you live? Public service FYI.
&gt; If you live in the suburbs or you’re a city dweller eyeing a move to a quiet cul-de-sac where your kids can play outside, you need to know about Joe Biden’s plan for a federal takeover of local zoning laws.  What about the ppl who have to drive everyplace and want out of that?
Can't wait for the Biden test
ask Donna B if she’s going to give Biden the Questions at the Debate
One of my greatest fears is a young, charismatic woke movement leader in politics. Something like a Castro or Chavez for this new movement. The stage is already set for just such a figure, and he is not Joe Biden. Our new cultural revolution is leaderless now. Thank God.
Broski, Biden is under investigation for his wrongdoing in Ukraine.....in time it will be great to have him behind bars.....and in given time the other stooges ( Hillary and Obama) will be joining him... tick tick, tick tick there time is almost up

Let’s go             Let’s make this a great weekend for electing  and
Biden uses N word 13 times in a speech and Trump is the racist??? COME ON
One encouraging trend I see  in lots of these polls is that Biden is getting 50% or better support.  Once you hit 50% there is nowhere for your opponent to go.  I'd rather have a 13 point lead of 51-38 than a 13 point lead of 45-32.
Joe Biden will not be the nominee. Hillary's lesbian hit squads and the Bernire Bros butcher each other in a blood bath. Lyin' Lizzie emerges as a compromise nominee to capture a worthless nomination. Trump wins 45 states including NY and CA.
When you haven’t done the reading.
No. You vote for Biden you vote for Fascism. He's directly responsible for Trump. Stop thinking voting blue fixes anything when they just keep moving further right.
Can you imagine a President of the USA who doesn't use fascism to divide and harm us? Can you imagine a leader who starts at empathy? Vote Biden, do not stop, do not pass go. Bring all your friends. #BidenCoalition #FascismInTheUSA #PortlandProtestBiden would lose those 12 votes for sure!
Didn’t vote for Biden in the primary, but no trump really hasn’t done anything tremendous for the economy lol... the banks are literally giving away money to try &amp; make sure trumps bad fiscal policy doesn’t set us behind for another half century
If you didn’t vote in the primaries, you can’t be mad that Biden is the nominee
It sure is! Our President will be Joe Biden.
I believe you, person who tweets for Joe Biden. You take his cell phone and he can play with the life call alert necklace.
I read a really depressing story yesterday about former trump voters who are sticking to him. It was a focus group. Made we worried. Even though there are more of us than them.

It would be funny because during the primaries Biden campaigned on the idea that he was the only one who could beat trump
Listening to VP Joe Biden.....a rational, smart, caring human being....with the experience necessary to get the job done.....gives me hope that there will be real leadership in handling Covid and BLM and future crises. After listening to AG Barr, a Trump lackey...good grief.....

Totally misleading headline. "Won't" isn't "hasn't yet."  "When I focus on turnout, we will deliver Michigan to Joe Biden. Trump only won Michigan by 10,000 votes. When I turn out my folks and my district, we'll be able to take back the state." - Tlaib
You know saying the word minstrel isn't inherently racist. You also know no one in this thread even mentioned Biden until you, she hes living rent free in your brain which is wild.    If you want im sure in 30 seconds on Google I can find pictures of Trump with KKK members too

There's would be a solid partnership and I desperately hope she is Biden's pick. Hopefully they'll announce by this Friday whomever it may end up being. But I'll place my flag firmly that Harris is the best choice for the campaign and for America. End/
To keep that suburbs support firmly in their camp the VP also must reassure them that they are not radical. Harris has distinguished herself from Biden with her earlier attack on him which will be a huge talking point...3/
We are not safe right now I’ll take Biden or anybody over the crazy Trump and his crazy enabler’s.
The attack against Biden by Trump is that he is mentally declining is BS but likely Trump voters I've spoken with believe it, and probably some of his suburbs supporters too. So no matter who the VP nom is they will be forced to combat that narrative...2/
Biden by this point should've picked his running mate and he should've picked Harris. Why? Including her resume she is the best running mate for Biden and she will help get him elected. But it goes deeper...1/
It’s all true but in the meantime until we get Joe Biden how many more people will die how sad and avoidable if we didn’t have Trump.
It's Biden's loss. But really we need Warren to succeed Pelosi as Speaker.
It's sad the options are Orange Twitter Troll, Racist Hair Sniffer, or Beyonces Video Was Better.  Could have ran a flaming bag of shit and beat Trump, instead they went with Biden 😆
Do you think Trump’s electoral advantage is as strong with Biden as an opponent instead of Clinton? IE Biden doing better w white voters?
I'm going to vote for Joe Biden no matter who he picks for his vice president. But I'd be a heck of a lot happier if he picked Sen. Kamala Haris. Who's with me?

Imagine that.  Who would have thought that Joe Biden had these thoughts...
No. 94 crime bill. Written by Biden. Patriot Act. Yeah that was Biden. The democrats have given Trump just about everything he wants. Caging children happened when Biden was VP. The neoliberal capitalists gave us Trump. Biden gave us Trump. Biden is far right.
Biden's not a pedophile.   Just another projection from Trump the sexual predator/rapist/sex trafficker.  #TrumpThreatensAmerica
Biden isn't going to make those changes. He has always been a republic dressed with a D, and for some reason, you believe the democrats are the good guys even though they keep moving further and further right. Biden is a known pathological liar.
The treatment of Bernie and other outsider candidates by the party and their cohorts will drive  many embittered voters to not pull the lever for Biden IMO
It has nothing to do with the "lesser of two evils." Hillary is a democrat. Biden is a democrat. That's reason enough to never vote for either one of them. Democrats are cancer.

Joe Biden essentially announcing that he’s going to implement  excellent Small Business Plan for Black Americans. #WarrenForVP
Biden's short list just got shorter!
I think a lot of the people that have been mentioned as candidates will get a role into the Biden administration
And there's a certain moral authority added to Joe Biden -- who as VP vigorously defended our nation's first black President and ran on restoring the moral authority in the office of the Presidency -- in picking an African-American woman. (2/2)
The Dems have no message, instead Biden is stealing POTUS' message(s). The bring the fear mongers,domestic terrorists:BLM,Antifa hoping to scare Americans in to caving to their demands. They use race baiting,name calling. This is why Trump won&amp;will again!!
First thing I can agree with you on. Biden will win

Magical thinking. Dangerously negligent. BIDEN 2020
By your "logic" Joe Biden should disqualify himself. He's associated with the Catholic Church for years despite it's "clear history of abuse." But hey, have fun tearing down an accomplished black women with a hit piece sourced to a right wing rag founded by Tucker Carlson.
I could continue but I think that's enough.  Really, as a white dude, I remember how much Biden's "restore the soul," his vigorous defense of the Obama legacy, and his "good guy" tonic image to Trump grew on me in the primaries.  It's what got Biden to where he is today.
I live in Mass. I’ve seen project Lincoln commercials and Biden commercials but zero Trump commercials.
Jon, your side was cheated when Bernie didn’t get it. I dislike Bernie’s policies but not him. Seems very affable. Wild as a young Rep, but honest. Very honest. Biden is a freak mannequin bullshit artist. Can’t do it ever.
Did Biden’s team do their due doodoo?  Their ship has been killed tight as shit so far...I have a hard time believing they missed this shit
Heard "9 to 5" on the Biden-Warren call and sighed so heavily that my wife tapped my knee. #WarrenForVP
Biden is sad old dog that wants to sleep all day and pees around the house by accident.
Lololololol.  Biden would have to be left for him to do that. He's far-right.
This dude disgusts me. The fact that settle for Biden is a slogan is so fvcking gross. People like  clearly do not understand why it is we have Trump. Let me tell you. It's Biden.
I think she blew her chances when she attacked Biden during one of the debates. I too believe she wud be great on the ticket but look for Stacey Abrams
Biden's VP will be the female that smells the best. #sniffsniff #biden #sniffer #creep #pedojoe #sniff
Putting the Leftist group she was involved in that went to Cuba in the 70’s aside her endorsement of Scientology is horrifying! Biden can not afford to phuck this up!

absolutely are the parallels between now and late 1920s/early 1930s Germany too on the nose.  Biden is still auth-right.  everyone in this election, and every US election for a century, has been auth-right, except Sanders, maybe Nader, do we get to Teddy for lib-right?
Biden sees Trump's Demon Sperm Doctor, raises him Anti-Xenu VP.
Biden requested early access to briefings, when it was clear trump was doing nothing about the bounties on our soldiers. The national security team has zero reason to withhold anything from the former VP/senator.
Joe Biden’s search for a running mate enters final stretch
What if Biden picks another woman at their recommendation?   Still misogyny?
Why not put a ticker in the corner "Days Joe Biden has refused an interview".  Let's face it the man is senile.  They only let certain reporters ask questions.
People boycott elections all the time. Its called NOT VOTING.  im all for this btw. Makes Biden's margin of victory larger.
If this is what its going to take to A. Make Trump so mad he explodes; B. Convinces some republicans to vote Biden; or C. Properly IDs species Oompa Loompiticus, I'm pleased. #LincolnProject #LincolnProjectEffect #TeamJoe

Biden VP pick: Top choices for a 2020 running mate - POLITICO
I interpreted her 'flame out' as getting an early signal from Biden about his intentions.
I don’t blame Biden..Kamala is someone you don’t want as your subordinate. I will never forget her little girl BS. Pick Val Demmings.
"Evanina (Dir. NCSC) ultimately acknowledged that Russia is again trying to boost President Donald Trump’s reelection and denigrate his opponent, the presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, sources who attended the briefing said."
1. This conversation is about the First Lady. 2. Biden has been concerned about the people of the United States for a lot longer than Twitter has even existed.
The fact of the matter is that this is NOT the time for liberals to be criticizing the Dem candidate. By all means, do so as soon as soon as we take back the white house. But doing anything other than offering full throated support for Biden only serves to help Trump
I think it is important to keeping a Democrat in the WH that Biden tee up his VP to run in 2024. And for that reason he should pick Kamala Harris
Val Demings is high on my list. No VP candidates are perfect. If not VD for Biden’s VP, then certainly for another position in Biden’s Cabinet. Of course I feel similarly about Biden’s other women candidates. They are all intelligent, accomplished, flexible &amp; good women 💛👍🍀🤞
I mean, the pictures of Joe Biden kneeling, with a mask, all sunny around him, outstretching his hands to grace a Black child. It's fuckin' "I'm your savior" propaganda. If he were a little more religiously based, he would probably pass himself off as the second Christ.
once should keep an eye on senate seats in swing states - MT, NC, GA, IA. If GOP thinks it cannot salvage presidency,  may tinker with senate elections (various ways to cheat and other countries can oblige) to keep senate in their control and obstruct any Biden agenda.
Joe Biden is up by 10 in every poll, though. Why would any of his stans ever care about VP, he's a shoo-in!
Rich white &amp; entitled moms like you don’t like the idea of ‘Moms For Biden’ because you are out of touch with middle America &amp; the working class families &amp; their struggles.
Maybe Joe Biden?  Isn’t he getting the briefings now too?
Look, I’m a crazy RWNJ, but  is a good person who served the city the best she could. Her choice to ride with Biden, but this slug is a clown host. #MSNBC #TheBeat
Not to mention “Latinos merecen alguien mejor que Biden” both treats Latinos as a monolithic bloc - sounds kinda like the “identity politics” they’re always railing against, no? - and also implies the race-baiting, xenophobic President is a better option... huh??
Biden has backed Senator Elizabeth Warren’s call to immediately cancel at least $10,000 of student debt per person. Learn more:  #HigherEd #EdChat
As I’ve said before, the debate kerfuffle was always going to be the toughest issue to get over, but she is still going to be the VP candidate.  No one else seems plausible, IMHO.
She is a republican. Don’t spread her trash and let Biden  make his choice..all the women are top notch.
If Biden does this, Trump would laugh. The race would be over.
Please listen to the audio

If Biden's VP pick is suppose to succeed him as the next President, it should probably be someone Democrats already want to be President like Warren or Harris. If most voters will need to be introduced to the VP like Tim Kaine was, it's a missed opportunity for Biden.

In terms of the voting blocs in the recent primary, I think Markey will get all of Sanders, much of Warren, and some of Biden. Kennedy will get much of Biden, some of Warren, and none of Sanders. I like Ed’s chances.
I will be draining the swamp by voting for Biden. You are one of the worst U.S. presidents to sit in the oval office. The only Americans you have helped are your rich friends. We are voting you out in November!
I've decided that Harris would be the dumbest possible VP pick, because the only ones it would please are people like this guy, who can't even JOKE about making demands of Biden without adding a disclaimer assuring the reader that he didn't really mean it and will do as told
I'm black so i've never gotten a sunburn but I have to imagine rectal cancer is worse lol  I'm rooting for Barbara Lee, but Karen Bass will at least get me to not root against a Biden ticket
Same, Bass gets me to not root against Biden Barbara Lee gets me to root for a Biden ticket  Everyone else gets me to root against a biden ticket &amp; root for greens
I wish it were sooner too so this world can get back to normal. By the way, Trump is going to wipe the streets with Biden. Epic win...
2/ Are you telling me Bob Dole was not too ambitious in 1976?  Did GHW Bush express regret for "voodoo economics" in 1980?  What about Al Gore in 1992? Did he not have his eyes on the White House?  Jack Kemp in 1996?  John Edwards in 2004?  Heck, Biden lambased Obama in 2007-08.
Well, I was talking about Biden's team here, not the press.
I think you’re right  Trumps people will vote in person  Biden’s will vote by mail  But what does it all mean 🤣😂

“As the US death toll has now reached 152,075 and there are almost 4.5 million confirmed cases in the nation, [Hearing Chairman] Clyburn said the level of death and hospitalizations is “unacceptable”.”

“public health officials and senior US lawmakers are sounding alarms about the Trump administration’s lack of planning for its nationwide distribution.”
Chip in to elect Joe Biden
Wait did you all really push for Biden without having ever heard of him before?
The Biden administration will have a lot to do.
That’s an asinine headline. Is Trump’s version what “really running” looks like?
Yep. When the Dems picked Biden I was like you have got to be fucking kidding me, we’re going to end up with 4 more years of Donald fucking Trump, aren’t we.
I’m not speaking to it’s quality, just the drop for Biden is interesting and noteworthy.  Also I’m out on 538, their analyses in 2016 were awful (not necessarily their fault).

Aka slime creature lobbyists are pissed because if Biden dies in office she will be potus and not cater to them. They’re very predictable. Old white dudes should retire this year. Go away. You’re wittingly and unwittingly destroying this country
Just a reminder to the many Trump supporters who say they won't accept the results if Biden wins... That is NOT up for debate. So build a bridge and get over it!!!
Polling among all age groups also finds strong opposition to abortion without restriction up to birth and taxpayer-funded abortions — the position that Biden now holds.
Joe Biden is struggling to reach religious voters. It’s hardly a surprise. Biden is a pro-abortion Democrat who opposes religious freedom – even for nuns — and wants to force taxpayers to pay for abortions.
`That was my first thought but you know, if you don’t vote, you don’t vote. If Biden wins, I’m fine with them sitting around the trailer park, crowing about how Trump would have won if...   Works for me.
Cuomo and Newsom have independently bungled their state responses why wouldn't Biden bungle the national response
I’ve basically been saying this whole time that trump may be the ONE republican Biden could actually beat.  If the republicans somehow fielded Romney this year there would be absolutely no chance.

That awkward moment when you’re in such pure shock from reading the words “Joe Biden” and “further left” in the same sentence that you don’t even finish reading the sentence correctly
“Joe Biden is further left than Bernie Sanders” is certainly a take
He said  “she’s 12 I’ve never been into that”
Kamala Harris has now answered these attacks, but Biden hasn’t.  Not a good look.
There are so many women who are prepared, experienced, highly capable, to lead this country and be potus. I’m not sure why you demand anything like this. I’m sure Biden knows his choice is important if something happens to him. Younger ppl die. JFK, Bobby Kennedy were murdered.
Bernie Sanders and AOC are already on record supporting this maggot's right to vote. Does their marionette, Joe Biden, agree? Better question: Will he ever be asked?
Yup. And ironically their solution is Joe “You know, the thing” Biden.
A 17-year-old is among three people behind the high-profile Twitter hack earlier this month that targeted a range of people, including Joe Biden and Bill Gates, according to Florida officials.

"Joe Biden is far to the left of Bernie Sanders" might be the most ludicrous thing Donald Trump has said all day so far.
As usual, Trump supporters find ways to attack Biden, but never have a single positive Trump accomplishment to talk about. That's because there are none.
The video presentation during the Barr bearings prompted rhis no doubt. The democrats hate to see their agenda foiled by somerhing like video proof. The democrats had the same reaction when Biden was seen on video bragging about his quid pro quo violation.

Brown didnt “severely hamper” anything. He was notable only for having one time been a centerfold. He didnt do anything particularly controvesial and cast no swing votes.  The ACA was “hampered” by scared centrists that Biden as VP was able to push over the line.
Republicans want a stimulus extension of $1T. Democrats want more than $3T. If Biden is elected, and the Dems get control of both the Upper and Lower houses, get ready for extreme fiscal imprudence, and consequently, the implosion of the USD.
Joe Biden is president?
NYT article predicts Representative Karen Bass for VP, and explains why. If Joe thinks so, sounds good to me  😃
Hi, as an actual Mass resident, I can tell you it is 100% safe. The seat can be filled on Nov 3, and Brown was the first R senator in MA since the 1970’s.  I notice you say “almost” quite a lot as while ignoring it DID happen, in part bc VP Biden was whipping votes.
A lot of people don’t know much about Kaine.  He was an Obama guy.  Mayor of Richmond, Governor of Virginia, Senator of Virginia.  Hardly an unambitious loyalist.  But it’s whatever.  Biden is already the Tim Kaine figure.
Things f'ing exploded all right, and we still wanted Biden over Bernie four years later. I'll never forgive you,
Where is it taking place? How many people can social distance in Biden's basement?
I’m counting the days until Biden pardons the entire Trump administration, and the entire MSM publicly orgasms like Sally in “When Harry Met Sally,” except they won’t be faking it.

They will manufacture “dirt” &amp; intentionally mislead. Barr will hold a press conf to deliver the msg they want. That will flood social media. Look at the crap abt Benghazi even after all the investigatns. The goal is to sway trump voters leaning twd Biden. If they’re still alive.
They know NUNES, GRAHAM, GRASSLEY and others received such packages of smut about Biden purportedly to make up will be used to create the"OCTOBER SURPRISE"leading Republicans are openly discussing,which means it's going to be underwhelming in impact but full of bullshit inuendo!
I'd like to co-sign as a white woman. The coverage of VP Biden's potential running mates is infuriating, particularly in the wake of 2016. Advisors/donors who are speaking &amp; leaking are hurting JB. They're not on his side, nor the country's. They're self-interested.
In his Biden interview, Ady Barkan reflected on the nominee's proposed budget for the NIH stating simply "I don't think that's enough." Watching him always moves me, but Ady having found in  someone whose "optimism and perseverance" ARE enough nearly brought me to tears.

So bad....I’ve tried to see things from the other side and I just can’t figure out their thought process. Bottom line is that they will do anything and everything to get him out of office. If he is voted back in, it will be 4 more years of the same. And Biden? God help us.

When Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 her staff went to high level jobs at Apple, Google, Twitter, and Facebook.  Think that explains why tech stocks moved the NASDAQ to  all time highs, why Apple is now the most valuable company (over a Trillion) in the world, &amp; why Biden may win?
Disagree.  I think Klobuchar, Bullock, Bennet, etc. would have been fine as far as ideology.  But none have strong connections w/ the African-American community.  And none have the moral authority of the Obama administration nor the biography of Joe Biden.
Biden’s wife should be charged with Elder abuse!!!
They can all go to hell, especially after Clinton having 3 million more votes in 2016. They inflicted this 4-year trauma on all of us, let them stew in their own paranoid delusions for the next 4-years while Biden and Democrats get shit done.
YES!!!!! If this is indeed the case I don’t think we’ll be seeing Donnie hanging around. He hates Joe Biden but he DEESSPIISES Nancy Pelosi.
Suddenly I’m less hopefully about the Veepstakes and feel so deflated.   Kamala has been working her ass off for Biden and to see her potentially derailed by weak white men threatened by her ambition is awful.    and  showed the type of people they are.
Not close to excited. I thought for sure Kamala now I am back to thinking Liz Warren give the very public bashing Kamala got from people close to Biden this week
But I feel like if you have to explain that I knew her at 12 and she was so “beautiful” (not pretty like most 12 yos are described) He was struck by it then say but when she turned 25... wink wink - still pervy
I agree with this. If I’m Biden I’m going with Harris and if not Harris then Duckworth. No reason to overthink it.   I love Warren but with things going the way they are (big lead, national pandemic) there’s no reason to give Trump &amp; his team such an obvious target / distraction
Trump administration does not even have to have chart every day Obama Biden during the swine clue refused to report cases because they said it was a pandemic and people where going to Die!!! Trump can even stop mass ted
Is this the right wing version of a vote for a spoiler is a vote for Trump (in this case Biden)?
Yes, this.  I mean I’m reading this articles and it’s like Biden is looking for a very quiet loyalist?🤔
and this is on top of all the voter suppression that Democrats let Republicans get away with uncontested because it helped Biden win the primary
So you're saying people can get free healthcare and still hate brown people? if you're planning on giving the South to Biden in November this is a good start
We should expect the Russian, and I include the Republicans as Russians for this purpose, trolling to attack Biden from the left more than from the right. Does anyone know who paid for the ad?
Free legal advice, first one to start snacking does not die in federal prison. I suggest you get to Biden's attorney general and make a deal before Devin Nunes does

Thank you for all you do.  We get it &amp; we can’t let up.  And now we learn 👉🏼NUNES was sent info frm a pro-Russia source in Ukraine.  👉🏼 Trump wanted “dirt” on Biden 2release b4 election. He got impeached for that...GOP doesn’t care. They’re STILL soliciting foreign election help.
: WAIT A MINUTE ... Do you mean to tell us that you DID have a plan?!?  You mean that the Obama/Biden administration actually DID LEAVE YOU A PLAN?!?  And you threw it away??????  YOU ALL OWN EVERY ONE OF THE 150,000+ AMERICAN DEATHS!  *
JFC, at least people know who Kamala Harris is. Karen Bass has no name recognition outside her district and the beltway. Meanwhile both of these women are from a California, a state Biden will win easily.  I’m so disappointed that Stacey Abrams isn’t being talked about now.
Good, she should rub everyone the wrong way. Nobody gets to anyone without friction. And they're so worried about what she is capable of, it's beyond transparent
Trump makes me more excited about voting for Biden than Biden does.

If one of y’all share another fucking post about how not voting for Joe Biden is a vote for Trump, I am going to lose my fucking mind
Add prescience to Biden's qualities.
either option is shitty for Biden. Just like how this entire process has unfolded in the last 2-3 weeks. This all could have been much better. If he wanted it to...
are these series of Kamala is the reincarnation of the devil leaks from old white men a result of Biden already having told them she is the pick? And they dont like it?  Or Biden testing the waters to see if any of these slanders stick, thereby not selecting Kamala.
Please watch the video to see how those vampires siezed on a Biden’s prediction. Now they’re  eating their words.
I'm getting really tired of reading "Biden is trash too". I get it; he's not Bernie. Now shut up and eat your veggies
Trump administration honestly said that it was gonna be awful if Biden takes off it will be worse
trump supporters: 👩‍🦯
Not to mention, I make comments like this and not a single reply from Biden's social media team. It is as if they are using Twitter to lecture instead of engage with their audience – which is the purpose of the platform.
I do not plan to vote for Trump. As a marketer, Biden's marketing is just so horrible. None of his social appears remotely close to his own voice. And Marketing 101 is not to mention your competition – it just amplifies their voice. Worried about Biden's ability to communicate.
boy you aren't kidding. I have been noticing that they have been actively campaigning harder against Biden than actual Trumpers. Very "progressive" of them.
There’s been like 10 hit pieces.  People are gunning for Harris, and only Biden can put a stop to that.
honestly didn’t give enough credit to people’s ability to see right through JK3 so this is a nice recovery from the nihilism I got from watching puppets dragging Biden across the finish line
Thought we were talking about Biden&amp;Trump here. Calling it for what it is...is not hateful. Keeping quiet on Dems unending relentless pursuit to get rid ofTrump ever since he stepped into office &amp;yet pretending to be the victims when conservatives fight back. Don’t instigate then
When Joe Biden’s probably a rapist, not to mention a serial molester, the Democrats will have the rare distinction of electing an immoral pervert for President.  They always aspire to be the first idiots in every way...
I really don’t think most voters will care about that. Plus I don’t think her Castro comments are that bad and even still Biden’s the top of the ticket and is clearly doing well in Florida.   Also Kamala living in Canada for years is a vulnerability that hasn’t been tapped yet.
When Joe Biden’s probably a rapist, not to mention a serial molester, the Democrats will have the rare distinction of electing an immoral pervert for President.  They always aspire to be the first idiots in every way...
Biden isn't in the video. You'd think a presidential candidate would share his presidential action plans instead of running on the platform: The current president stinks.
I think the media is the one dragging this out. He already said months ago that he would make his decision in early August. They've been covering potential picks nonstop since Bernie dropped out of the race. I don't think that's Biden's fault. My 2 cents.
They're for anything that is corrupt! You would have to be brain dead to vote DemonRat.  Unless you want all your cities to a lawless jungle. If Demonrat voters could take a glimpse into the future if Biden was elected, they would regret it every day that they lived. 💯%FACT!!
Look at most recent CNBC poll.  Biden’s leads in battleground states have evaporated in ~1 week.  This election season has barely even started.

Bernie couldn’t have been more explicit that he would sheepdog for the eventual winner again, and he’s doing it avidly. But if Biden manages to lose, the Dem chorus will be “Bernie did nothing to help Biden and his toxic Bros love Trump,” not that it matters.
The July 15 attack compromised the accounts of some of its most high profile users, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk and former Vice President Joe Biden.
I saw Bernie as a worthwhile compromise with some chance of getting elected. His sheepdogging history preceded him but is now more flagrant than ever. Mostly I’m seeing Berners not following him into active support for Biden.
Listening to covid19 hearings, it seems to me that, 1. Trump denied covid19 when it mattered most 2. Trump failed to listen to experts 3. Trump held unsafe rallies, Hermain Cain died 4. Trump has no plan.  5. Trump has killed 153,000 plus Americans.

Oh they don’t care what Biden does or did lol they just want Trump out lol..it quite sad actually wanting a pedo in there because you hate the President so much
is a blatant admission there’s no positive case for biden, and as i’ve shown, there’s barely a negative one if you compare him to trump honestly  why don’t you fuck off and do something useful
Biden would forgive all undergraduate “tuition-related” student debt for borrowers who earn less than $125,000 a year and attended public community colleges or four-year institutions.

This article is basically telephone in written form. None of the "sources" are remotely close to Biden or know what he's going to do, but you media folks will continue to push anyone but Warren for VP
I guess you could say I’m a Trump hating Biden hater.
My feelings about Biden weren’t clear from “F your tweets?” The man is literally incapable of giving the public anything more than “Trump sucks, I’d be better.”
Fuck Biden too tho
It’s Ann Jones
which millions  you can’t even stand strong on the narrow-ass plank of you’ve put yourself on  biden’s inactions are likely to be worse than his actions, and you still can’t make a decent case
* may or may not be a bigger racist  also Bloomberg, Kerry, and Larry Summers are Epstein guys on Biden’s staff so you’re not outta the woods there either
Actually  Trump v Biden is:  Russia v America
The numbers show it: Biden is winning the presidential race by not really running
These outstanding individuals would have profited more if their father was NOT President. You are projecting Killary and Biden's crimes . Nice try. Won't work.
i’m saying biden’s health care policy is a sham, his immigration/policing policies will be the same or worse, his foreign policy is likely to need much worse, and there’s a chance he gets real cuts to the social safety net that the republican party doesn’t seem as interested in
Who needs logic, right? If you don’t think Biden’s Administration would work with a variety of departments and organizations (especially regarding science, economics, etc) to improve public health and return Americans to the work place, you must not think before you speak.
hi i’d rather be phonebanking for one of Susan Collins’ challengers or Biden but here i am
Oh I agree. I joined a pro trump fb page that my trumptard bro follows, just to spy. They are telling people to say they are voting for Biden in the polls so that D’s will believe it’s a huge margin and the fear of corona will make people think it’s ok to stay home in November 3!
fuck ‘party unity’, fuck the  fuck the two party system, fuck corporate money in politics, fuck any policy that does not focus on lifting up working citizens living in this hell hole country. burn it all down fam. and fuck people who don’t like cats.
I'm no fan of Biden, but bitter #NeverBiden dead-enders are no better than Dems whose entire politics are based only on opposing Trump.  The left's hope for national-level power died on Super Tuesday. Gotta let it go and focus on base-building: unions, tenant organizing, locals
So let's use a little bit of basic logic.   A Republican told me that "unless you vote for the Republican nominee, you're voting for Joe Biden."  Which one of you is wrong?  Let me help: BOTH of you are.  Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.  👋🏾
Aren’t we at an 11% unemployment rate? Obama and Biden were at 4.7% when they handed it over to Trump and he screwed it all up.

oh boy the other corrupt party that uses victims for votes!  all the crime cesspools and police problems are in longtime blue cities.  And Biden has helped no one in 50yrs and touches kids.  but yay for your feelings!
when is joe biden?
On election night, even if many votes are not yet counted, we'll still know that you lost the election.  Biden will win by a landslide.  Intelligent Americans are fed up with having an incompetent criminal in the White House.
I thought Biden was going to sell Utah to the Chinese, and replace the Lincoln memorial with a 90 ft statue of Ho Chi Minh?
Word? You think having 4 of the other candidates immediately side with Biden after falling out WASNT significant or having the DNC pratically disown Bernie to upkept the democratic “ideology”, they wanted...it’s always deeper than just the surface and YOU KNOW THAT
Calling me a racist,  while supporting a racist (Biden)   That’s rich 😂😂. Pot meet kettle

I understand completely. And I agree. But if they are going to vote for Biden, we'll take those votes.
Me naive. Yeah ok . In 1977 Biden said integrating black students would turn schools into jungles.Biden helped sign the 1994 crime bill that incarcerated thousands of black men.  Ironically Trumps prison reform freed some of the black men Biden incarcerated.
If Biden was the president through this, the infection and death rate would be astronomical.  Biden stated that he wouldn't have stopped travel from china to america, then went on to criticize the sitting President.  Biden has a long history of bad judgments, 40+ yrs!

You wanna talk about politicians dragging their feet? If you all happen to succeed in voting in Biden, watch how fast the Democrats feet will drag on any issue. They’ll let you shout in the streets but change nothing.
Whats in it?
And Biden is better? Please stop using drugs if that's what you think. The economy has never been better than under Trump. At least he's doing things that actually help the American people, unlike all these Presidents there's been before him that did nothing to help any of us.😒
Many people are looking extra closely at this VP pick due to the fact that Biden will probably not seek a second term if elected. There’s a very good chance that his VP will succeed him as president
What does this mean?
And Biden’s going to destroy America?
It’s plausible Biden will do more for reform &amp; racial tensions than Trump, who has more than sold out to his base who sees not much wrong with enforcement as is. But if he can also listen to experts in many fields on how to get people back to work safely, employment ⬆️ protest ⬇️
So  is going to do what the cry baby Democrats have done for 4 years now!? Except last election wasn’t rigged. The only challenge Joe Biden would be facing is trying to put together a full sentence without forgetting where he is. You must be as delusional as him.

One of the main issues now is that federal agents are going after protestors &amp; not just rioters. You could argue it’s just the media perception distributing that, but we’d probably both agree then that the perception would shift when Biden was elected. Biden’s a good corporatist.
Yeah, I agree. I deleted it and then put it back as I was writing the tweet. Its also why my in-laws say is their biggest hold up to voting for Biden
normally id say biden should be saying what his plan would be but the fucked up thing is _everyone knows how to beat this_ just wear masks and stay home
To be fair, Biden probably thought “targeting Muslims” would just mean bombs and sanctions.
This is bad. It gives Trump even the weakest leg to stand on. (And don’t think he’ll be bothered by the contradiction of using this while smearing Biden with China.)
I don’t know if your opinion is rooted in fact.  One stance I could take is how Biden vs. Trump would handle the pandemic. If Biden’s admin can quell the virus better than Trump &amp; get people back to work life safely faster than Trump can, unemployment resolved faster &gt; less riots
When I said it, I meant stuff like Medicare for all, abolishing police, getting rid of the electoral college or a wealth tax. Stuff talked about in the primary that Republicans give when they say they can't vote for Biden

This whole article is disgusting, even apart from the “let blue states die” nugget... this is why IT MATTERS WHO THE PRESIDENT IS. If you’re still refusing to hold your nose and vote for Biden, you are condemning more Americans to die.
As Joe Biden prepares to announce his running mate, he's under a lot of pressure to pick a woman of color. Even so, Elizabeth Warren is believed to be among the top contenders and already exerting a big influence on Biden's campaign:
A month ago, Biden committed to the 3 planned debates. Trump has not committed because he’s insisting on date changes, new moderators, etc. Look it up.
If &amp; when Biden wins and absolutely nothing changes or gets better, I think then the floodgates could open

biden can’t even get 20 people to watch his live-streams. Brainwashed liberal.
When Biden was VP the economy started as one of the worst it had ever been, by the end of that time it was thriving stronger than ever before   Trump is best known for telling people they’re fired.
1. You are lying.  2. 150k Americans didn’t die from a deadly virus due to incompetence under Biden’s watch.  Do you really want to go there?
And based on what's reported it wasn't just a one off praise for Castro. a state that's decided by a point or two she is a very risky choice and Biden would be a fool to pick her. FL being called at 8pm on Nov 3rd for Biden is the ball game.
Just seeing his face makes me cringe. Disgusting old man. Anyone going to charge him?
Sure Biden spent a lifetime rubber stamping and cheerleading all our wars for oil, as well as making sure Delaware remained a tax haven money laundering center for oligarchs national and global, but I'm sure he's serious about solving the problem!
Hillary was up by 2-3 points on average in polls at this point. Biden is up 8-10 points.  I despise Biden and will not be voting for him, but it's a near certainty that he wins.
Well, I suppose you think the deaths of 150,000 people, tanking the economy and allowing Russia to put bounties on American troops is a good start?  You're insane.  Biden is great guy, public servant, father and husband.  Pumpkinhead is an all around disgusting creep.

Joe Biden, to oppose Trump, is the precisely crafted creation of the nation's lesserevilologists.  As always, surprisingly little hangs on their expertise.
Remember when all those Fox News folks expressed their withering incredulity at Joe Biden’s suggestion that  might try to “delay” the November election?  Ahh...yeah...good times
Joe Biden couldn’t, thats for sure
Weird. Bc when Biden was VP they started with 11% unemployment and brought it down to 4%... seems like a lot of jobs to me.
Did Biden know FDR?
But what happens when a 60 year old man without a high school education reads a Trump ad saying Biden works for Bin Laden? Trusting people to “decide for themselves” is dangerous.
Did yo know? Biden has promised to make up to two years of community college free for all students. He’s also “endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders’ original proposal to make public colleges and universities free for families earning below $125,000 a year.”

True.  Still, we need to beat Trump in November and, therefore, we need all the votes for Biden that we can get.
The most viewed video on Joe Biden's YouTube channel is his endorsement from Obama, but none of the other videos even approach the same numbers. The likes vs. dislikes is 60/40. Also worth noting that comments are disabled. Wonder why.

I’m talking about the ones who have openly stated that they will vote for Biden. Have you seen the Republican Voters Against Trump ads?
So do you want them to vote for Biden or not?
I understand the anger &amp; frustration. But I figure that when prominent Republicans take a public stand against Trump, they can influence some other moderate Republicans to vote for Biden. We need those votes.
When Republicans denounce Trump and come out in support of Biden, is it really necessary for people on the left to insult them with taunts of “what took you so long” or “but you were ok with X, Y, Z”?  We are quite literally fighting for the future of our country now.
Biden eulogized Byrd not so long ago.
The important thing right now is to get Trump out of office and the only way to do that is to vote for Biden. Voting anyone else would be foolish as it would guarantee Trump’s re-election. Political issues are secondary and they can be debated and negotiated once Trump is gone.

MAKE NO MISTAKE: The ONLY reason Trump suggested delaying the election is because he and his core supporters are ALREADY planning to NOT accept the legitimacy of Biden's election. They are laying the groundwork for what will amount to a coup against the heart of our democracy.
Soros made his billions by shorting economies, like he did with the Bank of England and like what he's counting on in the US w/ a Biden win.  George Soros is the devil incarnate.  He is pure greed, he only cares about his god, money, despite it destroying the lives of millions.
First the radicals will come for the most visible free thinkers  A Biden win ensures we're next, those critical of the mob  We know the chances we're taking  What will it take to wake up moderate D's so they see a future w/ Trump is Eden compared to what comes w/ Biden?
And yet, if we don't vote for Biden, we will be held responsible for electing Trump. #VoteGreenParty
Washington, DC is full of Pedophiles. But Instead of them going to jail, the sheep idioloze them &amp; vote them into office? Why is that?  Untouchable Pedophiles who sex traffick most of the 2000 kids that go missing daily in the U.S. And even become Presidents like Obama &amp; Biden.🤮

Kind of like Joe Biden?
Biden can’t even criticize or denounce anti-American ANTIFA riots in DemoKKKrat controlled cities. 🙄
Biden was with Obama for eight years. Their Administration took our Country on a hard left turn. 🙄
You overestimate Biden. it’s gonna be like 2016 again except you dropped out early and are supporting a man that can’t complete a coherent sentence. Yes Hillary is evil but at least she’s an evil genius.
He HAS done his most basic financial trail research, leading BLM to funding Biden by the millions....right?🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️  We need to desperately reassess the standards of just who we allow to attend college anymore.....

There is only one round. It’s called an election. If you want to call mourning the death of his son, a veteran, from cancer a “nap”, enjoy looking at yourself in the mirror. And I don’t even LIKE joe Biden!! (Voting for him anyway, bc he ain’t trump.)
1) Hypothesis: Trump purposely let Covid19 rage through the country as his insurance policy for the election or non-election.  Evidence: Before Biden declared Trump was working with his minions to get foreign help to damage Joe. That’s fear &amp; an admittance of Trumps weak chances.
Biden needs to appoint someone to run this Dept with the express task of dismantling it.
I don’t think Trump is a socialist or a communist.  I think he is actually a fascist.  Biden is an American and a patriot.
You do realize the American Muslim community used to be a solid reliable voting Bloc for the Republicans. If Donald Trump wants to chase away Republican voters Joe Biden his happy to get them to vote for him.

According to Turley, Biden saying that Trump is going to try to delay the election and Trump saying that he is going to delay the election equally fuel conspiracy theories about Trump trying to delay the election.
It is true, otherwise Michelle Obama would be Joe Biden’s running mate. Then the World would know that Michelle is really Michael a dude!
Two questions.... Is Biden dragging out the VP nom or does it normally take this long?  Secondly, if he is dragging this out, why? Seems like a pretty divisive thing to do.
The Biden who called Obama "clean"?   He MUST pick from two New Jim Crow prosecutors (not a "meme," a fact); a few unknowns; and war criminal #SusanRiceUnmasked of Obama-Biden &amp; Clinton wars?
The undermining the postal services is now happening and it could demoralized the USA post office and hurt the innocent voters in mailing the ballots. Please vote in person and fo it early screw the post office until President joe Biden comes in
not that I thought it was likely that biden would get anarchist votes, he certainly isn't going to now. People tend not to like being told in advance they would be arrested for having opinions.
Bill Clinton is four years younger than Joe Biden. (This is true now, but I suppose it has always been true?)

You're a fake.  Biden is a great man husband and father who has dedicated his life to public service.  What has your candidate done?  And, for whom?
Biden or his handlers recognize that Biden is a liability, so they’re doing the rope-a-dope of keeping him under wraps as much as possible while Trump burns himself down.

I'm also probably no longer considered a Republican (unless it's a Massachusetts one, aka RINO), and though I'm not a Democrat, I will 100% be voting for Biden in November. That's on the GOP the last few years, I want nothing to do with them anymore.

There will be less rioting  Most of the rioting is happenin from the police anyway. I’m half kiddin, but let’s call tear gassing protestors the fed’s version of “rioting.”  All Biden needs is to people back to working again, &amp; to do even moderate police reform. Workers don’t riot
Then you can't vote for Biden
If people want more of Pelosi SCHIFF NADLER AND THE REST LIKE THE SQUAD VOTE BIDEN, USE YOUR HEADS PEOPLE VOTE REPUBLICANS ACROSS THE BOARD OR WERE IN DEEP TROUBLE.
I’m not sure that divide even works. The GOP would support, say, Biden waging war with Iran or cutting Social Security, while whining that it’s too little, too late.
Mitch McConnell decided the Senate worked so hard this week, they don’t have to come back until Monday. I hope the Democrats-who would have kept working-volunteer at food banks, talk to postal workers, show up at protests, &amp; campaign for Joe Biden and Dem House candidates.
Like they need a colonoscopy through their nose.  Vote Biden.
He was our biggest mistake. If Biden/Rice win the election American life as we know it will be destroyed.

He’s already doing it. A tight 20-minute Rally speech at Texas Oil.  High energy. Concise.  I don’t know about August, but whoever gets the earlier start sets the table. I suspect Biden will drop his VP this week(?) and start the engines for, as the kids say, realsies.  Buckle up

If you're voting for biden you're telling each of the over 500K victims of the iraq, &amp; libya wars their lives are worth a pittance of the value of keeping countries on the Petrodollar racket  You'd be voting for unparalleled imperialism which is why Neocons fled Trump For Biden

Historians and experts who have been studying Trump and Trumpism indicate trump is a dog that barks but never bites. Trump usually settles his cases out of courts. Trump again suggests that mail-in ballots will lead to litigation for a year. Trump will not use elections to plea.
He isn’t going to lose. His opponents on TV all look physically ill. Every blue city is now a dump &amp; all the Mayors pretend it is ok. Biden has dementia.

How does it make you feel as a black woman that Joe Biden is picking a VP based on the color of her skin and what’s between her legs. I find this to be racist, sexist and degrading to all women. Why does it have to be a black woman? Why couldn’t he just say a qualified woman?

You're the one who's memory-holing the fact that Biden was well ahead of them after SC, and tied with Bernie for the lead.
Pete and Amy we're both behind in delegates after SC because Biden's win there was big enough to put him in the lead. That's what happens when you have a contest that in a large state with voters that look like the Democratic coalition instead of tiny white ones.
Even if you hate Trump, look back at Biden’s past runs for the presidencey. He couldn’t get his facts straight then, so how is he fit to be president now.

I’m both excited and terrified by the prospect that on Jan. 21st, Biden and his team are going to stroll into the White House with a collective, “Ahhhh now where were we?”
His police reform stance is also something I agree with, consisting of improving training and requirements to become a police officer rather than defunding or abolishing, though Biden has suggested he would want to allocate some funds away.
If Biden wins, I cannot wait for January 21st when COVID and the economic depression are all Biden's fault. And people will believe it.
before covid trump in a slam dunk, now almost certainly biden
Biden has a pretty progressive climate change plan, aiming to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. He wants a public option healthcare system, which is vastly better than what we have now. He wants a substantial expansion of the welfare state, providing low-income housing.

His deregulation was a direct cause of the 08 crash. Not to mention Biden 94 crime bill he signed into law that has lead to the mass incarceration of POC.
That's why I mentioned how consistent Biden's lead has been. It certainly still possible a very large number of people *could* change their minds after being set on dumping Trump for the past two years, but it's getting increasingly unlikely.
All Trump needs is a handful of sycophant Govs to delay their elections to sow chaos, and manufacture a crisis.  Imagine GA, FL, NC, AZ  all postpone, and Biden gets to 267 electoral votes on Nov 3.

The nightmare scenario is it taking forever to know the results "if it's close" but Biden has had a large lead ever since they started polling the race and the current ones have him leading by double digits. Chickens/eggs/hatched but that's a recipe for an early night.
Its will be such a huge Biden win, you’ll know.  Maybe early.  Did you hear Obama’s eulogy of John Lewis? He was magnificent.  So was Clinton and Bush. Jimmy Carter sent his wishes. You would have really been out of place with all that emotion and intellect. Good you stayed home
Biden's running during an escalation of deaths due to intentionally mismanaged COVID policy. Heard nothing fr Biden to address it, except an adamant refusal to implement &amp; support M4A. This man is unfit on every level, choosing health  industry profit over protecting human lives.
I’m Riding with Biden. You’ll be in for a big surprise.
thats not at all how people work and the belief that it is is why so many people will continue to suffer if biden is elected. fascism will not be stopped it will be paused, and either people like you get that or we are all fucked.
you never asked me. it's inaction health insurance, inaction on climate change, and active malignance at the border and overseas  biden is less bad than trump at some of those, worse at others. negative for all of them.
Democrats want strong borders?  You serious?  Every time he closes an immigration loophole they call it racist.  Also Biden has Beto O’Rourke crafting a gun seizure plan.
Vote for Biden.
I think there will be a huge difference. For example, Biden will appoint people who actually know what they're doing and aren't trying to destroy their own departments. Look at what Trump's done to EPA and Dept. of Ed.

It'll be very interesting to see what all of these Trump supporters who believe that Biden is senile say after they see a head-to-head debate. I wouldn't be surprised if Trump refuses to participate.
The brand of neoliberalism Biden and friends represents would like you to think that it stands for progress and opposition against Republicans but it is actually a distraction to keep people placated during the gradual slide into fascism which dems have done NOTHING to prevent
Did you know? Biden is promising to triple funding for Title I to $45 billion per year, increase federal outlays for IDEA, and double the number of “psychologists, guidance counselors, nurses, social workers, and other health professionals” in schools.
It's as if Joe BIden wasn't VP 4 years ago...
We’ve read “1984”, but didn’t read this new chapter below in the latest edition.
Real vets don’t support Trump, so you’re either a poser or an idiot. Either way you’ll owe me 3 grand in November when Biden wins.
You're telling me that Biden has to tolerate the various sub-goblins and fifth columnists Barr has salted all through the Justice Department? No. There needs to be a cleansing fire first, before we even get to th question of a reckoning. And a reckoning is necessary, it just is.
I love and respect Kamala Harris.  Biden clearly loves and respects Kamala Harris.  This sh*t needs to stop.
I can guarantee you most neolibs smoked cannabis yet they do not look enough into the policy of the candidate whose boots they lick to realize that Biden has built his career off of further criminalizing the plant
Alright biden production team go make the commercial, avoid planes or mountains at all cost
Like these people actually think police brutality is going to stop if we elect Biden? I can’t tell if it’s that or if they know that it’s going to worsen/continue and they don’t care because they don’t view Black people as people
kind of astounded that liberals are so scared to engage in actual politics that they’ve spent the last six months talking about Trump versus Biden, but at the same time I am not at all surprised
Ed Markey has the same history was Biden on abortion rights, bussing, criminal justice.  It’s nothing personal.  It’s generational.
Biden will make the right choice...
Biden's crushing nothing but his pudding container.
Sure, until he made it into a political rally for biden. Most reasonable people would say that it was inappropriate for him to do that.
Totally agree. I love Warren as my senator and hope that she can stay in the Senate continuing to create pressure from the left. Her roll on the Senate will be vital to keep Biden from moderating too much.
Trump Mocked For Saying Biden Aims To Reach Net-Zero Emissions For Buildings By '2:30'    What was that you were saying about Joe not being all there?  Demon Sperm
I bet you Joe Biden can sniff her out!  LOL
When you lose the election this November all of the Constitutional rights afforded to you as the President will end. Then President Joe Biden's Attorney General will have drawn up arrest warrants for you, and anyone else in violation of the law.

I don't agree with that. But I also believe that mail in voting opens the door to to many fraud issues! For instance,if someone votes Trump,before it's counted some could easily mark it for Biden making that voting ballet void!Nevermind being lost in the mail!
By me making a comment about how much Biden sucks doesn’t take away from how much Trump fucking sucks
Yes it will be delayed and Biden won’t notice
Before anyone can say, oh it’s bc of socially distancing, there’s still plenty of room to stay a safe distance from others   This is pathetic and obvious people could care less what Biden says they were scared and brainwashed into voting for him
If impeached  were to be elected it would be dangerous to our beloved nation. Please register and vote for Biden.  Biden cares about your income, housing and healthcare.   doesn't!!
It's going to be so glorious when he gets to stay four more years.  I mean, it's still better than the racist paedophile Biden.
biden isn’t better than trump, so no, i will not fight to put him in power over trump
biden is, um, past his prime but he would dominate trump in a debate. A 2nd grader would dominate trump in a debate. Debates will not matter anyway. Peoples minds are made up right now. But a Warren VP pick could screw things up.
Joe Biden is a foreign policy guy.
Aw, not one of those Andrew Yang one-liners where he’s obv trying to build energy for Biden? Glenn.  I’m sad. You’ve saddened me!
These Bernie Bro’s have completely ignored the fact that Biden rapped Bernie to write his healthcare policy!
Biden's VP pick next week!
We need another candidate besides Biden - he is lost trying to listen and do everything the left are TELLING him - he should get the chance to sink or swim on his own terms - at this point it’s disgusting how he is attempting to appease the masses - not a sign of a true leader!!!
President Trump on Thursday suggested delaying November's presidential election, an unprecedented move as polls show him trailing his likely opponent Joe Biden in key states.
When did I say anything about Biden. I think he’s a diddler....but again...you’re but hurt, so you’re trying to change the argument
Vote for Biden
If Biden was president it most likely be epidemic confined to China He would have read his briefs listen to the experts and acted on that advice and worked hand in hand with Dr Fauci instead of slating him
they don’t need to declare him king for life lmfao they just need to pull a bush v gore. they have the supreme court, the senate and 30 state legislatures. if ron desantis and brian kemp say they’re not certifying the results and biden campaign sues, it’ll be bush v gore 2
Anyone remember when Biden said: "Mark my words, I think he is gonna try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can’t be held.”
I got a magazine from the  which I am no longer a member because I switched my craft to a mail handler. It said that  most Democrats and Republicans in office are controlled by Wall Street. Yet they still endorced Wall Street Democrat, Biden for President.
What a very old man to think that story would hurt Kamala and not Biden.
Next time someone asks me, "How can you be so cynical?" I'll suggest they ready  via
Hoping is not “old,” nor impossible. (note his Biden lapel button and vote)
If the list is Kumhither Matttress, Susan Benghazi Lies Rice, and Michelle Obama (nee Michael LeVaughn Robinson) then 2 of 3 are guys and Biden promised a woman.   Riots
Sometimes you subsume your interest so much that it doesn't get you reelected when it's your turn to steer the ship. Right,     Biden did it too, big guy.
lmao yeah biden’s gonna fix health insurance  eat a butt
That’s gorgeous. President Biden will make sure it’s done right.
It’s not settling tho. Joe Biden is an educated politician. He has a kind compassionate heart. He will be a leader for all, including Republicans. Most importantly he is not racist. You are a wonderful smart woman. Keep using your voice. 💙🇺🇸 #Biden2020
biden can’t be moved to the left
Thank Goodness this is a story about Dr. Biden.
right, ans i also think regardless, biden is still going to be appointing and getting republicans elected, esp of kamala is going to be on the ticket as well, either choice is a vote for a more punitive state
Man, President Biden will be stoked!
Vote by mail in Massachusetts! Send back the request for a ballot now. Hint: you can check off that you want a mail-in ballot for all 2020 elections (Sept. 1st Mass. primary &amp; Nov. 3rd Biden election).   #mapoli #TeamJoe #MAforJoeBiden #ArlingtonMA
These two put more black men in prison for smoking pot than anyone could ever imagine.. #WhiteSupremacists support Biden/Harris
I send my love to you! I miss having you as our President, and I can't wait to cast my ballot for Joe Biden. Trump &amp; Pompeo are falsely claiming that the DOJ has the power to postpone the election which is a lie, because only Congress and the states have that power.
BIDEN WILL Appease  &amp; ROLL OVER !  The radical anti-American and Tifa, squad, every special interest!   AMERICA YOUR NOT  STUPID !   Biden will be a puppet if he makes 3 months into his presidency, he will be lucky!  On day one don’t have papers drawn with the 25th amendment
Just so we’re clear, when Biden wins election this fall, this guy is paying for my celebration.
I'm in 😢
He should cancel the election and stay another 4 years.  Biden should step down and let it happen...
November 💙 is coming up soon and I will be there alongside all to vote for Joe Biden our next president of the United States of America ✌️✌️🙏🙏🙏 James

exactly. I hate biden. I’m voting for biden because I hate trump more.

awww poor baby,the President didn't wear a mask when you wanted him to. Stay safe in your basemant like biden.
Joe Biden's VP shortlist is finally another reason have two Tammys in our lives
You understand this election is not FOR Biden, it’s AGAINST your boy? People would vote for a piece of bbq chips so he doesn’t get re-elected. It’s pretty remarkable 😂😂😂
Of course, if Joe Biden, as president, said anything of the sort, these same Senators would be losing their minds.
Joe Biden is 4 years OLDER than Bill Clinton.
No worries! I do that sometimes too.. Looking forward to seeing how this case plays out. In an ideal world he gets sentenced in Feb 2020 so no pardon is available to him under a Biden presidency
I agree, just kind of hoping they’ll lose steam if Biden wins or Q gets revealed to be a troll or something but it feels like people losing their souls to misinformation campaigns is actually only gonna happen more and more
$nkla investors already knew at $94 that hydrogen infrastructure needs to ramp up to EU and China levels.  Biden announced funding. $TM partner $fcel building. With  hydrogen, need far less refueling stops w no charging time unlike $tsla.  Musk needs big retool $ for hydrogen.
Actually, I don't think people that voted for Biden would agree with your statement. The #1 priority is to get Trump out of office and to accomplish that -- pull as many GOP into either not voting for Trump or voting for Biden.
Marxism is when you vote for Joe BidenThe Dems have no message, instead Biden is stealing POTUS' message(s). The bring the fear mongers,domestic terrorists:BLM,Antifa hoping to scare Americans in to caving to their demands. They use race baiting,name calling. This is why Trump won&amp;will again!!
Val Demings is high on my list. No VP candidates are perfect. If not VD for Biden’s VP, then certainly for another position in Biden’s Cabinet. Of course I feel similarly about Biden’s other women candidates. They are all intelligent, accomplished, flexible &amp; good women 💛👍🍀🤞
I mean, the pictures of Joe Biden kneeling, with a mask, all sunny around him, outstretching his hands to grace a Black child. It's fuckin' "I'm your savior" propaganda. If he were a little more religiously based, he would probably pass himself off as the second Christ.
It won't be dangerous in Biden's America,  it's dangerous in Trump's America right now....
Wait did you all really push for Biden without having ever heard of him before?
He’s exactly the kind of person Nancy and Joe want to be the future of the party so Biden admin position, one hundred percent
ICYMI:  of  breaks down  latest Clean Energy Plan  Topline: “Biden is clearly moving in the right direction, and is taking the environment into account throughout his policy objectives”   #BuildBackBetter
Your willingness to publicly debase yourself for Biden for no real reason suggests you're not as ambivalent about him as you're pretending to be
Alright cool, but if they impeach him, isn't it gonna be pence vs Biden?
Trumpism is dangerous - it’s illiberal, antithetical to conservatism and anti-intellectual at its core. Biden/Rice is the most competent ticket. Keep in mind I’m not wild about Dem economic policy - it will literally hit me in the wallet- Trumpism is THAT dangerous. End
I support Joe Biden because he, for all his faults, puts us back on the path to normalcy. Where policy debates matter and thus populist, nationalist, isolationist Trumpism is repudiated. Bring out a Paul Ryan or Ben Sasse in 2024. 2/
He’s already doing it. A tight 20-minute Rally speech at Texas Oil.  High energy. Concise.  I don’t know about August, but whoever gets the earlier start sets the table. I suspect Biden will drop his VP this week(?) and start the engines for, as the kids say, realsies.  Buckle up
What’s on? The Election?  If Biden makes a splash with his already-later-than-Hillary-did-it-in-2016 VP announcement, Trump will have to keep up amid the hype.
Not gonna work Devin..Joe Biden and his son wete already cleared from wrong doing..Go play ..Oh by the way your out in 96 days..See ya

I know who I’m voting for, don’t believe you understand who you’re voting for though. If you look at the bills put forth by Biden before VP he isn’t for the American people he’s for Biden’s wallet
Yea Biden’s been accused by numerous women too but the main difference is there’s actual proof of Biden, and it’s clear as day the corruption within that man. Who also freely threw the N word around during senate hearings. Full blown racist! But hey yea have fun with the election
So many good candidates. And we are poised to have Biden and Kamala. Not surprised we are gonna have Trump for another 4 years ......
I was talking about Biden the actual pedofile, Trump has signed more executive orders than any other president to protect children and prevent sex trafficking to the point where he declared January prevention of human trafficking month. Do some research outside the fake news!
Like hillary and joe biden
Please #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020
tells us the media is liking Biden again and mentions all of his gaffes and knotty points but doesn't even touch on the obvious.  Biden is in the early stages of dementia.  #truth
I swear Joe Biden needs to pick a VP like several weeks ago so all of this can end!!
hot take: Tlaib having and demonstrating good political beliefs is probably good for turnout in her district so this probably helps Biden more than a humiliating demoralizing Sanders style capitulation would
that's going to happen to some degree, and it's gonna suck, but I can't imagine Biden being as effective in that role as Obama or Trudeau. There's no Bidenmania outside of dark and twisted CAP twitter and the current protesters don't view him as any kind of ally or leader.
You are a moron from A to Z.. Your secret agents were sent packing today...So please cut the dictator crap..knock it off..Is this supposed to impress your cult followers to vote for you..Your loosing so bad to Biden..US marshalls will drag you out Nov 4th..or be a man and leave
If Biden is our next president, the four loudmouths will be running the country.
There's a lot going on but it seems fucked up for a Joe Biden outfit to do a meme calling a woman a fucking bitch. I know the reference, and if she wanted to appropriate phrase fine, but otherwise this feels gross.

Definitely a good faith interpretation of Biden's statement from you. 🙄
I’m seeing a lot of takes today about how Biden and the Democrats fucking blow (and they do, they really do) but it seems to me the socialist Left has not figured out how to make inroads with the older black voters who propelled him to victory.
If I was the President I would make sure that my campaign would concentrate on these riots. Dopey Joe figures that if he gets elected these attacks will stop. They will not, they will get worse because Biden lacks the spine to stand up to them.
Biden just said he would pick his VP next week. It was supposed to be Saturday. Just pick someone Joe. I can’t take this nonsense anymore.
Biden/Harris or Biden/Demmings works for me
Biden is too risky! Perhaps my most inventive way to get him off the ticket, knowing the DNC will never accept Bernie, is replace w/Markey w/Demmings as running mate--a sure win ticket, with working class roots! Enables Kennedy to get Markey's senate seat.
Your next! Keep up your nonsense and you'll join your son..Everytime you tweet nasty messages..Voter supression on vote by mail ballots or bashing Joe Biden for your demented voter supression rants..I will report it to Twitter..This is Our Election.

A vote for trump is literally dangerous and treasonous Trump supporters and voters should be charged with treason and/or locked up in homes for the deranged and mentally dangerous. No one really wants Biden but it’s either politics as usual or the end of days.
Besides, i'm not saying DON'T pay attention but rather take in from all sources, don't expect this to come out the way that the polls indicate, there are plenty of days in between, and to work people to Biden.

It feels kinda weird that Harris was allowed to get away with the 'dont attack biden' rule during the primaries. Not even Sanders broke it. They went after Castro hard for skirting around it. Like... did she get permission or something?
That is the right answer.  Relief till Biden takes office.  Don’t need another round of $1200 check.  Democrats can give on that.

Why are libs ignoring the fact the Biden can’t even do an interview on his own
Enthusiasm for Biden is lower than polls suggest. Trump is running on Economy. If we’re in a better spot in November than today on Economy, Healthcare (including the Virus) etc... Americans won’t have the incentive for a big shakeup. We like continuity. Trump creates balance too.
Wasn’t he a friend of Joe Biden when he entered the Senate.
I think big cat is in the middle of pft and dave. But they had fauci on and hes become a political lightning rod, the leftys all over barstool have no problem giving there opinion, the double standard is gross and btw dave would interview biden, he doesnt care.
Exactly I'm sure dave would interview biden, dave doesnt care hes non political
I struggle with the logic we see in which “Trump does something minor and loses massive portions of his base or traditional GOP support... to Joe Biden.” Or “people mad that Trump isn’t doing enough of the things Biden claims are fascist/racist will vote Biden instead.” Nonsense.

That is a beautiful W but upper limit may be to low.  Or maybe we get a lightening bolt⚡️top for VIX.  Valuations getting noticed, Biden victory coming closer, Fall COVID-19 bump from a higher base, China friction/war, Iran/Israel/Saudi Arabia.  One or all of the above. Shit show
Maybe if you wanted trump out the dems should have gotten a better candidate. Biden just based on policies he has endorsed is a worse choice
I'm with josh here, never seen him speak well of biden at all, on Twitter or In person.
Yeah, hence the polls of Obama vs you, and Biden vs you. You know, watch closely because when you are an ex-president, sitting in a federal cell, nobody will be looking your endorsement.
Leakary, that is because Biden cannot pass one.  Why would you brag about not remembering your own address?  Would you brag about not being able to pass a balance test?
Yeah &amp; Biden is completely coherent. Two equal truths.

I could continue but I think that's enough.  Really, as a white dude, I remember how much Biden's "restore the soul," his vigorous defense of the Obama legacy, and his "good guy" tonic image to Trump grew on me in the primaries.  It's what got Biden to where he is today.

The fact of the matter is that this is NOT the time for liberals to be criticizing the Dem candidate. By all means, do so as soon as soon as we take back the white house. But doing anything other than offering full throated support for Biden only serves to help Trump
What does it even mean to be "too ambitious?" Maybe it means that she will want to move up the ladder by doing great work the way Biden did?
That’s an asinine headline. Is Trump’s version what “really running” looks like?
Kamala Harris has now answered these attacks, but Biden hasn’t.  Not a good look.
I dunno, Dwight Schrute's experience as assistant to the regional manager might have added confidence to the ticket... too bad Biden hamstrung himself with the debate promise.
A lot of people don’t know much about Kaine.  He was an Obama guy.  Mayor of Richmond, Governor of Virginia, Senator of Virginia.  Hardly an unambitious loyalist.  But it’s whatever.  Biden is already the Tim Kaine figure.
Disagree.  I think Klobuchar, Bullock, Bennet, etc. would have been fine as far as ideology.  But none have strong connections w/ the African-American community.  And none have the moral authority of the Obama administration nor the biography of Joe Biden.
Is this the right wing version of a vote for a spoiler is a vote for Trump (in this case Biden)?
Yes, this.  I mean I’m reading this articles and it’s like Biden is looking for a very quiet loyalist?🤔

Biden is as much a socialist as Reagan, who by the way signed a bill to ban assault weapons. It's more like Biden against Fascism, Racism, Nepotism, Sexism, &amp; Division
This is bad. It gives Trump even the weakest leg to stand on. (And don’t think he’ll be bothered by the contradiction of using this while smearing Biden with China.)
Biden, I’m sure, will have his pick from among 1,000s of countries toughest, most experienced politicians, prosecutors &amp; bureaucratic street fighters from both parties eager to fight that battle for him  #TraitorTrump
You overestimate Biden. it’s gonna be like 2016 again except you dropped out early and are supporting a man that can’t complete a coherent sentence. Yes Hillary is evil but at least she’s an evil genius.
There is only one round. It’s called an election. If you want to call mourning the death of his son, a veteran, from cancer a “nap”, enjoy looking at yourself in the mirror. And I don’t even LIKE joe Biden!! (Voting for him anyway, bc he ain’t trump.)

Opinion | Joe Biden accused Trump of trying to delay the election. He should know better.
Democracy is already dead. Biden isn't going to change the course were headed for. What are we actually going to do about it?
Another invite to the Warren/Biden fundraiser.  It’s like they don’t know me.😂😂😂
The establishment dems don't care about beating Trump. That's why they chose Biden over democracy.
This does seem within the MoE, though.  Biden is likely to get at the very most 53% in FL.  Trump is likely to get at least 45-46% in FL.
Either way you're gonna vote for Biden
I know he committed to tapping a woman for VP, but I'd be totally fine with Biden-Obama 2020.
To be fair, it's Biden's VP, that was there from jump
Trump wanting to delay the election?  Guess who spotted this coming.   Back in April.
Part of that is supporting Joe Biden regardless of whether he misspeaks or we don't prefer his VP choice.  America or Trump.  95 days until the election.
Misogyny is so strong.  I suppose that’s why we’re now supposed to believe no woman who has ever won an elected office is good enough to be Biden’s VP.  It would apparently be better to have a woman who has never even competed for office.
Biden lost to Obama.  He didn’t even win a single Iowa caucus.
This should be Biden’s entire campaign. “When I am President, I promise to just leave you the f*** alone, often for days and weeks at a time. You’ll be able to get through an entire day and not think about me even once.”
In addition to rehiring all the good citizens fired unjustly, I would like Biden to go full Godfather the day after the inaugural. Arrest everyone simultaneously: trump, Barr, vanky, Jared, Stone, Flynn, junior, nunes, pence, Pompeo...

2012 “Romney chooses the young ambitious Paul Ryan as his VP”                  2020 “  is too ambitious you can’t choose her as your VP Biden” I see you America😏 2 different meaning for the word ambitious when applying to white men &amp; black women.
Dunno about that.  A candidate would likely have to get 58-59 percent in VA to have Old Dominion called right away.  I think for Biden 55-56% in VA is his high mark and 50-52 percent is his low mark.  58-59% for a Democrat in VA -- even for Biden -- is really, really pushing it.
Bernie has been working OT to get people to vote for Biden, even making sure that the platform will get people fired up not merely to elect him but to give the GOP so many Ls that they'll need at least a decade to recover from it. And before you ask, I'm voting for Biden.
Who is this? Joe Biden's running mate?
No better strategy to make me root for  selection as  running mate.
If  and  already got their misogynistic way and Biden agreed not to nominate Harris, what is the point of smearing her?
It's crazy.  Harris is getting all these hit pieces.  The last Warren thing I saw was about what a close advisor to Biden she's become.
Biden will apologize to our friends, stop the pull-back &amp; recommit to our shared defense  Trump &amp; his ghouls will be nothing but a painful footnote in history His descendants will change their name. Those old enough to remember will spit at the mention of trump  #TraitorTrump

No more ads trying to stoke fear around a future with Biden by showing current images of our country?
This is how I feel about a lot of what we are talking about. All this mass death mass incarceration, Biden doesn’t want to change it, he created it. The idea of “lesser evil” is hard in that Trump utilizes the systemic racism that Biden helped expand in the 90s &amp; 2000s
Biden wants someone simpatico and ready. We all know why.
i think we all beed to consider biden a 1 term pres... abd he should too
Haven't forgotten what Whoopi said:  [Fwiw, when I saw that video right after Iowa, I knew Biden was going to win the nomination b/c those perfectly captured my sentiments this primary.]
Come on - is this question for real? Anyone who has watched/listened to  recently realizes that he couldn't be the leader of a kindergarten class at this point, let alone the free world! Jill Biden &amp; the Democraps should be ashamed of themselves, but they have no shame.
I have yet to see a single issue which Trump and Biden aren't on the same side of.
The Biden campaign is doing a fundraiser Friday with Warren.  I know this because they keep inviting me, no matter how many times I say no.
Biden’s already called Merkel and assured her he will reverse course in Jan. Meanwhile the pentagon will drag its feet. Thank god  Meanwhile, when is this f*cker gonna get Covid already?!
But both AZ/NC have the trifecta -- no way can Dems get to 270/51/218 w/o being at least competitive in both states.  And there are a very small number of scenarios where Biden wins AZ or NC but not WI or FL.  There is no scenario where Biden wins MI/PA/OH or or IA but not WI.
Pentagon will drag its feet, waiting for Biden to reverse
Remember that when Trump accuses someone, it's likely he's done it himself. So, this should read, "With Trump--our country doesn't have a chance." #BidenCoalition #TeamJoe
You show Trump up nine points among 65+. Monmouth had him up ten. Fox has him up by one. Yet Quinnipiac has Biden leading in this group by fourteen. Is this just sampling variability in a smaller subgroup? Given how reliably seniors vote, this divergence is pretty important.
Enthusiasm for Biden is tempered by differences over policies between him and those to his left. Enthusiasm for Trump has no policy basis, just cultish love.
That ignores his disastrous foreign policy actions which seem intended more to advantage Putin that protect American interests. Biden will have to spend a lot of time rebuilding our relationships with our allies and retreating from ties with authoritarians like MBS and Erdogan.

If anyone doesn't like Biden or his VP pick, they will LOVE the Trump-Barr "antifa Democrat reeducation" camps.
I don't know, I don't think it's Rice.  Biden has foreign policy experience.  He doesn't need that.  There's all these contenders who have won offices for themselves.  I think it will be one of them.
I’m attending Joe Biden for President’s event, “Michigan Racial and Economic Justice Roundtable with Stacey Abrams” – sign up now to join me! #StrongPublicSchools
My point is Biden is going to do jack squat for the environment or to meaningfully stop climate change
Mam your bio says you’re pro environment yet you’re out here stanning for Joe Biden? Lmao- he won because he was Obama’s VP, not any policies in particular
I agreed with you when Alon was bashing Southern States, and you were defending them.  I didn't agree with you when you said Bernie would do better in the GE in Florida than Biden.
I disagree.  The top priority of the next move is a universal premium cap [I think Biden has it at 8.5% for an 80% actuarial value (Gold) policy] and more generous subsidies.  That's the Biden/Buttigieg/Klobuchar plan.  Everything else is the cherry on top.
Biden is the Tim Kaine here.  He’s certainly not the Hillary.
If the Harris VP leak is real it makes sense- would be the best bank out of the possibilities for the establishment to try and coronate ahead of time as the 2024 nominee ala Hillary 2016 or Biden 2020. Hope AOC runs and can beat her
the media &amp; Biden fans like to emphasize his interpersonal empathy with people he has met. it's a fairy-tale anyway given all the nasty interpersonal interactions he has, but also it's beside the point: you can't meet every American so you need empathy for people you don't know.
It's not in Biden's power to meet their demands anyway.
Please register to vote for Vice President Joe Biden for President!!!
I honestly don't care what Biden thinks because Biden isn't so arrogant to ignore what his party wants him to do.
I think it matters way, way less because Biden will be beholden to his party in a way that Trump isn't. Trump is a self-absorbed egotist who has been trying his damndest to make himself a dictator since he got into office. Biden is just a mediocre politician.
I think a Democrat has to get at least 53% in my native VA -- a 45-70% probability w/ Biden -- to have *any* shot at taking NC.    A 55-56 percent win in VA -- not outside the realm of possibilities w/ Biden -- will definitely paint the Tarheel State Carolina Blue in Nov.
Most legislators have a residence in DC; Biden was an exception until he moved into the Naval Observatory.  Unless the announcement traffic goes through MKE, I'd like to see an Acela reverse-commute Secret Service locomotorcade WAS-WIL.
A riot is the language of the unheard. Biden's going to crack down on the protests, too, answering calls to end state violence with... state violence.
I know people have short attention spans, but the notion that Biden would destroy America seems to conflict with our experience before Trump took office. That was only four years ago.
OMG! You must be so concerned. 😂😂😂
Do you find your eyes watering up a bit when you see a tweet from Joe Biden saying basically 'everything will be ok'?  That's because you're being traumatized by anti-American, fascist liars in the WH &amp; GOP  This Nov, vote out trump's death crime cult  #TrumpVirus #ImpeachBarr
Omfg, trump is the president. This is America under trump. Biden is NOT running this shit show.
Interesting.  Well if Biden is gonna get back WWC voters in Missouri, it's probably gonna be voters in Jefferson County that voted for Obama... but the St. Francois portion is gonna be vitally important for the Dem candidate in the race.
The OP wasn't about now, it was about during the Biden presidency. Not arguing to not vote for Biden in the Fall, questioning the move of what follows. You could say either "it'll be better than now" (ground level bar) or "give him a chance" like he wasn't the vice president
This isn't about if Trump wins, this doesn't matter if he does. During Biden's administration he will do just what I said (good stuff) followed by what? If you're just soley focused on what happens up to getting Trump out of office, you're being short sighted
Yes.  He also has a broad understanding of the issue.  I know your point about Jr.  Because his family is now also in politics.  So?  Joe Biden's son was AG of Delaware.  Is your contention he should not have been?
Biden is not going to lose.

See, that’s a legitimate reason not to pick her.  Not groveling at Joe Biden’s feet after he made a mistake is not.
I’m not demanding Biden pick anyone.  I’m simply saying don’t use misogyny to smear Harris.  It’s gross.  I think that’s a fair request.
I think it's a fair question - what do they want in return? But, the thing is, they would need to negotiate for it now and as far as I can tell they haven't. They can't "own" Biden because he will be president already! For now, let's be glad for some very forceful ads!
I don’t recall Hillary’s team smearing their own VP prospects, and certainly not with misogyny.  Take it up with Joe Biden.  I’m not the problem here.

It’s ok if Joe Biden picks whoever for VP.  What’s not ok is that Dodd trashed Harris on his behalf.  I’m disappointed in the campaign, and it does make Biden look petty.  These leaks are either sloppy or intentional, and in either case, it’s a bad look.
Oh, I get your feelings about EW being picked since I share them.   What I’m wondering is how  interprets Biden meeting w/ EW on Friday in terms of the VP pick.

This isn’t the point, but you are aware there are still successful bussing programs right?  You’re passing a lot of misinformation about bussing.  But really, this is about at least someone from Biden’s team deliberating humiliating Harris without cause.  Now stop or I’ll block.
President Trump needs to stop attacking Biden from the Left, and Former Vice President Biden needs to stop attacking Donald Trump from the Right.

The reaction, apparently even in the Biden camp, is deeply unfair to Harris.
Given how demonstrably wrong you were about Joe Biden's appeal within the Democratic Party this year, I would think you would want to exercise a little bit of humility in evaluating Joe Biden's general election prospects.
Kamala Harris was explaining how as an African-American woman Joe Biden's comments made her feel.  That's all.
Me President, you should invite Biden to the WH to join you at a presser to stand up to the violence. He won’t accept and you could bring it up every presser. He’ll be left looking weak
While I think Harris is exceedingly qualified, the reason is Biden committed to a woman VP.
She has only foreign policy experience.  Biden has tons of FP experiences. What Biden needs is someone strong on domestic policy and someone would could really charge up young voters. It’s about turnout.  Biden just seems to ignore millennials
She literally said, "I know you're not a racist".  That's how she prefaced her comments.  Markey's opponents have made the same point about his opposition to bussing.  Biden apologized to her.
If Biden doesn’t pick Harris, that day on Twitter will be glorious for sitting back and just reading unhinged tweets from the K hive
Ron Klain should takeover the Covid response as soon as Joe Biden takes office.
Honestly, given how demonstrably wrong you guys were about your candidate's appeal and Joe Biden's appeal within the Democratic Party, I would think you would want to exercise a little humility in evaluating the influence of you and other white progressives on Joe Biden.

While the move to Biden among seniors is substantial, last I looked it COVID wasn't the major factor. Some polls showed increases in his approval, some decreases. Other than Quinnipiac, most of these polls returned to about where they were in January.
If Joe Biden would rather pick someone he’s ultra close to like Rice, fine.  But no one cares if Joe’s feelings were hurt at the debate.
I was concerned when Biden picked Dodd to run the VP search. I thought the decision indicated a campaign still out-of-touch with the realities of 2020. Luckily Biden can stay in his basement and still win.
This is typical Bernie. Most voted for Biden because didn’t want Med for all. Bernie will give election to Trump one way or another.
Finally, Galloway actually won the district in her statewide win.  This district is unlikely to be competitive at the local level (though anything could happen), but in a situation where Biden and Galloway are competitive, you might want to keep an eye on this district.

Sound logic, “Biden is a pedophile (0 evidence or accusations of such behavior) so I will vote for Jeffery Epstein’s good friend (who has several allegations from Epstein’s victims too) who wished Ghislaine Maxwell ‘well’ instead!!!”  You showed them!!!
The optics of Kamala Harris not being good enough for Chris Dodd is awful.  I cannot imagine why Team Biden thinks these leaks are a good idea.
It’s so great that Biden stopped talking about working with segregationists.  That’s what happens in a primary.  Your opponents call you out when you make mistakes and it makes you a better candidate.
Guess Biden should do the pragmatic and morally sound thing then and finally get behind M4A
Good. There is no moral case against M4A. Imagine being upset over this because “unity” rather than demanding the bare minimum of Joe Biden.
This makes my blood boil
Choose Biden.
As a Masshole, I’d expect Markey to say something like what Karen Bass has said — that my goal is to get Joe Biden elected.  Having been Vice President and been through the vetting process, Joe Biden knows probably better than anyone how to pick a VP.  Basic bullshitty answer.
Markey says Biden should choose Warren as VP, barring that, an African American woman.  Awkward answer.
Or  or   The strategic analysis is what will Biden gain vs lose. He is ahead on the polls; will probably have advised not to accept. He has nothing to gain and much to lose.
If Joe Biden wins the Presidency and Dems retake the Senate while retaining the House, Joe Biden is going to come into office with 15-20 percent unemployment and 200-250K dead Americans.

Right.  That’s where I am on FL:  Biden will get between 47-53 percent in FL on Election Day.  Trump will get somewhere between 46-51 percent in FL on Election Day.  Something like a 51-48 Biden win in FL seems most likely.
Disagree.  I can’t envision *any* scenario where Biden wins IA or OH, and already hasn’t won PA/MI/WI.  W/ AZ and even NC, there are a few scenarios where Biden wins PA/MI/AZ or PA/MI/NC but not WI or FL.  NC &amp; AZ also have important Senate races — NC a gubernatorial race, too.
Wow.  That is amazingly naive.  "All of our major races have plenty of money" is a dangerous and uninformed statement.  Do you think Biden, McGrath etc. share that view?  The money being spent on the Markey/Kennedy race could make an important difference elsewhere.
Biden new slogan! Bring Back Bankruptcy 🤣🤣
Republicans don't believe in a strong federal government, so don't expect the federal government to lead. Their creed is to leave everything up to the states.   Nothing will change until Biden takes office in January.
On Friday's 11th Hour Brian Williams made one of the more common "things can change" claims by making references to "Presidents" Dukakis and Clinton. Those elections had no incumbent running. 2020 is a referendum on Trump, not a choice between him and Biden.
Biden has a stutter -- always has -- and when he is concentrating on speaking without stuttering, he can sometimes misspeak.  It makes him look like he is confused; however, it is more likely that he is distracted by his intent to speak clearly.

Magical thinking. Dangerously negligent. BIDEN 2020
By your "logic" Joe Biden should disqualify himself. He's associated with the Catholic Church for years despite it's "clear history of abuse." But hey, have fun tearing down an accomplished black women with a hit piece sourced to a right wing rag founded by Tucker Carlson.
I live in Mass. I’ve seen project Lincoln commercials and Biden commercials but zero Trump commercials.
Jon, your side was cheated when Bernie didn’t get it. I dislike Bernie’s policies but not him. Seems very affable. Wild as a young Rep, but honest. Very honest. Biden is a freak mannequin bullshit artist. Can’t do it ever.
Heard "9 to 5" on the Biden-Warren call and sighed so heavily that my wife tapped my knee. #WarrenForVP
Biden is sad old dog that wants to sleep all day and pees around the house by accident.
Lololololol.  Biden would have to be left for him to do that. He's far-right.
This dude disgusts me. The fact that settle for Biden is a slogan is so fvcking gross. People like  clearly do not understand why it is we have Trump. Let me tell you. It's Biden.
I think she blew her chances when she attacked Biden during one of the debates. I too believe she wud be great on the ticket but look for Stacey Abrams

absolutely are the parallels between now and late 1920s/early 1930s Germany too on the nose.  Biden is still auth-right.  everyone in this election, and every US election for a century, has been auth-right, except Sanders, maybe Nader, do we get to Teddy for lib-right?

"Evanina (Dir. NCSC) ultimately acknowledged that Russia is again trying to boost President Donald Trump’s reelection and denigrate his opponent, the presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, sources who attended the briefing said."
1. This conversation is about the First Lady. 2. Biden has been concerned about the people of the United States for a lot longer than Twitter has even existed.
The fact of the matter is that this is NOT the time for liberals to be criticizing the Dem candidate. By all means, do so as soon as soon as we take back the white house. But doing anything other than offering full throated support for Biden only serves to help Trump
I think it is important to keeping a Democrat in the WH that Biden tee up his VP to run in 2024. And for that reason he should pick Kamala Harris
once should keep an eye on senate seats in swing states - MT, NC, GA, IA. If GOP thinks it cannot salvage presidency,  may tinker with senate elections (various ways to cheat and other countries can oblige) to keep senate in their control and obstruct any Biden agenda.
Joe Biden is up by 10 in every poll, though. Why would any of his stans ever care about VP, he's a shoo-in!

Not to mention “Latinos merecen alguien mejor que Biden” both treats Latinos as a monolithic bloc - sounds kinda like the “identity politics” they’re always railing against, no? - and also implies the race-baiting, xenophobic President is a better option... huh??
Biden has backed Senator Elizabeth Warren’s call to immediately cancel at least $10,000 of student debt per person. Learn more:  #HigherEd #EdChat
As I’ve said before, the debate kerfuffle was always going to be the toughest issue to get over, but she is still going to be the VP candidate.  No one else seems plausible, IMHO.
She is a republican. Don’t spread her trash and let Biden  make his choice..all the women are top notch.
If Biden does this, Trump would laugh. The race would be over.

If Biden's VP pick is suppose to succeed him as the next President, it should probably be someone Democrats already want to be President like Warren or Harris. If most voters will need to be introduced to the VP like Tim Kaine was, it's a missed opportunity for Biden.
With energy like this, Biden is going to lose in November.

In terms of the voting blocs in the recent primary, I think Markey will get all of Sanders, much of Warren, and some of Biden. Kennedy will get much of Biden, some of Warren, and none of Sanders. I like Ed’s chances.
I will be draining the swamp by voting for Biden. You are one of the worst U.S. presidents to sit in the oval office. The only Americans you have helped are your rich friends. We are voting you out in November!
I've decided that Harris would be the dumbest possible VP pick, because the only ones it would please are people like this guy, who can't even JOKE about making demands of Biden without adding a disclaimer assuring the reader that he didn't really mean it and will do as told
I'm black so i've never gotten a sunburn but I have to imagine rectal cancer is worse lol  I'm rooting for Barbara Lee, but Karen Bass will at least get me to not root against a Biden ticket
Same, Bass gets me to not root against Biden Barbara Lee gets me to root for a Biden ticket  Everyone else gets me to root against a biden ticket &amp; root for greens
I wish it were sooner too so this world can get back to normal. By the way, Trump is going to wipe the streets with Biden. Epic win...
Well, I was talking about Biden's team here, not the press.
I think you’re right  Trumps people will vote in person  Biden’s will vote by mail  But what does it all mean 🤣😂

Yep. When the Dems picked Biden I was like you have got to be fucking kidding me, we’re going to end up with 4 more years of Donald fucking Trump, aren’t we.
I’m not speaking to it’s quality, just the drop for Biden is interesting and noteworthy.  Also I’m out on 538, their analyses in 2016 were awful (not necessarily their fault).

Aka slime creature lobbyists are pissed because if Biden dies in office she will be potus and not cater to them. They’re very predictable. Old white dudes should retire this year. Go away. You’re wittingly and unwittingly destroying this country
Polling among all age groups also finds strong opposition to abortion without restriction up to birth and taxpayer-funded abortions — the position that Biden now holds.
Joe Biden is struggling to reach religious voters. It’s hardly a surprise. Biden is a pro-abortion Democrat who opposes religious freedom – even for nuns — and wants to force taxpayers to pay for abortions.
`That was my first thought but you know, if you don’t vote, you don’t vote. If Biden wins, I’m fine with them sitting around the trailer park, crowing about how Trump would have won if...   Works for me.

Maybe if you hadn’t spent 4 months telling Americans to ignore health officials, to not wear masks and to go to your rallies we wouldn’t be in this situation again. I’ll donate my $1200 to Biden’s campaign. I don’t want your blood money.
That awkward moment when you’re in such pure shock from reading the words “Joe Biden” and “further left” in the same sentence that you don’t even finish reading the sentence correctly
“Joe Biden is further left than Bernie Sanders” is certainly a take
He said  “she’s 12 I’ve never been into that”
There are so many women who are prepared, experienced, highly capable, to lead this country and be potus. I’m not sure why you demand anything like this. I’m sure Biden knows his choice is important if something happens to him. Younger ppl die. JFK, Bobby Kennedy were murdered.
Bernie Sanders and AOC are already on record supporting this maggot's right to vote. Does their marionette, Joe Biden, agree? Better question: Will he ever be asked?
Yup. And ironically their solution is Joe “You know, the thing” Biden.

"Joe Biden is far to the left of Bernie Sanders" might be the most ludicrous thing Donald Trump has said all day so far.
As usual, Trump supporters find ways to attack Biden, but never have a single positive Trump accomplishment to talk about. That's because there are none.
The video presentation during the Barr bearings prompted rhis no doubt. The democrats hate to see their agenda foiled by somerhing like video proof. The democrats had the same reaction when Biden was seen on video bragging about his quid pro quo violation.

Brown didnt “severely hamper” anything. He was notable only for having one time been a centerfold. He didnt do anything particularly controvesial and cast no swing votes.  The ACA was “hampered” by scared centrists that Biden as VP was able to push over the line.
Republicans want a stimulus extension of $1T. Democrats want more than $3T. If Biden is elected, and the Dems get control of both the Upper and Lower houses, get ready for extreme fiscal imprudence, and consequently, the implosion of the USD.
Joe Biden is president?
NYT article predicts Representative Karen Bass for VP, and explains why. If Joe thinks so, sounds good to me  😃
Hi, as an actual Mass resident, I can tell you it is 100% safe. The seat can be filled on Nov 3, and Brown was the first R senator in MA since the 1970’s.  I notice you say “almost” quite a lot as while ignoring it DID happen, in part bc VP Biden was whipping votes.
Where is it taking place? How many people can social distance in Biden's basement?
I’m counting the days until Biden pardons the entire Trump administration, and the entire MSM publicly orgasms like Sally in “When Harry Met Sally,” except they won’t be faking it.

They will manufacture “dirt” &amp; intentionally mislead. Barr will hold a press conf to deliver the msg they want. That will flood social media. Look at the crap abt Benghazi even after all the investigatns. The goal is to sway trump voters leaning twd Biden. If they’re still alive.

I'd like to co-sign as a white woman. The coverage of VP Biden's potential running mates is infuriating, particularly in the wake of 2016. Advisors/donors who are speaking &amp; leaking are hurting JB. They're not on his side, nor the country's. They're self-interested.

So bad....I’ve tried to see things from the other side and I just can’t figure out their thought process. Bottom line is that they will do anything and everything to get him out of office. If he is voted back in, it will be 4 more years of the same. And Biden? God help us.

When Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 her staff went to high level jobs at Apple, Google, Twitter, and Facebook.  Think that explains why tech stocks moved the NASDAQ to  all time highs, why Apple is now the most valuable company (over a Trillion) in the world, &amp; why Biden may win?
Biden’s wife should be charged with Elder abuse!!!
They can all go to hell, especially after Clinton having 3 million more votes in 2016. They inflicted this 4-year trauma on all of us, let them stew in their own paranoid delusions for the next 4-years while Biden and Democrats get shit done.
YES!!!!! If this is indeed the case I don’t think we’ll be seeing Donnie hanging around. He hates Joe Biden but he DEESSPIISES Nancy Pelosi.
Suddenly I’m less hopefully about the Veepstakes and feel so deflated.   Kamala has been working her ass off for Biden and to see her potentially derailed by weak white men threatened by her ambition is awful.    and  showed the type of people they are.
Not close to excited. I thought for sure Kamala now I am back to thinking Liz Warren give the very public bashing Kamala got from people close to Biden this week
But I feel like if you have to explain that I knew her at 12 and she was so “beautiful” (not pretty like most 12 yos are described) He was struck by it then say but when she turned 25... wink wink - still pervy
I agree with this. If I’m Biden I’m going with Harris and if not Harris then Duckworth. No reason to overthink it.   I love Warren but with things going the way they are (big lead, national pandemic) there’s no reason to give Trump &amp; his team such an obvious target / distraction
Trump administration does not even have to have chart every day Obama Biden during the swine clue refused to report cases because they said it was a pandemic and people where going to Die!!! Trump can even stop mass ted
and this is on top of all the voter suppression that Democrats let Republicans get away with uncontested because it helped Biden win the primary
So you're saying people can get free healthcare and still hate brown people? if you're planning on giving the South to Biden in November this is a good start
Free legal advice, first one to start snacking does not die in federal prison. I suggest you get to Biden's attorney general and make a deal before Devin Nunes does

are these series of Kamala is the reincarnation of the devil leaks from old white men a result of Biden already having told them she is the pick? And they dont like it?  Or Biden testing the waters to see if any of these slanders stick, thereby not selecting Kamala.

Not to mention, I make comments like this and not a single reply from Biden's social media team. It is as if they are using Twitter to lecture instead of engage with their audience – which is the purpose of the platform.
I do not plan to vote for Trump. As a marketer, Biden's marketing is just so horrible. None of his social appears remotely close to his own voice. And Marketing 101 is not to mention your competition – it just amplifies their voice. Worried about Biden's ability to communicate.
boy you aren't kidding. I have been noticing that they have been actively campaigning harder against Biden than actual Trumpers. Very "progressive" of them.
honestly didn’t give enough credit to people’s ability to see right through JK3 so this is a nice recovery from the nihilism I got from watching puppets dragging Biden across the finish line
Thought we were talking about Biden&amp;Trump here. Calling it for what it is...is not hateful. Keeping quiet on Dems unending relentless pursuit to get rid ofTrump ever since he stepped into office &amp;yet pretending to be the victims when conservatives fight back. Don’t instigate then
I really don’t think most voters will care about that. Plus I don’t think her Castro comments are that bad and even still Biden’s the top of the ticket and is clearly doing well in Florida.   Also Kamala living in Canada for years is a vulnerability that hasn’t been tapped yet.
Biden isn't in the video. You'd think a presidential candidate would share his presidential action plans instead of running on the platform: The current president stinks.
I think the media is the one dragging this out. He already said months ago that he would make his decision in early August. They've been covering potential picks nonstop since Bernie dropped out of the race. I don't think that's Biden's fault. My 2 cents.
They're for anything that is corrupt! You would have to be brain dead to vote DemonRat.  Unless you want all your cities to a lawless jungle. If Demonrat voters could take a glimpse into the future if Biden was elected, they would regret it every day that they lived. 💯%FACT!!

Biden isn't going to make those changes. He has always been a republic dressed with a D, and for some reason, you believe the democrats are the good guys even though they keep moving further and further right. Biden is a known pathological liar.
The treatment of Bernie and other outsider candidates by the party and their cohorts will drive  many embittered voters to not pull the lever for Biden IMO
It has nothing to do with the "lesser of two evils." Hillary is a democrat. Biden is a democrat. That's reason enough to never vote for either one of them. Democrats are cancer.

The fact of the matter is that this is NOT the time for liberals to be criticizing the Dem candidate. By all means, do so as soon as soon as we take back the white house. But doing anything other than offering full throated support for Biden only serves to help Trump
I think it is important to keeping a Democrat in the WH that Biden tee up his VP to run in 2024. And for that reason he should pick Kamala Harris
once should keep an eye on senate seats in swing states - MT, NC, GA, IA. If GOP thinks it cannot salvage presidency,  may tinker with senate elections (various ways to cheat and other countries can oblige) to keep senate in their control and obstruct any Biden agenda.
Joe Biden is up by 10 in every poll, though. Why would any of his stans ever care about VP, he's a shoo-in!

Yep. When the Dems picked Biden I was like you have got to be fucking kidding me, we’re going to end up with 4 more years of Donald fucking Trump, aren’t we.
I’m not speaking to it’s quality, just the drop for Biden is interesting and noteworthy.  Also I’m out on 538, their analyses in 2016 were awful (not necessarily their fault).

Aka slime creature lobbyists are pissed because if Biden dies in office she will be potus and not cater to them. They’re very predictable. Old white dudes should retire this year. Go away. You’re wittingly and unwittingly destroying this country
Polling among all age groups also finds strong opposition to abortion without restriction up to birth and taxpayer-funded abortions — the position that Biden now holds.
Joe Biden is struggling to reach religious voters. It’s hardly a surprise. Biden is a pro-abortion Democrat who opposes religious freedom – even for nuns — and wants to force taxpayers to pay for abortions.
`That was my first thought but you know, if you don’t vote, you don’t vote. If Biden wins, I’m fine with them sitting around the trailer park, crowing about how Trump would have won if...   Works for me.
Cuomo and Newsom have independently bungled their state responses why wouldn't Biden bungle the national response
Like it was the primary, these ppl need to get over it. Just like how Biden and Obama attacked each other during their primary and they got over it.

Alright but HOW MUCH of a turn would it have been if he went the other way?
The sad thing is a Democrat could have become president but they didn’t learn their lesson from last time. Millions of people in this country and they choose Joe Biden. SMH
No it doesn’t LOL. I haven’t even been able to get that $600 a week. I have four children. But guess what I get off my ass and hustle and make money I don’t hope for the government to take care of me. Trumps going to win so easily mainly because it’s against Joe Biden LOL

Maybe if you hadn’t spent 4 months telling Americans to ignore health officials, to not wear masks and to go to your rallies we wouldn’t be in this situation again. I’ll donate my $1200 to Biden’s campaign. I don’t want your blood money.
That awkward moment when you’re in such pure shock from reading the words “Joe Biden” and “further left” in the same sentence that you don’t even finish reading the sentence correctly
“Joe Biden is further left than Bernie Sanders” is certainly a take
He said  “she’s 12 I’ve never been into that”
There are so many women who are prepared, experienced, highly capable, to lead this country and be potus. I’m not sure why you demand anything like this. I’m sure Biden knows his choice is important if something happens to him. Younger ppl die. JFK, Bobby Kennedy were murdered.
Bernie Sanders and AOC are already on record supporting this maggot's right to vote. Does their marionette, Joe Biden, agree? Better question: Will he ever be asked?
Yup. And ironically their solution is Joe “You know, the thing” Biden.
A 17-year-old is among three people behind the high-profile Twitter hack earlier this month that targeted a range of people, including Joe Biden and Bill Gates, according to Florida officials.
Biden will announce the VP pick when they let him know who they choose.
Thirty felony charges have been filed against Graham Ivan Clark, 17, for allegedly scamming people across America, perpetuating the "Bit-Con" hack, according to a news release.
Don't try to jog Biden's elbow. He'll pick whom he damn pleases, and WE will #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica.

House Democrats subpoena Pompeo for documents on Biden's son

Florida teen arrested in Twitter hack that hit Biden and Obama
An honest media would be pressing Biden to make a live statement on this.
"Joe Biden is far to the left of Bernie Sanders" might be the most ludicrous thing Donald Trump has said all day so far.
As usual, Trump supporters find ways to attack Biden, but never have a single positive Trump accomplishment to talk about. That's because there are none.
The video presentation during the Barr bearings prompted rhis no doubt. The democrats hate to see their agenda foiled by somerhing like video proof. The democrats had the same reaction when Biden was seen on video bragging about his quid pro quo violation.
JULY NATIONAL POLL:  Would you support or oppose a national mandate for all individuals to wear masks in public where social distancing is not possible?  67% support 22% oppose 10% unsure or no opinion

A vote for Biden is a vote for China
Brown didnt “severely hamper” anything. He was notable only for having one time been a centerfold. He didnt do anything particularly controvesial and cast no swing votes.  The ACA was “hampered” by scared centrists that Biden as VP was able to push over the line.
Republicans want a stimulus extension of $1T. Democrats want more than $3T. If Biden is elected, and the Dems get control of both the Upper and Lower houses, get ready for extreme fiscal imprudence, and consequently, the implosion of the USD.
Joe Biden is president?
NYT article predicts Representative Karen Bass for VP, and explains why. If Joe thinks so, sounds good to me  😃
Hi, as an actual Mass resident, I can tell you it is 100% safe. The seat can be filled on Nov 3, and Brown was the first R senator in MA since the 1970’s.  I notice you say “almost” quite a lot as while ignoring it DID happen, in part bc VP Biden was whipping votes.
Things f'ing exploded all right, and we still wanted Biden over Bernie four years later. I'll never forgive you,
Where is it taking place? How many people can social distance in Biden's basement?
I’m counting the days until Biden pardons the entire Trump administration, and the entire MSM publicly orgasms like Sally in “When Harry Met Sally,” except they won’t be faking it.

They will manufacture “dirt” &amp; intentionally mislead. Barr will hold a press conf to deliver the msg they want. That will flood social media. Look at the crap abt Benghazi even after all the investigatns. The goal is to sway trump voters leaning twd Biden. If they’re still alive.
They know NUNES, GRAHAM, GRASSLEY and others received such packages of smut about Biden purportedly to make up will be used to create the"OCTOBER SURPRISE"leading Republicans are openly discussing,which means it's going to be underwhelming in impact but full of bullshit inuendo!
I'd like to co-sign as a white woman. The coverage of VP Biden's potential running mates is infuriating, particularly in the wake of 2016. Advisors/donors who are speaking &amp; leaking are hurting JB. They're not on his side, nor the country's. They're self-interested.
In his Biden interview, Ady Barkan reflected on the nominee's proposed budget for the NIH stating simply "I don't think that's enough." Watching him always moves me, but Ady having found in  someone whose "optimism and perseverance" ARE enough nearly brought me to tears.
Biden allies and others close to the vice presidential vetting process said California Rep. Karen Bass, the 66-year-old chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, has gained real traction in the late stage of the search  VP list with Karen Bass emerging
So bad....I’ve tried to see things from the other side and I just can’t figure out their thought process. Bottom line is that they will do anything and everything to get him out of office. If he is voted back in, it will be 4 more years of the same. And Biden? God help us.

When Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 her staff went to high level jobs at Apple, Google, Twitter, and Facebook.  Think that explains why tech stocks moved the NASDAQ to  all time highs, why Apple is now the most valuable company (over a Trillion) in the world, &amp; why Biden may win?
Biden’s wife should be charged with Elder abuse!!!
They can all go to hell, especially after Clinton having 3 million more votes in 2016. They inflicted this 4-year trauma on all of us, let them stew in their own paranoid delusions for the next 4-years while Biden and Democrats get shit done.
YES!!!!! If this is indeed the case I don’t think we’ll be seeing Donnie hanging around. He hates Joe Biden but he DEESSPIISES Nancy Pelosi.
Suddenly I’m less hopefully about the Veepstakes and feel so deflated.   Kamala has been working her ass off for Biden and to see her potentially derailed by weak white men threatened by her ambition is awful.    and  showed the type of people they are.
Not close to excited. I thought for sure Kamala now I am back to thinking Liz Warren give the very public bashing Kamala got from people close to Biden this week
But I feel like if you have to explain that I knew her at 12 and she was so “beautiful” (not pretty like most 12 yos are described) He was struck by it then say but when she turned 25... wink wink - still pervy
I agree with this. If I’m Biden I’m going with Harris and if not Harris then Duckworth. No reason to overthink it.   I love Warren but with things going the way they are (big lead, national pandemic) there’s no reason to give Trump &amp; his team such an obvious target / distraction
Trump administration does not even have to have chart every day Obama Biden during the swine clue refused to report cases because they said it was a pandemic and people where going to Die!!! Trump can even stop mass ted
and this is on top of all the voter suppression that Democrats let Republicans get away with uncontested because it helped Biden win the primary
So you're saying people can get free healthcare and still hate brown people? if you're planning on giving the South to Biden in November this is a good start
Free legal advice, first one to start snacking does not die in federal prison. I suggest you get to Biden's attorney general and make a deal before Devin Nunes doesPlease Biden select your VP so I stop getting "WHO'S YOUR PICK FOR VP????" fundraiser emails.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Come on, you can’t be seriously comparing Joe Biden to malicious dictator-in-training
Imagine that.  Who would have thought that Joe Biden had these thoughts...
No. 94 crime bill. Written by Biden. Patriot Act. Yeah that was Biden. The democrats have given Trump just about everything he wants. Caging children happened when Biden was VP. The neoliberal capitalists gave us Trump. Biden gave us Trump. Biden is far right.
Biden's not a pedophile.   Just another projection from Trump the sexual predator/rapist/sex trafficker.  #TrumpThreatensAmerica
Biden isn't going to make those changes. He has always been a republic dressed with a D, and for some reason, you believe the democrats are the good guys even though they keep moving further and further right. Biden is a known pathological liar.
The treatment of Bernie and other outsider candidates by the party and their cohorts will drive  many embittered voters to not pull the lever for Biden IMO
It has nothing to do with the "lesser of two evils." Hillary is a democrat. Biden is a democrat. That's reason enough to never vote for either one of them. Democrats are cancer.

By your "logic" Joe Biden should disqualify himself. He's associated with the Catholic Church for years despite it's "clear history of abuse." But hey, have fun tearing down an accomplished black women with a hit piece sourced to a right wing rag founded by Tucker Carlson.
I live in Mass. I’ve seen project Lincoln commercials and Biden commercials but zero Trump commercials.
Jon, your side was cheated when Bernie didn’t get it. I dislike Bernie’s policies but not him. Seems very affable. Wild as a young Rep, but honest. Very honest. Biden is a freak mannequin bullshit artist. Can’t do it ever.

I’m not speaking to it’s quality, just the drop for Biden is interesting and noteworthy.  Also I’m out on 538, their analyses in 2016 were awful (not necessarily their fault).
The  nat'l polling average with 95 days until E-Day:  2020: Biden+8.3 2016: Clinton+6.8 2012: Obama+0.4 2008: Obama+2.8 2004: Kerry+3.2 2000: Bush+7.5 1996: Clinton+15.2 1992: Clinton+23.1 1988: Dukakis+16.7 1984: Reagan+1.3 1980: Reagan+22.4 1976: Carter+27.4
Aka slime creature lobbyists are pissed because if Biden dies in office she will be potus and not cater to them. They’re very predictable. Old white dudes should retire this year. Go away. You’re wittingly and unwittingly destroying this country
Polling among all age groups also finds strong opposition to abortion without restriction up to birth and taxpayer-funded abortions — the position that Biden now holds.
Joe Biden is struggling to reach religious voters. It’s hardly a surprise. Biden is a pro-abortion Democrat who opposes religious freedom – even for nuns — and wants to force taxpayers to pay for abortions.
`That was my first thought but you know, if you don’t vote, you don’t vote. If Biden wins, I’m fine with them sitting around the trailer park, crowing about how Trump would have won if...   Works for me.
Cuomo and Newsom have independently bungled their state responses why wouldn't Biden bungle the national response
Like it was the primary, these ppl need to get over it. Just like how Biden and Obama attacked each other during their primary and they got over it.

Alright but HOW MUCH of a turn would it have been if he went the other way?
The sad thing is a Democrat could have become president but they didn’t learn their lesson from last time. Millions of people in this country and they choose Joe Biden. SMH
No it doesn’t LOL. I haven’t even been able to get that $600 a week. I have four children. But guess what I get off my ass and hustle and make money I don’t hope for the government to take care of me. Trumps going to win so easily mainly because it’s against Joe Biden LOL
Trump's Spending Is Delaying a Recovery. Biden Would Be Even Worse.|  Wire  #TreasurySecretaryMunchkin  #mapoli
Maybe if you hadn’t spent 4 months telling Americans to ignore health officials, to not wear masks and to go to your rallies we wouldn’t be in this situation again. I’ll donate my $1200 to Biden’s campaign. I don’t want your blood money.
That awkward moment when you’re in such pure shock from reading the words “Joe Biden” and “further left” in the same sentence that you don’t even finish reading the sentence correctly
“Joe Biden is further left than Bernie Sanders” is certainly a take
He said  “she’s 12 I’ve never been into that”
There are so many women who are prepared, experienced, highly capable, to lead this country and be potus. I’m not sure why you demand anything like this. I’m sure Biden knows his choice is important if something happens to him. Younger ppl die. JFK, Bobby Kennedy were murdered.
Bernie Sanders and AOC are already on record supporting this maggot's right to vote. Does their marionette, Joe Biden, agree? Better question: Will he ever be asked?
Yup. And ironically their solution is Joe “You know, the thing” Biden.
A 17-year-old is among three people behind the high-profile Twitter hack earlier this month that targeted a range of people, including Joe Biden and Bill Gates, according to Florida officials.
Biden will announce the VP pick when they let him know who they choose.
Thirty felony charges have been filed against Graham Ivan Clark, 17, for allegedly scamming people across America, perpetuating the "Bit-Con" hack, according to a news release.
Don't try to jog Biden's elbow. He'll pick whom he damn pleases, and WE will #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica.

An honest media would be pressing Biden to make a live statement on this.
"Joe Biden is far to the left of Bernie Sanders" might be the most ludicrous thing Donald Trump has said all day so far.
As usual, Trump supporters find ways to attack Biden, but never have a single positive Trump accomplishment to talk about. That's because there are none.
The video presentation during the Barr bearings prompted rhis no doubt. The democrats hate to see their agenda foiled by somerhing like video proof. The democrats had the same reaction when Biden was seen on video bragging about his quid pro quo violation.

A vote for Biden is a vote for China
Brown didnt “severely hamper” anything. He was notable only for having one time been a centerfold. He didnt do anything particularly controvesial and cast no swing votes.  The ACA was “hampered” by scared centrists that Biden as VP was able to push over the line.
Republicans want a stimulus extension of $1T. Democrats want more than $3T. If Biden is elected, and the Dems get control of both the Upper and Lower houses, get ready for extreme fiscal imprudence, and consequently, the implosion of the USD.
Joe Biden is president?
NYT article predicts Representative Karen Bass for VP, and explains why. If Joe thinks so, sounds good to me  😃
Hi, as an actual Mass resident, I can tell you it is 100% safe. The seat can be filled on Nov 3, and Brown was the first R senator in MA since the 1970’s.  I notice you say “almost” quite a lot as while ignoring it DID happen, in part bc VP Biden was whipping votes.
Where is it taking place? How many people can social distance in Biden's basement?
I’m counting the days until Biden pardons the entire Trump administration, and the entire MSM publicly orgasms like Sally in “When Harry Met Sally,” except they won’t be faking it.

They will manufacture “dirt” &amp; intentionally mislead. Barr will hold a press conf to deliver the msg they want. That will flood social media. Look at the crap abt Benghazi even after all the investigatns. The goal is to sway trump voters leaning twd Biden. If they’re still alive.
They know NUNES, GRAHAM, GRASSLEY and others received such packages of smut about Biden purportedly to make up will be used to create the"OCTOBER SURPRISE"leading Republicans are openly discussing,which means it's going to be underwhelming in impact but full of bullshit inuendo!
I'd like to co-sign as a white woman. The coverage of VP Biden's potential running mates is infuriating, particularly in the wake of 2016. Advisors/donors who are speaking &amp; leaking are hurting JB. They're not on his side, nor the country's. They're self-interested.
In his Biden interview, Ady Barkan reflected on the nominee's proposed budget for the NIH stating simply "I don't think that's enough." Watching him always moves me, but Ady having found in  someone whose "optimism and perseverance" ARE enough nearly brought me to tears.
Biden allies and others close to the vice presidential vetting process said California Rep. Karen Bass, the 66-year-old chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, has gained real traction in the late stage of the search  VP list with Karen Bass emerging
So bad....I’ve tried to see things from the other side and I just can’t figure out their thought process. Bottom line is that they will do anything and everything to get him out of office. If he is voted back in, it will be 4 more years of the same. And Biden? God help us.

When Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 her staff went to high level jobs at Apple, Google, Twitter, and Facebook.  Think that explains why tech stocks moved the NASDAQ to  all time highs, why Apple is now the most valuable company (over a Trillion) in the world, &amp; why Biden may win?
Biden’s wife should be charged with Elder abuse!!!
They can all go to hell, especially after Clinton having 3 million more votes in 2016. They inflicted this 4-year trauma on all of us, let them stew in their own paranoid delusions for the next 4-years while Biden and Democrats get shit done.
YES!!!!! If this is indeed the case I don’t think we’ll be seeing Donnie hanging around. He hates Joe Biden but he DEESSPIISES Nancy Pelosi.
Suddenly I’m less hopefully about the Veepstakes and feel so deflated.   Kamala has been working her ass off for Biden and to see her potentially derailed by weak white men threatened by her ambition is awful.    and  showed the type of people they are.
Not close to excited. I thought for sure Kamala now I am back to thinking Liz Warren give the very public bashing Kamala got from people close to Biden this week
But I feel like if you have to explain that I knew her at 12 and she was so “beautiful” (not pretty like most 12 yos are described) He was struck by it then say but when she turned 25... wink wink - still pervy
I agree with this. If I’m Biden I’m going with Harris and if not Harris then Duckworth. No reason to overthink it.   I love Warren but with things going the way they are (big lead, national pandemic) there’s no reason to give Trump &amp; his team such an obvious target / distraction
Trump administration does not even have to have chart every day Obama Biden during the swine clue refused to report cases because they said it was a pandemic and people where going to Die!!! Trump can even stop mass ted
and this is on top of all the voter suppression that Democrats let Republicans get away with uncontested because it helped Biden win the primary
So you're saying people can get free healthcare and still hate brown people? if you're planning on giving the South to Biden in November this is a good start
Free legal advice, first one to start snacking does not die in federal prison. I suggest you get to Biden's attorney general and make a deal before Devin Nunes does
Thank you for all you do.  We get it &amp; we can’t let up.  And now we learn 👉🏼NUNES was sent info frm a pro-Russia source in Ukraine.  👉🏼 Trump wanted “dirt” on Biden 2release b4 election. He got impeached for that...GOP doesn’t care. They’re STILL soliciting foreign election help.

JFC, at least people know who Kamala Harris is. Karen Bass has no name recognition outside her district and the beltway. Meanwhile both of these women are from a California, a state Biden will win easily.  I’m so disappointed that Stacey Abrams isn’t being talked about now.
Good, she should rub everyone the wrong way. Nobody gets to anyone without friction. And they're so worried about what she is capable of, it's beyond transparent

either option is shitty for Biden. Just like how this entire process has unfolded in the last 2-3 weeks. This all could have been much better. If he wanted it to...
are these series of Kamala is the reincarnation of the devil leaks from old white men a result of Biden already having told them she is the pick? And they dont like it?  Or Biden testing the waters to see if any of these slanders stick, thereby not selecting Kamala.

I'm getting really tired of reading "Biden is trash too". I get it; he's not Bernie. Now shut up and eat your veggies
Trump administration honestly said that it was gonna be awful if Biden takes off it will be worse
trump supporters: 👩‍🦯
Not to mention, I make comments like this and not a single reply from Biden's social media team. It is as if they are using Twitter to lecture instead of engage with their audience – which is the purpose of the platform.
I do not plan to vote for Trump. As a marketer, Biden's marketing is just so horrible. None of his social appears remotely close to his own voice. And Marketing 101 is not to mention your competition – it just amplifies their voice. Worried about Biden's ability to communicate.
boy you aren't kidding. I have been noticing that they have been actively campaigning harder against Biden than actual Trumpers. Very "progressive" of them.
honestly didn’t give enough credit to people’s ability to see right through JK3 so this is a nice recovery from the nihilism I got from watching puppets dragging Biden across the finish line
Thought we were talking about Biden&amp;Trump here. Calling it for what it is...is not hateful. Keeping quiet on Dems unending relentless pursuit to get rid ofTrump ever since he stepped into office &amp;yet pretending to be the victims when conservatives fight back. Don’t instigate then
I really don’t think most voters will care about that. Plus I don’t think her Castro comments are that bad and even still Biden’s the top of the ticket and is clearly doing well in Florida.   Also Kamala living in Canada for years is a vulnerability that hasn’t been tapped yet.
Biden isn't in the video. You'd think a presidential candidate would share his presidential action plans instead of running on the platform: The current president stinks.
I think the media is the one dragging this out. He already said months ago that he would make his decision in early August. They've been covering potential picks nonstop since Bernie dropped out of the race. I don't think that's Biden's fault. My 2 cents.
They're for anything that is corrupt! You would have to be brain dead to vote DemonRat.  Unless you want all your cities to a lawless jungle. If Demonrat voters could take a glimpse into the future if Biden was elected, they would regret it every day that they lived. 💯%FACT!!

we just had 8 years of Obama, republicans weren’t about to let a dem take office. But I personally don’t think they would have used Biden as he was very strongly against being president in 2016.  people were calling for him to run but he had just lost his son to cancer; grieving.
And also would Biden even be running if he did not feel the pressure from the left to take down Trump?

And there's a certain moral authority added to Joe Biden -- who as VP vigorously defended our nation's first black President and ran on restoring the moral authority in the office of the Presidency -- in picking an African-American woman. (2/2)
I could continue but I think that's enough.  Really, as a white dude, I remember how much Biden's "restore the soul," his vigorous defense of the Obama legacy, and his "good guy" tonic image to Trump grew on me in the primaries.  It's what got Biden to where he is today.

absolutely are the parallels between now and late 1920s/early 1930s Germany too on the nose.  Biden is still auth-right.  everyone in this election, and every US election for a century, has been auth-right, except Sanders, maybe Nader, do we get to Teddy for lib-right?
Biden requested early access to briefings, when it was clear trump was doing nothing about the bounties on our soldiers. The national security team has zero reason to withhold anything from the former VP/senator.
The fact of the matter is that this is NOT the time for liberals to be criticizing the Dem candidate. By all means, do so as soon as soon as we take back the white house. But doing anything other than offering full throated support for Biden only serves to help Trump
I think it is important to keeping a Democrat in the WH that Biden tee up his VP to run in 2024. And for that reason he should pick Kamala Harris
Biden has backed Senator Elizabeth Warren’s call to immediately cancel at least $10,000 of student debt per person. Learn more:  #HigherEd #EdChat

What does it even mean to be "too ambitious?" Maybe it means that she will want to move up the ladder by doing great work the way Biden did?
random question, but would their be a benefit to Joe Biden announcing his potential cabinet with the VP announcement.? Basically a “all your favorites are here” strategy?
That’s an asinine headline. Is Trump’s version what “really running” looks like?
Just a reminder to the many Trump supporters who say they won't accept the results if Biden wins... That is NOT up for debate. So build a bridge and get over it!!!
Kamala Harris has now answered these attacks, but Biden hasn’t.  Not a good look.
The Biden advisers who think Harris would be a disloyal VP--they are stupid advisers.
I dunno, Dwight Schrute's experience as assistant to the regional manager might have added confidence to the ticket... too bad Biden hamstrung himself with the debate promise.
A lot of people don’t know much about Kaine.  He was an Obama guy.  Mayor of Richmond, Governor of Virginia, Senator of Virginia.  Hardly an unambitious loyalist.  But it’s whatever.  Biden is already the Tim Kaine figure.
Disagree.  I think Klobuchar, Bullock, Bennet, etc. would have been fine as far as ideology.  But none have strong connections w/ the African-American community.  And none have the moral authority of the Obama administration nor the biography of Joe Biden.
Is this the right wing version of a vote for a spoiler is a vote for Trump (in this case Biden)?
Yes, this.  I mean I’m reading this articles and it’s like Biden is looking for a very quiet loyalist?🤔

I'm no fan of Biden, but bitter #NeverBiden dead-enders are no better than Dems whose entire politics are based only on opposing Trump.  The left's hope for national-level power died on Super Tuesday. Gotta let it go and focus on base-building: unions, tenant organizing, locals

Technically, we are in a deep Recession at the moment. However, by year's end we will be in an Economic Depression. President Biden will need the country's best &amp; brightest to solve the COVID19 crisis &amp; in order to solve the Economic Depression. It will take many years to recover

Did yo know? Biden has promised to make up to two years of community college free for all students. He’s also “endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders’ original proposal to make public colleges and universities free for families earning below $125,000 a year.”
Biden, I’m sure, will have his pick from among 1,000s of countries toughest, most experienced politicians, prosecutors &amp; bureaucratic street fighters from both parties eager to fight that battle for him  #TraitorTrump
The double standard has gone beyond what I believe would happen. This is a funeral for a great man who gave a lot to improve the life of American citizens. Obama, Biden, and the leader of Congress turned It into a biased political platform. Do we get it now?
Biden should be #45 , not 46, as #44 was the last one we had. .. the last 3.5 years have been devoid of a president.
There is only one round. It’s called an election. If you want to call mourning the death of his son, a veteran, from cancer a “nap”, enjoy looking at yourself in the mirror. And I don’t even LIKE joe Biden!! (Voting for him anyway, bc he ain’t trump.)
Bill Clinton is four years younger than Joe Biden. (This is true now, but I suppose it has always been true?)

Joe Biden's VP shortlist is finally another reason have two Tammys in our lives
I agree, just kind of hoping they’ll lose steam if Biden wins or Q gets revealed to be a troll or something but it feels like people losing their souls to misinformation campaigns is actually only gonna happen more and more
Biden called Trump the “first” racist to be elected president. That’s not just ahistorical, it’s a statement that should be disqualifying for a leader of the Democratic party. My latest:
According to the Social Security actuarial tables an average man Biden's age has a &gt;4% chance of dying per year. Aren't you worried that someone becoming president without ever winning elected office on their own (Rice if picked as VP) sets a bad precedent?
Great to work with        and  adding historical context to Biden's clean energy and environmental justice agenda.  #envhist
,#WeWillVote Biden even if is the last thing of my life!
Biden has sketched a 10-year, $775 billion proposal to promote universal preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds, new federal funds to support the construction of new child-care facilities, and an $8,000 tax credit to help low-income families pay for child care.
Opinion | Joe Biden accused Trump of trying to delay the election. He should know better.
Democracy is already dead. Biden isn't going to change the course were headed for. What are we actually going to do about it?
Another invite to the Warren/Biden fundraiser.  It’s like they don’t know me.😂😂😂
The establishment dems don't care about beating Trump. That's why they chose Biden over democracy.
This does seem within the MoE, though.  Biden is likely to get at the very most 53% in FL.  Trump is likely to get at least 45-46% in FL.

If only Biden had started talking about demon sperm and alien DNA. Then they'd be totally cool with it
I think nobody cares anymore because we already peaked with Biden inviting Stacey Abrams onto national TV specifically to embarrass her.
As fmr #Catholic Engagement Coordinator for #PeteButtgieg, I am glad that #JoeBiden is taking people of faith seriously. No candidate perfectly hues to the teachings of the Church, but this year, Joe Biden is a strong &amp; clear choice.
Either way you're gonna vote for Biden
I know he committed to tapping a woman for VP, but I'd be totally fine with Biden-Obama 2020.
To be fair, it's Biden's VP, that was there from jump
Trump wanting to delay the election?  Guess who spotted this coming.   Back in April.
I agree that Biden is not tough enough on China.  I'm puzzled by your decision. I stated the framing for my confusion hoping you'd explain where you disagreed, but if you don't want to I guess that's your own business. Sorry if explaining my framing came off as condescending.
An American election is a binary choice, and a consequential one. In practical terms not voting for Joe Biden strengthens the CCP. Do you dispute that assessment, or do you think that other considerations are more significant to you in this case?
If you really want a chance to take N. &amp; S. Dakota (and Arizona back from Biden), you’ll #FreeLeonardPeltier. That would probably stick it to Obama, too, since you’d be a world-wide hero for granting clemency to the U.S.’s Nelson Mandella.
Part of that is supporting Joe Biden regardless of whether he misspeaks or we don't prefer his VP choice.  America or Trump.  95 days until the election.

If Hirsch is under US jurisdiction, his hasbarah-mongering &amp; IDF service constitute probable violation of 18 U.S. Code § 1091 (Genocide). Biden was lead Senate sponsor of bill that became this law. Because Zio likes to screech Sen Remo, I note San Remo has no weight in US court.
Misogyny is so strong.  I suppose that’s why we’re now supposed to believe no woman who has ever won an elected office is good enough to be Biden’s VP.  It would apparently be better to have a woman who has never even competed for office.
Biden lost to Obama.  He didn’t even win a single Iowa caucus.
There is nothing you can say or do to keep me away from the voting booth on November 3rd to vote for Joe Biden!! Come Hell or High Water I’m There!! Joe Biden for President ☑️
This should be Biden’s entire campaign. “When I am President, I promise to just leave you the f*** alone, often for days and weeks at a time. You’ll be able to get through an entire day and not think about me even once.”
My brain read his handle as “Dr. Joe Biden” and I was like “holy smokes Joe got SPICY”
Great viz of a not-so-useful dataset. The red bars are basically Trump voters, so you're not really getting a sense of whether a particular VP is helping Biden with voter turnout.
In addition to rehiring all the good citizens fired unjustly, I would like Biden to go full Godfather the day after the inaugural. Arrest everyone simultaneously: trump, Barr, vanky, Jared, Stone, Flynn, junior, nunes, pence, Pompeo...

2012 “Romney chooses the young ambitious Paul Ryan as his VP”                  2020 “  is too ambitious you can’t choose her as your VP Biden” I see you America😏 2 different meaning for the word ambitious when applying to white men &amp; black women.
Following all! FB?
Biden is pragmatic and is/was hyper ambitious. He might not pick Harris (though he probably will) but it won't be for this reason.
We aren’t settling for Biden over here 😎
Pakistan also converted GB into their part so what? And which country supports u? Do u know Trump is losing and Biden may take over? And do u know what he recently said about India and Kashmir? Khawab e gafalt sa uth ra baba
If Friday is the last day of the MA legis. session, and Biden is announcing his VP pick next week, does that mean Warren is out of the running? Because Biden won't pick Warren unless he's confident the MA will change the law so Baker doesn't get to appoint her successor. #mapoli
Dunno about that.  A candidate would likely have to get 58-59 percent in VA to have Old Dominion called right away.  I think for Biden 55-56% in VA is his high mark and 50-52 percent is his low mark.  58-59% for a Democrat in VA -- even for Biden -- is really, really pushing it.
He has an exhausting task ahead.  Hopefully, we will have voted out all the assholes and will have surrounded Biden with good people.  That will make his efforts less arduous for him.

Bernie has been working OT to get people to vote for Biden, even making sure that the platform will get people fired up not merely to elect him but to give the GOP so many Ls that they'll need at least a decade to recover from it. And before you ask, I'm voting for Biden.
Who is this? Joe Biden's running mate?
But... usually you choose a running mate who has complementary experience and views. That’s why Biden was a good fit for Obama. Harris and Biden are...the same
No better strategy to make me root for  selection as  running mate.
Joe Biden will be 78 years old when he (hopefully) takes office. It would behoove us all if Harris DID spend the time learning how to be president.  That argument doesn’t even make sense.
God forbid Joe Biden's vice president want to be president.
If  and  already got their misogynistic way and Biden agreed not to nominate Harris, what is the point of smearing her?
It's crazy.  Harris is getting all these hit pieces.  The last Warren thing I saw was about what a close advisor to Biden she's become.
In other words, if the Russians realized that it is relatively easy to more or less directly target members of Congress (and all evidence points to GOP members being targeted), they wouldn't only do it on the Biden issue.  They'd do it on everything.
So I think the Russian interference concerns which are targeting of members of Congress are not just the Biden Ukraine nonsense (though it is most likely that in part), but also based on the 7/27 story, are likely targeting members of Congress with COVID-19 disinformation.
I initially thought this was only about this: 7/20 Inside the Biden campaign's pushback against foreign interference
I'll fix your Tweet for you (you're welcome):  Trump's only way to compete with President Biden is to try and cheat!
Ha, ha. That could be true. But, I guess we’ll never know.   I suppose if I lived in NH I might crack and vote Biden. But, a lot of good voting for Clinton did me the last time. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Biden will apologize to our friends, stop the pull-back &amp; recommit to our shared defense  Trump &amp; his ghouls will be nothing but a painful footnote in history His descendants will change their name. Those old enough to remember will spit at the mention of trump  #TraitorTrump
Biden often says strange things, but this one seems pretty coherent?
Whenever Biden announces his VP pick, I'm going to need to stay off twitter for a week because the takes are going to be too hot.
If Joe Biden wants to lead, he needs to specifically decry the violence in Portland and Seattle and call on local officials to stop it, writes
The black lives most at risk are inner-city school children. A Biden presidency won’t help them, writes
This week's is about the policy and politics of Biden’s $2trillion climate plan, which is what happens when an elderly man gets cyber bullied by Greta Thunberg. Hope you enjoy it!   And if you hate it then you are correct
Why would this even be a problem, given that Biden has said he only plans to serve one term if he’s elected?
I didn’t care for Kamala Harris when she ran for president but the fact she been called “too ambitious” think maybe she is exactly what Biden needs. #weonlytooambitiousforlowtiermen
Especially as a running mate for Biden, who is running as a generic moderate Democrat! And  might realize this if she hadn’t just blocked me for pointing out that Harris’s presidential campaign didn’t make it out of 2019 for a reason!
Harris doesn’t believe in anything! She ran for president because people thought she would, was shown to have no real beliefs, and the one thing she went after Biden on she didn’t even believe in herself! Harris is milquetoast as they come.
No more ads trying to stoke fear around a future with Biden by showing current images of our country?
Right? Biden has often said that he doesn’t plan to run in 2024.
This is garbage. She’s the obvious best choice &amp; not for nothing, as VP, she 💯 SHOULD BE READY TO BE PRESIDENT! That is actually part of the gig. Also, Biden is not young. These are facts. #sexismsucks
This is how I feel about a lot of what we are talking about. All this mass death mass incarceration, Biden doesn’t want to change it, he created it. The idea of “lesser evil” is hard in that Trump utilizes the systemic racism that Biden helped expand in the 90s &amp; 2000s
i think we all beed to consider biden a 1 term pres... abd he should too
I'm less worried about Biden, and more worried about the LP backers spending the next four years on cable news labelled as the political geniuses who won the election. Which means their commentary on what is and is not reasonable policy will have influence on the zeitgeist.
if Democrats grab hold of the senate in November AND it’s Biden as president.. gonn be a lot of anti trust suits and divesting for these tech bros
Haven't forgotten what Whoopi said:  [Fwiw, when I saw that video right after Iowa, I knew Biden was going to win the nomination b/c those perfectly captured my sentiments this primary.]
I have yet to see a single issue which Trump and Biden aren't on the same side of.
Trump has clearly not studied the history of sieges. We can swear Biden into office even if Trump is in the bunker.
Why can't he just say no to tailoring features or feeds to help Biden?   This is very weird.
The Biden campaign is doing a fundraiser Friday with Warren.  I know this because they keep inviting me, no matter how many times I say no.
Barack Obama got over this and selected Joe Biden as his VP.
Biden’s already called Merkel and assured her he will reverse course in Jan. Meanwhile the pentagon will drag its feet. Thank god  Meanwhile, when is this f*cker gonna get Covid already?!
Then tell the world your voting Biden. Otherwise your part of the problem.
Remember this? "I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy," Biden said. "I mean, that's a storybook, man" 2007
man fuck Joe Biden
Also, I’m at the point where I just assume that whatever reactionary nonsense policies Trump rolls out between now and January will just be rolled back by the Biden administration.  Yes I’m overconfident, don’t  me
But both AZ/NC have the trifecta -- no way can Dems get to 270/51/218 w/o being at least competitive in both states.  And there are a very small number of scenarios where Biden wins AZ or NC but not WI or FL.  There is no scenario where Biden wins MI/PA/OH or or IA but not WI.
Pentagon will drag its feet, waiting for Biden to reverse
Joe Biden’s climate bet – putting jobs first will bring historic change | US news | The Guardian
Yeah but Monmouth tends to be a bit D leaning (538 has them at D+1.3), and the voter suppression effort is going to be intense. Biden has a chance tho.   Same with Texas. I think Biden has a chance but odds downballot r tough. Opposite of Montana haha
Can  replace Biden in the 2020 elections? Like forreal.
You show Trump up nine points among 65+. Monmouth had him up ten. Fox has him up by one. Yet Quinnipiac has Biden leading in this group by fourteen. Is this just sampling variability in a smaller subgroup? Given how reliably seniors vote, this divergence is pretty important.
Enthusiasm for Biden is tempered by differences over policies between him and those to his left. Enthusiasm for Trump has no policy basis, just cultish love.
No and yes.  Last poll was in May by Emerson. We’ve seen Baker and Trump/Biden polls in state since then that didn’t even bother to ask about the primary.
Team-Putin has successfully 'mind-gamed' much of the American system including the run-up to the November 2020.    National trust is smashed.   And trump keeps stepping on the remaining shards that team Biden can use to rebuild.  Same for the supposedly pro-national security GOP
That ignores his disastrous foreign policy actions which seem intended more to advantage Putin that protect American interests. Biden will have to spend a lot of time rebuilding our relationships with our allies and retreating from ties with authoritarians like MBS and Erdogan.
Fake New's CNN Wolf Blitzer reported totally inaccurately The President's briefing; unlike Biden The President answered random questions.  Blitzer went back into his man cave to promote his false narrative

So sick of women in leadership being held to a different standard
It’s getting to you, isn’t it? Baiting Biden will not work. His feelings don’t get hurt when others get negative, unlike a certain president who whines and pouts whenever someone says something to hurt his itty bitty little feelings. #TrumpleThinSkin #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
Biden-Scanlon has a ring to it
If I had to guess, I’d say that Biden wins It in a Very tight race, and Collins wins it by a similar margin. Golden holds on to the seat
you think the party of joe biden and the party of mitt romney would not be in a coalition?
If anyone doesn't like Biden or his VP pick, they will LOVE the Trump-Barr "antifa Democrat reeducation" camps.
I don't know, I don't think it's Rice.  Biden has foreign policy experience.  He doesn't need that.  There's all these contenders who have won offices for themselves.  I think it will be one of them.
I think Biden is the best person from that field in terms of what we need from a president right now (experience, especially with foreign policy) but I’m always gonna wonder who would have been the nominee if Biden and Bernie didn’t run.
Prove. If you’re “done”, donate to Biden and post the screenshot.
I’m attending Joe Biden for President’s event, “Michigan Racial and Economic Justice Roundtable with Stacey Abrams” – sign up now to join me! #StrongPublicSchools
My point is Biden is going to do jack squat for the environment or to meaningfully stop climate change
Mam your bio says you’re pro environment yet you’re out here stanning for Joe Biden? Lmao- he won because he was Obama’s VP, not any policies in particular
The platform isn't going to disagree with the nominee, but Biden is just being plain stupid on marijuana. There are real policy subtleties on with M4A, and Biden's proposals will still be an improvement over the status quo, but I really don't get his positioning on marijuana.
....not sure that Joe Biden could hold a grudge.  Be annoyed at people? Sure. Grudge? Not so much.
I agreed with you when Alon was bashing Southern States, and you were defending them.  I didn't agree with you when you said Bernie would do better in the GE in Florida than Biden.
I disagree.  The top priority of the next move is a universal premium cap [I think Biden has it at 8.5% for an 80% actuarial value (Gold) policy] and more generous subsidies.  That's the Biden/Buttigieg/Klobuchar plan.  Everything else is the cherry on top.
Biden, because enough 2016 Trump voters are either weary of Trump or astonished by his incompetence by this point.
Biden is the Tim Kaine here.  He’s certainly not the Hillary.
the Biden statement was bad and this is the correct take
If the Harris VP leak is real it makes sense- would be the best bank out of the possibilities for the establishment to try and coronate ahead of time as the 2024 nominee ala Hillary 2016 or Biden 2020. Hope AOC runs and can beat her
I know this is hard. Let us help guide you during this terribly confusing time. This. Is. America. Under. Trump. Biden hasn’t won yet. I know you just want it all to be done—believe me, so do we. But you can’t rush this process. Be patient.
the media &amp; Biden fans like to emphasize his interpersonal empathy with people he has met. it's a fairy-tale anyway given all the nasty interpersonal interactions he has, but also it's beside the point: you can't meet every American so you need empathy for people you don't know.
It's not in Biden's power to meet their demands anyway.
Please register to vote for Vice President Joe Biden for President!!!
I honestly don't care what Biden thinks because Biden isn't so arrogant to ignore what his party wants him to do.
I think it matters way, way less because Biden will be beholden to his party in a way that Trump isn't. Trump is a self-absorbed egotist who has been trying his damndest to make himself a dictator since he got into office. Biden is just a mediocre politician.
I think a Democrat has to get at least 53% in my native VA -- a 45-70% probability w/ Biden -- to have *any* shot at taking NC.    A 55-56 percent win in VA -- not outside the realm of possibilities w/ Biden -- will definitely paint the Tarheel State Carolina Blue in Nov.
Most legislators have a residence in DC; Biden was an exception until he moved into the Naval Observatory.  Unless the announcement traffic goes through MKE, I'd like to see an Acela reverse-commute Secret Service locomotorcade WAS-WIL.
A riot is the language of the unheard. Biden's going to crack down on the protests, too, answering calls to end state violence with... state violence.
I know people have short attention spans, but the notion that Biden would destroy America seems to conflict with our experience before Trump took office. That was only four years ago.
and  proposal to have the FOMC target African American unemployment rate is:  1.) An incredibly progressive policy aim (if somewhat low-key). 2.) Was completely absent in the primary debate. 3.) Now in Biden's platform.
OMG! You must be so concerned. 😂😂😂
Tuning in but VP Biden is on??
Do you find your eyes watering up a bit when you see a tweet from Joe Biden saying basically 'everything will be ok'?  That's because you're being traumatized by anti-American, fascist liars in the WH &amp; GOP  This Nov, vote out trump's death crime cult  #TrumpVirus #ImpeachBarr

Interesting.  Well if Biden is gonna get back WWC voters in Missouri, it's probably gonna be voters in Jefferson County that voted for Obama... but the St. Francois portion is gonna be vitally important for the Dem candidate in the race.
The OP wasn't about now, it was about during the Biden presidency. Not arguing to not vote for Biden in the Fall, questioning the move of what follows. You could say either "it'll be better than now" (ground level bar) or "give him a chance" like he wasn't the vice president
Mass INC polled on Charlie Baker and Biden/Trump but didn’t bother with Markey/Kennedy.
This isn't about if Trump wins, this doesn't matter if he does. During Biden's administration he will do just what I said (good stuff) followed by what? If you're just soley focused on what happens up to getting Trump out of office, you're being short sighted
We have Massachusetts polling!......just not the race we expected.  Biden leads trump by 32.  #mapoli
IMO, climate change mitigation and the energy economy frankly dwarf the operation details of our health insurance system. Biden is almost fully adopting the green new deal. Get some perspective please. One-issue voters are so tiresome.
Yes.  He also has a broad understanding of the issue.  I know your point about Jr.  Because his family is now also in politics.  So?  Joe Biden's son was AG of Delaware.  Is your contention he should not have been?
Biden is not going to lose.

It’s a baby step but a much needed one! via
Yes! This! I really hope Biden's VP will be  tho.
I’m not demanding Biden pick anyone.  I’m simply saying don’t use misogyny to smear Harris.  It’s gross.  I think that’s a fair request.
I think it's a fair question - what do they want in return? But, the thing is, they would need to negotiate for it now and as far as I can tell they haven't. They can't "own" Biden because he will be president already! For now, let's be glad for some very forceful ads!
I don’t recall Hillary’s team smearing their own VP prospects, and certainly not with misogyny.  Take it up with Joe Biden.  I’m not the problem here.
This will be an excellent symbol of healing when Biden rips it down.
Nuts. A Vaccine is NOT a political pressure...is something RELATED TO LIVE or DIE! Of course, he prefers a vaccine AFTER November no mater how many will die.
As long as the other 70% vote for Biden, I’m okay with that.
I see signs of dementia in one presidential candidate and it isn’t Biden.
It may not be Russia. Reports are that China and others also want to sew divisiveness and a lack of faith in our electoral process: to undermine democracy in general. This position is divisive and will pull support from Biden. It’s a good idea executed with selfish insensitivity.

Does Shapiro or anyone at the DNC actually know what US law says about genocide? Biden was lead Senate sponsor of  18 U.S. Code § 1091 (Genocide). Does Biden &amp; Shapiro know what it says? Has either even read 18 U.S. Code § 1091 (Genocide)?
It’s ok if Joe Biden picks whoever for VP.  What’s not ok is that Dodd trashed Harris on his behalf.  I’m disappointed in the campaign, and it does make Biden look petty.  These leaks are either sloppy or intentional, and in either case, it’s a bad look.

Well obviously we’re just having a cultural misunderstanding here. We liberal coastal elites don’t understand what Joe means by “vote for” or “Biden” and “Trump.” This is one of those off color jokes maybe.
I don't think Biden would be able to figure out how to post a message tbh
Trump and Biden are both authoritarians. It is happening here.
The politics of the American liberals and Democratic Party will get appreciably *worse* if/when Biden wins.

This is such the opposite of truth it hurts.  Thinking Biden is an accetable option is the privileged position. The Democrats are enabling Trump's fascism. Electing Biden isn't gonna stop America's fall into totalitarianism.
democrats are funding Trump's fascism and doing nothing for the poor. If Trump wants to bribe people to win the election 🤷‍♀️ at least people will be able to eat. Things won't get any better under Biden, either.
Exactly. I wish she had gotten the nomination and not Biden. Been a fan of her for 3 years. Definitely voting for Biden, but she was my first choice.
Tell Biden to eat a pint Ben and Jerry’s
I’m not about to. I don’t know who he is and I don’t care. POTUS is posting racist shit as he brags about repealing an Obama/Biden era affordable housing policy but they’re the same side‽
don’t tell anyone but i’m biden’s VP pick
Biden is not left
Say what you will about Joe Biden being a Trojan Horse, you can't deny that he's going senile.   What sort of presidential candidate has to be led by his hand so he doesn't say something stupid to the press? Is hand-holder lady going to save him from the debates with Trump too?
Also "represent the worker" since the DNC and Biden have been focused on women and BIPOC civil rights he clearly means white men. That's what this language has always meant.
President Donald Trump is painting a dystopian portrait of what Joe Biden’s America might look like, asserting crime and chaos would ravage communities should the former vice president win the White House in November.
Oh absolutely! I always assumed that’s why they dropped out and endorsed Biden in the first place
This right here is why I'm not voting for Biden
I thought the same thing. No lifelong moderate or republican is about to vote for Bernie, but they might be convinced to vote for Biden
I'm trying really hard to care about all these interviews and congressional testimonies. I honestly don't care, anymore. I've reached my saturation point. I just want to vote for Joe Biden, today.
I can think of a half a dozen reasons why we NEED YOU TO RUN BUT THAT ONE TOPS THE LIST!!! Biden 2020!!!
Honestly I think that a lot of people were split between Bernie and Warren, especially if they weren’t looking deep into the specific differences between them. If it had been Bernie vs Biden I think Bernie would’ve done much better
Biden is not a socialist. And if you can't accept a Democrat as President, you open the door to any louse whom the GOP ever nominates, no matter how incompetent or evil.
Tlaib is probably helping Biden by not endorsing him.
I’m voting for Biden and there is quite literally nothing that could happen to change that.

Nevermind. I found out. I'm not surprised. She's better than Biden, like Warren. They don't want her ambition anywhere near the man.
That would be weird since it wasn’t Biden who wouldn’t unequivocally commit to accepting election results.
Man y’all gone be mad when Biden chooses a white woman for VP. Not even a sometimesy, fake progressive like Warren. It’ll be a real Karen, like Klobuchar. I’m convinced it would have been her if the events in MN didn’t happen.
Bernie was the choice for the primary. However, the fact that the democrats didn’t try to elevate Warren and decided on Pete and Biden shows you how bad they are. They even tried to push Bloomberg on us. And I can’t stand Warren.
Biden should Candace Owens or Diamond and Silk for VP. Or maybe Katrina Pierson because they’re black women.
Black people on TV have lost touch with every day black Americans. We watched a black president do the same thing every white president has done but they think we care about JOE BIDEN’s VP pick?  Come tf on.
What kind of take is this? We’ve had a black President, why are we supposed to be excited about a black Vice President? A position that most agree is only meaningful should something happen. Joe Biden was VP and needed every single thing to go his way to win the nomination.
Susan Rice Wants to Run for Office. Will Her First Campaign Be for V.P.?
I have been a conservative since the late 1970s. (Sometimes as Republican, sometimes as Independent.) Voted for Reagan twice, Bush 41 twice. I'm voting for Biden because I've seen what Trump and his supporters think of the COVID-19 pandemic.
AP-NORC poll: Anxiety props up Biden, Trump voters fervent
that he is a racist rapist, the architect of both the American police state and surveillance state, and that getting the Green party federal funding or debate access will do more longterm good than helping Biden be the fascist in charge
yes so people like Joe Biden.
yes.. of which Nancy Pelosi/Joe Biden are a currently major part of.
I agree thats the end of America, but Biden has said literally -nothing- about it. I wouldn't expect he would end the practice.
george was talking about people like Joe Biden.
Why are Biden supporters unable to recognize that he is a wolf in sheep’s clothing, namely a megalomaniac, a liar, a grifter, a failure, devoid of lucidity, unintelligible, corrupt and totally uninterested in the well being of Americans?
you did not listen to the words that were said if at the end of this you still say "joe biden 2020"
hey Linda, George Carlin said voting doesnt really matter because of politicians like Joe Biden, or did you not listen to any of the words Carlin said?
george carlin. who would have absolutely hated Joe Biden and other establishment democrats. so stop trying to pretend like this is a win. May he rest in piece and may the democratic party rot in hell.
they forgot to include establishment democrats like Joe Biden and Pelosi in the video strange.
Liberals are bastions of being inconsistent and pretending not to be. see: Kavanaugh and Biden, Joe Rogan and literally any Republican who supports Biden, etc etc
Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Ed, you gotta get major endorsements from Biden, Harris, and Bernie. AOC isn't enough to save you.
Isn't it funny how we never had FAKE NEWS until we got a FAKE PRESIDENT.  Biden will win in November!!! Make no mistake about it!!!!!
Donald Trump isn't worth a single American life. Dr. Fauci will report to President Biden starting next January.
Price he doesn’t say he can win by write ins, just beat Biden. This clownery is clearly designed to help his friend Donald.
Joe Biden has rolled out a new campaign to protect the environment and fight climate change! Look up "Joe Biden Save the Jungle" to see how you can help out!  #ResistanceTaskForce #WakeUpAmerica
Idk who needs to hear this, but don’t write in kanye. A vote for anyone but Biden is a vote for trump, and I don’t think this country can survive 4 more years of trump. Democracy is on the line.
So the newest ploy that's "the end of Drumpf!" is some old George Carlin rant out-of-context. And the people who edited the video go out of their way to call half of America "dumb-ass motherfuckers"  I guess they went to the Hillary and Biden school of insulting voters to win...
We get it. What does BLM or whoever the rioters want, anyway? Level the Courthouse. Elect Biden. Free money. You can't agree on any terms. Help me.
for whom? Biden enabled this with his crime bill and Patriot Act. If they all show up,  is gonna be President. so, yeah, lets do it
you'll beat Biden off?
I still don’t know what I’m doing in the voting booth una November. I know I’m sure as hell not voting for Donald Trump and about 95% sure I’m not voting for Joe Biden.
Ok this wins the Joe Biden Malarkey meme competitor. That smile is just…
whats gonna happen if Biden ends up tweeting a lot of weird rambling old people stories. Are liberals gonna hold him accountable for failinng to uphold campaign promises?
Dude, Obama and biden used those cages for a short term and didn't use family separation as a "deterrent" to immigration. They also focused on deporting people that committed crimes, not keeping out asylum seekers. And they still removed fewer people than the previous admins!
Trump is a Liar. Republicans who are not racists and do not condone lying by our president and the entire administration are supporting Biden.  Not because Biden is a great choice but because Trump is a paranoid sociopath who is unfit for office
I hope Biden picks Susan Rice -- Susan E. Rice’s vice presidential chances rest on something others lack: A long relationship with Joe Biden
Where do you come up with these delusion stats?  I think you're talking about Biden's approval ratings.
Safer. DV has been an increased problem, Joe Biden wrote VAWA that last I knew hasn’t been reauthorized. I feel like we didn’t solve the opioid epidemic, just ignored it. And announce Kamala already, she has the record as a prosecutor of putting away violent criminals.
Joe Biden voted no on Thomas in committee and on the floor. I don’t know what you’re talking about. There was an influx of unaccompanied minors during the Obama Administration, hence the cages, families weren’t separated as a “deterrent” as they are now. Asylum seekers were...
In VP search, Biden has a known quantity in Susan Rice
PETER LUCAS: Without Obama, Joe Biden is lost If President Donald Trump wants to debate Joe Biden he will have to break into Biden’s basement. Because Joe Biden is not coming out for a while, no way.
Any indication if this will lead directly to Biden, or will it stop at subordinates?
Fox News Poll: Biden tops Trump in battlegrounds Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania  #FoxNews
the world already is laughing at us bc of joe biden being the nominee.
More of your lies. How wonderful. More deflection, more projection, more back peddling, and talking about Biden's stuttering problem, you shameless half wit.  Winning!!! NOT!
Are u serious ..... he’s a fool and a puppet     Biden 2020
Why is McCabe not a convicted felon?  Or Strozk? Or Brennan? Or Comey? Or Hillary? Or Clapper? Or Rosenstein? Or Biden? Or Obama? Or Schiff?
Similar question why doesn’t Joe Biden ever get anything other than softball questions questions about all his past racist comments or questions about Burisma or Hunter?  Or his rape allegations?
Every single day Biden says something, I hate the Democrats as a party a little bit more. Doesn't mean I'm liking Republicans more either. It just means, politics is controlled by old hot garbage white men that need to be removed, replace, and scorned for their outdated beliefs.
U voting for Biden?
Oh please Biden would not want this at all. Ones protesting are paid I will bet on it.
At this point I want Biden or Warren to step in and tell Kennedy to drop out. This fight may have serious consequences for the general election.
Lisa good job with Biden’s record vs trumps for being called the R word.  🔥✔️
#ImVoting4BidenBecause he has a plan that will save the environment from climate change!  Look up Joe Biden Save the Jungle to learn more!  #SaveTheJungle #Biden2020
I cannot evaluate the truth of this statement bc McConnel has failed to define his terms. By far left, does he mean Marxists? Bernie Sanders+his supporters? Warren Democrats? or Biden/neolibs? Cuz these are four very different groups, but only the first 2 are even on the left.
unfortunately Biden is still not Bernie Sanders
so often I see Biden supporters claim stupid things are just out of context and then share the whole context claiming it fixes it, and its always either 1) still stupid/bad/racist or 2) utter nonsense word salad
Obama blasts Trump, praises Biden in new 2020 campaign video
I don't want a "fighter." After the last four years, I'm sick of the hyper-partisan infighting. I would like a president who would at least TRY to bring Americans together to fight this coronavirus pandemic. I don't know if Biden will. But I know for sure that Trump will not.
Watch this. Then watch Biden and Obama’s discussion that I just posted. The choice is obvious.
so you agree what biden is doing is reprehensible in those pictures
I don’t get what they think they’re proving here. That worse case scenario Biden will be as bad as Trump‽
You might not realize this, but that footage literally shows what is happening in Trump's America. You're saying Biden will just keep things the same?
Crossroads | Joe Biden For President 2020  via
stop lmao this is the same logic they use for biden
DR. BIDEN get your husband serious medical help before it is too late.Seriously??
THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE ARTICLE BY PATRICIA DICKSON, ON HOW BIDEN IS SO DISMISSIVE OF BLACK PEOPLE. THE DEMOCRATS THINK THEY HAVE THE ELECTION IN THE BAG. SHE BELIEVES BECAUSE NO ONE IS SPEAKING ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT IS GOING ON, THAT BLACK PEOPLE CANT SEE WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE!
How in the world can anyone vote 4 Biden. I truly believe what ur guest said + I said this before. People are so scared to say anything, let alone say they are voting 4 TRUMP! #scaredinamericia
LETS NOT FORGET IT WAS ONLY 5 MONTHS AGO! TRUMP WILL TURN THIS ECONOMY RIGHT AROUND. HE WILL KEEP HIS PROMISES LIKE HE DID FIRST ELECTION. MAKE NO MISTAKE, BIDEN WILL NOT BE SERVING OUR COUNTRY. IT WILL TURN INTO VENEZUELA!
HE IS LITERALLY RUINING DOWN A CAMPAIGN SPEECH THAT BIDEN COULD NEVER ACCOMPLISH. AFTER HIS FAILED ADMINISTRATION HE HAS ALOT OF NERVE. WORST PRESIDENT EVER. STOKING THE FIRE FOR RIOTERS. SCUMBAG!
CAN'T BELIEVE OBAMA IS USING JOHN LEWIS EULOGY TO ACT LIKE HE IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT SAYING THAT THE POLICE ARE ASSULTING QUITE DEMONSTRATORS! WHAT A FUCKING DIRTY MOVE. THAN SAYING THE ONES ON THE OTHER SIDE. JUST SAY IT BARRY THE REBLICANS. YOU NEED TO  DO WHAT BIDEN CAN'T.
It’s about time Kaepernick got some credit for standing up for what he believed in and after this Unpresidential president is voted out of office Biden should acknowledge him with The medal of freedom
She did say she's voting for him, but only as an anti-Trump vote. I feel like most people should understand that, considering A) she lives in a swing state B) Biden insults her and her family with his anti-Palestinean stances, nvm other progressive issues
Joe Biden isnt Christian?
So now we're watching Biden answer questions instead of Barr..come on!!
Once again, I am asking for a #MAsen and #MA04 poll, we did not need a poll to know the obvious about Massachusetts voting for Biden
Because Trump and his campaign will just say Biden is not mentally fit to debate. Not a good idea
I think Pence's disgusting, nauseating sycophancy is tied to him desperately trying to keep the VP spot. I still feel like Trump will dump him for Nikki Haley once Biden announces his pick.
It's simple, If you back Biden , you don't watch Chris Hayes.
So top pro-life priests say don't vote for Biden. I'm not a Biden fan but that's really rich coming from an organization that protects and enables pedophiles. Do you see the dichotomy? Do you need more children to abuse? Is that it? You're disgusting.
Um, Have him escorted out by the National Guard?? As the Biden campaign has already indicated they will do.
Biden will actually be my last choice on my ranked choice voting ballot here in Maine. I know my first two choices won't garner the % votes necessary, so my vote will trickle down to Biden. That way I'm not voting for him directly. It's the only way I can do it.
Biden needs to announce his VP pick this week and put Trump out of his misery
Biden’s campaign is ‘suppressing the Hispanic vote’ in Florida, an internal letter claims  via
Bobby Rush is out there. Even Biden hasn't got to where he's at yet. As 4 violence etc. It's simple, make people accountable 4 their actions with real arrest+prison time. They should have done this the first week all this B.S. started. It's now getting way out of control
That great economy Trump has bragged about was built by Obama and Biden and TRAITOR, Rapist Trump had nothing to do with it....
Make no mistake, Biden is gonna beat Daddy.....Like A Drum.
Sadly, it doesn't matter what Biden says or does. He can B in the ICU +people will vote 4 him cause the hate 4 Trump. This whole political, virus, violence, hate, lies+twisted comments would never been believed 30 yrs ago. U know y? People wouldn't let evil happen.
The bad people are getting more+more momentum each day. By Nov US will be a total mess+ the bad guys would have succeeded+Biden will win. Trump has to clean the streets NOW of all the thugs. Call in the military. It's come time to fight violence with violence.
Mad TAXPAYERS just had ENOUGH of the DEMOCRATS in the HOUSE and SENATE for saying this that PRESIDENT Trump is FIRST President to be call RACIST This totally Wrong its other way around! All you DEMOCRATS been Racist since the beginning of his term! Biden need to shut up his mouth
Again, economy you keep bragging about was built by Obama and Biden..No matter what you do..You have killed 100s of 1000s of American lives because you are incompetent with no empathy and a TRAITOR..!
People listen if a sign bothers you. Whether it says Black Lives Matter, All Lives Matter, Blue Lives Matter, Trump Pence, Biden, Obama. There is one thing you can do...drive past it.Tonight’s theme, FLIP IT BLUE. Watching both #dailybeanshappyhour and the Biden/Warren fundraiser... Also, my fluffy podcat. Stay cool, stay safe, wear a mask, and #VOTEBLUE!!!…
Is it treasonous to be anti-MAGA, anti-Qanon, anti-fascist, pro-BLM or pro-Joe Biden?  Is it treasonous to say this country deserves better than the raging pandemic and crashed economy brought on by Trump and his death cult?
With Biden’s double digit leads in almost every national poll, with him leading by between 8-10 points in swing states, and with him within striking distance in Georgia, Ohio, Iowa and TEXAS, I haven’t seen a lot of Bros and 🌹 Twitter talking that smack lately, interesting...
For those who can’t/won’t vote in person, can’t we vote using ZOOM? Hold SS card/ ID up to screen, have RMV agent verify it’s you, cast vote by saying it out loud.  “Trump” or “Biden”.  Agent cast vote in the box for you, all live streamed/recorded.
via  Sorry tRump no can do totally illegal!
The summary description of Jill Biden’s book still kills me— this is the most Joe Biden thing I’ve ever seen—  “how did you get this number” just gold.
If someone asked Biden if he’d pick a wombat for a running mate, beating out the person who asked him if he’d pick a woman, he’d have also said “yes”. Whatever they place in front of him, he always says “yes”.
Don’t let Biden fool you!
Wow! Biden is now trying to change his tune and sound more like Trump!   What does that tell you? He’s a liar. Just look at the low life liars he’s considering for VP!
If you want America to become Russia, China, Cuba, Venezuela then vote for Biden. You see what Dem rule looks like!  If you want safety, law and order, a quality life for you and your family, then vote TRUMP 2020!
Marie Harf commented that Biden is a moderate, but added “a moderate with some progressive ideas.”  Gotcha! Prof ideas are anything but moderate. Can’t be both! Biden is no moderate! Look at those with whom he associates.
I don't think you watch her interviews.... she uses every chance she gets to promote and talk up Biden
Probably much less than biden, pelosi, waters, nadler, and schumer have in the last 40 yrs...
Watching the Democrats in action I cant help but notice how all they know is how to criticise the President.   I have noticed they never have any idea of what they would have done differently than the President.   Biden uses what the Pres has already done as his strategy! 😂
The article itself agrees with you.  It's supporting Biden.  Not sure why you'd want to attack other Biden supporters.
Dem Members of the House Judiciary Committee are conducting Biden 2020 campaign commercials under the auspices of a Bill Barr testimony since they have no desire or intent to hear any testimony, reclaiming my time from these a-holes.
Joe Biden is uniting all of us!
It isn’t Congress ...
Kamala has support across the nation. Biden said himself that he wants someone with whi they agree with on major policy issues, but can give it to him straight when he is making a bad decision. That Person is  ... He needs a partner 4 8 yrs. Karen only wants 4 yrs...
Always hopeful, but Biden suddenly tacking left is only slightly more realistic than Trump maturing into his job.
You mean gilded age.  This is all happening under your watch.  You’ve already manifested what you accuse Biden of promoting.  I can’t wait to wake up in a President America!!
I hope Dr. Jill Biden enjoys next spring's blossoms.
White fence for the White supremacists in the White House...I hope Biden has it torn down as trump is marched down the driveway into prison.
Kamala is hands down the best at calling out trump... n biden is not picking someone who they can't agree on much
I am predicting October surprise gifts from Putin, Xi, and Un.  False trade and/or arms treaties for which Trump can declare victories.  Also, a late Biden scandal or smear that after Nov. turns up false.
U mean a poll way back in May? We in July dude.. she has been no. 1 on chris Cillizas vp choices 4 15 weeks and many others too... warrn who lost her home state to joe biden n bernie sanders would be worst pick.
At the barest minimum Biden needs to be able to hear feedback that his words, politics, and votes caused harm to black people. Get thee behind, Chris Dodd.
People’s Republic of Taxachusetts; Charlie Parker (per Joe Biden) RINO in charge.
JFC on a bicycle. 🤦🏻‍♂️  A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn’t pretty
Are all of you living in what Dems call suburb sprawl beware. If Biden wins Dems will go after single family dwellings.   They try to shaft you even if you go to resell your single family homes. Be careful what you wish for. Vote Biden and lose Freedom (AFF8)
AFF8 is a regulation Democrats have sought to use (Under Obama &amp;Biden).   It takes money away from suburbs &amp;uses it to build inner city multi level housing.   It destroys single home zoning allowances. They want to herd us like cattle into inner cities!   Dems try to get it now.
That is a travesty. I hope Biden has it removed immediately after inauguration!
Trump supporters her a nazi mask 😷 and them tell is Biden’s fault what world is this please tell me   #maga  #kkk #Democrats #usa
The funny part is you wearing a zwastika and then tell people if you vote for Biden than what gonna happen ( but you vote for trump right)
Biden hasn’t
Agree everyone must vote even if poll is ahead for Biden. We can win if everyone vote. I am voting mail.
just saw a trump commercial in which an old woman is watching the news about lawlessness in Trump's America and a man breaks in and murders her??? and at the end it says "you won't be safe in Joe Biden's America" and I guess I'm just wondering what's happening????
AS PRESIDENT, JOE BIDEN WOULD NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS LYING TO YOU, AGAIN.   SHOCKER
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
“Beat Biden off” - be my guest JT
He’s not wrong, he will have more write in ballots than Biden.
Harry you said at the end there that there’s still a large amount of undecideds which could swing the race either way. In many polls Biden is over 50 percent, so in that scenario wouldn’t Biden still win if Trump won 100 percent of the undecideds? Just curious.
No 👏 Sleep 👏 Till 👏 Biden 👏 (chanted to the tune of The Beastie Boys' "No Sleep Till Brooklyn")
Get Biden on with Ebro
Storm Troopers? They are Federal Officers and the law, the Constitution calls for the President to engage in such protection!  Have you been close to Biden? Sounds like you’re catching his disease!
We will cancel you and your cult members in November. When Biden is President, we will once again have culture, class, intelligence and experience in the White House.
As the face of the company he’s largely choosing the direction it goes. Big Cat mentioned that they turned down a biden interview but took this one. While Portnoy doesn’t shut down his employees opinions it’s not hard to see why makes these decisions and who he caters to
just decided that when I cast my vote for Joe Biden this November it will NOT be for Biden but for RBG because if she goes there’s no way I’m letting a Brett Kavanaugh 2.0 take her spot
She is at top cause she is the most compatible with Biden....she is looking at the future.... imagine if biden picks someone who wants to cut military budget... he could be painted with not caring about the military.  .... and plus they work fir the people not just the left
Joe biden would have voted No as well...
Thank you for planning to vote for Joe Biden.We need our country back.
Yeah, we won’t have to hear him self-aggrandize over a cognitive test for football players with concussions and people with dementia. Doubting that Biden’s gonna expect a goddamn medal for drinking a glass of water with one hand. STFU, Nikki. You’re not going to be President.
CREEPY JOE IS BACK! BIDEN TALKS ABOUT NURSES BREATHING INTO HIS NOSTRILS  ‘I had nurses who would bend down and whisper in my ear’
How about the Dems let Biden talk without a teleprompter.  That’s their biggest fear
Aren’t you missing the point that this is Trump’s America. Biden is not presently President so don’t blame him.
Why would Bernie get to choose a progressive like himself rather than a ‘moderate’ to help unify the party? 🌹 on the left now say Biden MUST select a progressive in order to appease them, but that doesn’t seem to have been the standard if Bernie would have won. Interesting, no?
I’m attending Joe Biden for President’s event, “North Carolina Biden for President Roundtable with Kamala Harris” – sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
I didn’t support Biden in the primary, but AA voters saw something in him, that he was the most electable. Bernie would not be ahead in GA, TX, OH, IA, Trump would have reframed the debate from Covid to ‘scary socialism’ and it would have been harder to win. They were right!
wait until you see tonight's Biden/Obama ratings! Tremendous ratings, like nothing you've ever seen before.
Biden’s a bigger racist.
Make something happen your the boss light the torch of liberty and justice under somebodies  ass and nail the dirty scoundrels the wall, Hillary is a devil, Obama is a disgrace, and Biden is a sick joke,Hey  - just checking but are you going to be writing a follow-up piece on the one attacking Biden for saying Trump might try to delay the election? I'm really looking forward to it
Wow. I'm impressed! Not only great on issues but great on messaging.   Listen to: Rep. Karen Bass Is On The Short List To Be Joe Biden's Running Mate -
So let’s close the world up tight &amp; not continue to live our lives?? We can all cower in our basements like Biden did!   Such a true leader he is!!! 🙄   Thank God Trump didn’t do that or we would all b dead!  Vote Trump! 🇺🇸 Keep Biden in his cellar.😡
True leaders???  Like Joe Biden?Once this country surrenders to a democrat, our country is gone!  How u can listen to a demented old fool, Pelosi, who lies, cheats, hates our president &amp; our country, is beyond sanity!?  And Biden can’t think/talk &amp; Is a socialist! GL with that!🙄
Yes! VOTE BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT! Let’s fix what Trump broke! #Biden2020
So you’re saying he is going to 1.start a ground war and 2.3.4. Get his Russian handlers to create a scandle and frame Biden and then create phoney mail in ballots and hack the 50 state election system. Might work except he put Jarred in charge.
Keep Biden away from tanks.
A. Do you want to line up at the Trump Rx POP-UP station pay a $50 copay (in addition to the $300 fee Trump Inc will charge your insurance company (Trump)OR B: able to go to your Dr ,clinic, Drug Store, school, Workplace, town hall etc to get it FREE of charge (BIDEN)
Steve.. Haley keeps praising Trump simply because Biden will select an amazing Woman As his VP.. Trump will pivot and dump Pence and put Haley on his ticket as VP.. so predictable....Have you seen or heard Joe Biden
Yes, some of Biden’s VP candidates are cringe-worthy. But he could choose Snooki or Honey Boo Boo at this point and I’d still vote for him over Trump.
What did Biden say, Trump is a xenophobia. None of these clowns took it serious back then the only one who did was TRUMP.
Trump failed? He was ahead of it all, He shut down travel from China and from Europe way before Doctor Fauci, the CDC, Democrats , Pelosi, Biden even took Covid serious. What did they say about the Travel ban? Fauci it's not needed. Pelosi, go to china town hug upon people.
We must near fear him he is WEAK and we are stronger VOTE BIDEN
Ok I read it and it’s the standard liberal lies written by an intellect but even smartly worded lies are still lies. The left hates DJT and Barr because it can’t control them. They love Biden because they totally control him. 🐑
But your black..... what about Biden?
Will  STEP aside for #VPPence to run for #GOP #Presidential #Candidate against #Biden
I will cash that check and donate to Biden.😆😅🤣😂
Biden said it months ago that Trump was gonna pull this shit- And 🌟🌟SURPRISE🌟🌟 He did! Even Republicans Said NO delaying or postponing It was NEVER done through wars &amp; all It's NOT gonna happen now!!
I dont think Biden was friends with Epstein.
There’s no helping these Berners even when you explain to them that even Bernie is voting for Biden.
Just as many ppl will die when biden gets in too...
Bernie's voting for Biden. Are you?
Can we laugh at these clowns yet?!? So they just proved THEY dont know WTF is going on n Biden is on point!!!!

Joe "shoot 'em in the legs" Biden says anarchists should be arrested.
Making me choose between Biden or Trump is like making me choose between Stalin or Hitler and then getting mad because I choose to live in Switzerland because I don’t want to live in a world of evil, whether that evil is ”lesser” or not as evil is still evil.
I think Biden will do fine! Even Texas is smart enough to know the truth! Go Texas lol!
You do know we have presdential term limits right? If you would pay attention instead of just swallowing all the crap the media is pushing you would see that the peaceful protests have been taken over by anarchists and I have yet to hear Biden denounce these people.
Biden will spit you out and blow you away. Good riddance to bad rubbish.
I think voters' minds are already made up. Barr's bullshit is made for an electorate of 35%. The game changer is Barr's DOJ arresting Biden on some bullshit charges. It's possible.
2. It’s about breaking the cycle where in good times, Latino communities still lag behind. In bad times they get hit first and the hardest, and in recovery, they take the longest to bounce back.
Yesterday Biden called this a Black Agenda, today he replaced black with Latino.  1) Joe Biden: (06:14) Just yesterday, I rolled out the fourth plank of my Build Back Better agenda. It’s one that focused on building on racial equality across every aspect of our economy.
Biden also sniffs and gropes children.
Former Segregationist get endorsed all the time; hell I now support Biden... Biden apologized for it though...
Even if they like this they may like a function government more and vote for Biden
Hilary is the reason trump is in office and Biden is the reason he will be re-elected.   Our options are very grim this time around too.  We shouldn’t have to vote for the lesser of two evils.   Hopefully 2024 will produce better options.
Go back to sleep Biden.
Nothing will keep me from voting for Joe Biden but my preference would be a woman of color. So many good choices and the moment calls for it.
Warren is my Senator. I love her. I voted for her in the primary and donated to her campaign.   These people are idiots. I'm voting for Biden. Period.
I honestly don't think Biden knows what it means, either. Still gonna vote for him, tho.
The thing they claim to hate is what they want. Full control and power. Only silver lining is that they pushing Biden  will destroy him in any debate. I honestly can’t wait. #maga
Trump winning will not surprise me. The DNC is losing the young base and this Biden and Trump is gonna be a showdown to the last state.....new battleground state Texas, Pennsylvania and Florida
Georgia for Biden.    #PresidentBiden
If Biden were smart he’d just shut up and say nothing until November.
Wouldn’t it be great if Biden shocks the world and picks Michelle Obama or Hillary Clinton as his VP?   People would go nuts.
Biden Speach! He had the nerve to say  he never lied to the people! He also gave a platform that repeated the Republican platform! He spent 8 years with Obama supporting a series of lies and biggest one the Ukrain and China deal!#Biden.

Because it’s impossible for Joe Biden to win this election. Either they  tampering or cheated or it shows to the degrees that TDS has reached. That it surpasses all logical and rational minds to vote for a senile man over a healthy one that’s helped this country. Like him or not.
The problem is is that Democrats failed the people as much as the Republicans have. This is a slap in the face and then to have Biden as a candidate lol...Biden will not be a slam dunk win like people think it is. You cannot insult the intelligence of Americans and win
Bernie dropped out in April right? Dems really jumped right to #VoteBlueNoMatterWho and allowed Biden to stay...him for months. This lesser evil voting shit is wack. Months to give us *something* to work with but na. After yesterday I'm sure the next 90+ days will remain a joke.
And COVID,let’s be honest, has worked for Biden in a number of ways. Not as much exposure overall. That said I am terrified he will do something to screw it up as he has in the past.
At the end of the day, Biden will decide who will be his running mate.  This is just background noise.
Kavanaugh isn’t running for President, Trump is.  Who do you think has raped and done more emotional damage to more women, Trump or Biden? Whoch candidate has more strong evidence against them?  Those are the two choices on the ballot.
“Peaceful” Joe Biden supporters out in force attacking Seattle Police.
Another non-emotional, non-melodramatic look at the facts.  Learn the facts and vote in November.  ... and remember, this review which, spoiler alert, shows the power of Biden’s plan, is funded by Republicans who can’t in good conscience vote for Trump.
On the verge of donating $100 to Biden because Trump is just that bad.  (Queue targeted ads...)
you are playing into the current POTUS hands by not pointing out this violence is on his watch not Biden's. The media including yourself once again lowered the bar for this man. What happened to owning a crisis on your watch? Pandemic and protests are his mess
I’m a little scared that Biden went to the Capital. I got a black mask when Trump made fun of his.
I AGREE HOWEVER can we also focus on the fact that all these protests are happening on the POTUS watch and not Biden's? DJT has made them worse he poured gasoline on a simmering fire. Why are we all not blaming him? YOUR WATCH YOUIR FAULT!!!! Do not lower the bar for a President.
What’s Interesting to Me About the Biden VP Pick Speculation
You could have 9999 days to get Joe Biden elected and it will never happen. P. S. Joe Biden has more of a chance of getting elected than you do and Joe Biden has zero chance of getting elected
Same Clowns Who Were Wrong in 2016 Predict Biden, Democrat Sweep
It’s weird that she thinks team Biden would be looking for a bs reason to nix Harris when it would make their donors happy, instead of looking for a bs reason to nix Warren, as the corporate media has clearly been doing.
Meanwhile MSM including Fox keep using polls where Biden is “ahead” of POTUS. Lmfao
Um isn’t Biden being tested? He must have secret service protection by now. He and his staff should be tested like the White House, daily or whatever. Certainly before and after travel.
I mean the whole episode made her look phony because her actual stance on busing isn’t all that different from Biden’s and she still doesn’t have a great response over even simple questions about a debate, let alone her record as prosecutor.
Ukraine? You mean where the Biden’s were using their influence to make millions? Are we just naming scandals now? Fast and Furious? FBI Tea Party? Iran deal? Benghazi? Putin comment on the hot mic? Steel? Holder? Should I keep going?
Idk the inner workings of the DNC so maybe I'm missing something obvious but what's the point of saying they'll vote against the platform but also they'll put $$ towards getting progressives to vote for Biden either way? Seems like they ripped out their teeth before barking 🤦🏾‍♂️

Careful Gary, can't say Trump's name without someone making similarities to Biden 🤦🏼‍♂️. It's time for people to realize to blame those that are spoken of, instead of making them less evil by comparison. You simply spoke of Trump, let's talk Trump. Guess that's hard for some to do.
This wasn't hard all POTUS had to do was follow the science unlike previous leaders in our country this guy really believes he alone can fix it, his philosophy is killing Americans and the  economy. VOTE BIDEN NOV 3

President Trump will go down as one of the greatest presidents in history. He has created a great resurgence of US manufacturing. Something Dems would surely screw up. Joe Biden, what a laugh! Even with our current pandemic the economy is better than Obama ever had.
I don't know where these people are getting these numbers from. I wouldn't vote for Joe Biden, because a vote for Joe Biden is a vote for AOC,ELIZABETH WARREN, BETO O'ROURKE.  And that's just the tip of the iceberg. With all the corrupt actions that they contribute to

Tulsi as vp would definitely make it more palatable for me to vote for Biden.
Biden released decades of tax returns. Where’s Trump’s?
Much like  he'll have staff do it for him. Biden will be too focused on the job to be trolling on twitter.
It’s much easier to sit and critic from the sidelines! I bet Biden doesn’t even remember making that tweet. Actually, I bet he doesn’t even remember what he ate fro breakfast! Wake up and stop supporting rapists and peodphiles thanks

Please get me video of Joe Biden trying to play catch
It's a campaign of hate against  They're setting the stage to treat Biden like they treated Obama. They want a culture of GOP do what they want and Dems can't do anything.
Same reason Biden keeps on sniffing &amp; groping small kids
Obama and Biden.  Geniuses.
If Biden wins the election do you think he will  be in charge or will it be the VP pick or Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer?
Watch any video, within the last several years of Joe Biden. Listen to every word that man says. And tell me with a straight face and honest heart that you believe with all sincerity that he’s fit to run this country.
They tune in because they are Biden campaign ad writers or  fans. Some viewers might tune in because they are studying narcissism and early signs of dementia. Foreign countries watch in order to witness firsthand the sorry state of US leadership.
At least we know that Biden understands what it means to govern. Or understood, if his cognitive ability has indeed plummeted in the last four years. I hope you’re wrong that he will be to the Democrats what GWB was to the Republicans.
If that's the case then why in the hell has Biden, A man who sniffs and gropes children on camera, a man who is clearly mentally unwell up against him? Bidens latest TV outings are just plain sad to watch. These debates are going to be a massacre.
You mean when biden reinstates a huge EV federal credit and does electric charging infrastructure. Yeah... just wait!What if Biden picks another woman at their recommendation?   Still misogyny?
People boycott elections all the time. Its called NOT VOTING.  im all for this btw. Makes Biden's margin of victory larger.
if he quits before the election, he can and will say Biden never beat him.

How Joe Biden got greener - The Washington Post
Who needs logic, right? If you don’t think Biden’s Administration would work with a variety of departments and organizations (especially regarding science, economics, etc) to improve public health and return Americans to the work place, you must not think before you speak.
On election night, even if many votes are not yet counted, we'll still know that you lost the election.  Biden will win by a landslide.  Intelligent Americans are fed up with having an incompetent criminal in the White House.
Postponing the election will cause a longer wait.  We will vote on Nov. 3, whether at the polls or by mail, and we will wait patiently to welcome Joe Biden as our president.  Having to wait for the results doesn't change the outcome.  #Biden2020
It’s plausible Biden will do more for reform &amp; racial tensions than Trump, who has more than sold out to his base who sees not much wrong with enforcement as is. But if he can also listen to experts in many fields on how to get people back to work safely, employment ⬆️ protest ⬇️
One of the main issues now is that federal agents are going after protestors &amp; not just rioters. You could argue it’s just the media perception distributing that, but we’d probably both agree then that the perception would shift when Biden was elected. Biden’s a good corporatist.
I don’t know if your opinion is rooted in fact.  One stance I could take is how Biden vs. Trump would handle the pandemic. If Biden’s admin can quell the virus better than Trump &amp; get people back to work life safely faster than Trump can, unemployment resolved faster &gt; less riots
Sanders won in numerous states (mine included) where exit polls showed he won by a significant margin, while the DP vote count declared Biden the winner. We cannot support a corrupt party that steals elections for 1% psychopaths who would destroy the majority to continue to rule.
The important thing right now is to get Trump out of office and the only way to do that is to vote for Biden. Voting anyone else would be foolish as it would guarantee Trump’s re-election. Political issues are secondary and they can be debated and negotiated once Trump is gone.
#WeWillVote for Vice President Biden!
if he resigns before the election, he can forever say he did not lose to Biden
if he resigns in the next month or so, he can go to his grave telling everyone Biden did not beat him
There will be less rioting  Most of the rioting is happenin from the police anyway. I’m half kiddin, but let’s call tear gassing protestors the fed’s version of “rioting.”  All Biden needs is to people back to working again, &amp; to do even moderate police reform. Workers don’t riot
Not sure where you are getting that 56% number. Mom of 3, voting for Biden and NOT sending my kids to school during this pandemic with Trump as president.  My kids will not be sacrificed.

Trump Can’t Stop the Election, But He Can Threaten Democracy
All Trump needs is a handful of sycophant Govs to delay their elections to sow chaos, and manufacture a crisis.  Imagine GA, FL, NC, AZ  all postpone, and Biden gets to 267 electoral votes on Nov 3.
Trump/gop policies continue to increase deaths.They WANT people to die off to keep control over all.  We can't sit back and watch like a DP that sabotaged the one politician capable of pulling us out of this terrifying mess.  They rig &amp; offer weak unfit Biden. We can't cave. Act.
Sadly troops died under Bush’s misguided wars, &amp; thereafter under the feckless policies of the Obama-Biden Administration.  Several in my family are &amp; were highly decorated military.  Thankfully, none were killed in combat.   In case you didn’t know? It doesn’t snow in Sicily.
Biden's running during an escalation of deaths due to intentionally mismanaged COVID policy. Heard nothing fr Biden to address it, except an adamant refusal to implement &amp; support M4A. This man is unfit on every level, choosing health  industry profit over protecting human lives.
exactly. I hate biden. I’m voting for biden because I hate trump more.
Joe Biden is 4 years OLDER than Bill Clinton.
#WeWillVote and we'll vote for Joe Biden.
Stand up to joe biden. Openly admits to black mailing Ukraine yet you still think Trump who never blackmailed them is bad. “Orange man” bad when a political hack like Mitt Romney who’s bitter about losing is leading your charge. Now that’s pathetic
A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn’t pretty
and Biden's policies to continue depriving the majority of genuine health care &amp; other rights?  DISRESPECTFUL, UNCARING, TOTALLY LACKING COMPASSION.
sorry to be cruel, but Biden has no problem supporting policies that damage the majority to protect corporate greed.
more of Biden's lies and omissions.
what WE can do in response is not vote for Biden.  Write in Sanders.
The vote can't be delayed, so get that out of your desperate little mind.  If you refuse to leave the WH after Biden is sworn in, you'd be trespassing and could be forcibly removed.  I like that.
following back.  but syk I'm not, nor will ever be a Biden supporter.
Why not just resign now?  By doing this Biden will not have beaten him
If you support Biden, you support LAWLESSNESS, the COLLAPSE OF CAPITALISM, &amp; “CHINA’S WORLD DOMINANCE.
I see....so...you're setting the scene for why when you lose by a landslide "it's fake and so you don't  accept!" I see....well...US Marines dragging your fat ass out of President Biden's House might disagree.
Keeping busy is a must.  Walking/exercise is a mood elevator...those endorphins!  Staying in touch with friends and having pleasant conversation.  Comedy movies/TV are a good distraction.  Voting for Biden in Nov. will be the best thing to do for myself.
We hv a moral, ethical responsibility to vote our conscience &amp; for the absolute best person for President. Will never be Biden. Why are these people who normally provide leadership and astute guidance, selling out to an outrageously corrupt bribe-taking DP to sell Biden for 1%?
NOT VOTING FOR BIDEN.
Well, I hope I gave you some motivation. Fact is, Biden isn't "progressive," but his ideology is more in line with the left than a lot of people realize. And this pandemic seems to have pushed him even farther left. He's been sounding like a Big Time Lib since March.
I mean, is it true that Trump is a fucking Lizard monster in an orange human skin-suit who's broken so many laws (with impunity!) that he should be in jail rather than the oval office? Yes. Sorry. I couldn't hold that in anymore. But, I did give you facts on Biden first. Lol
I get paid to do political research &amp; writing, so I'm fairly well-versed on the subject. Yelling never changes minds; facts might. I'm not stoked on Biden--I'm very much registered Dem to vote for progressives, too, but party infighting is what got us into this clusterfuck.
The Senate is gone.  Trump can still pull it out if Biden goes all Biden in the debates
your man who swore to cut SS and Medicare.  Sure Biden isn't a closet far right Republican?  I'm voting Bernie Sanders.
I see you get that Biden will establish some of the same policies/behavior as trump.  Like pretending peaceful protesters are anarchists. And that the Fed troops illegally sent in to Portland are peaceful police.
If Biden is truly ahead in all the polls then ask yourselves why are they pulling their hair out and freaking out so much?
Electing Biden is acceptg fascism. He will change zero. In many states, exit polls showd large discrepancy bet votes for Sanders &amp; Biden. Sanders clearly won in those states yet Biden was declared winner. THAT is Fascism, so is raiding treasury for rich while forcing poor 2 repay
Joe Biden is killing you in the polls.  All your childish insults won't prevent him from winning.  We need an adult in the White House.  Tick tock....
Have you heard ‘Rich Rubino: Biden Veepstakes - Crunch Time’ by Talk of the Commonwealth on #SoundCloud? #np
That was kind of the point. Biden is trying to make it mandatory that low income housing complexes get built into the more affluent suburbs. I spent my whole life in crappy triple deckers in a crap inner city. I don’t think I deserve nice suburbia unless I work my way to it.
Yeah I’m new to the game but the first time I heard Corporatist was when I read an intercept article on him. Honestly if the one good thing Biden does in his administration is legalize pot id consider it one of the best presidencies since eisenhower
Damn if Biden becomes a bad ass president does he become the next Chuck Norris joke?
Truly sad ,whoever is holding Biden to run, they have no shame. The man has problems, let him be released from running for president.
following you but I'm no Biden voter supporter.
Perhaps trying to represent the citizens of Massachusetts may be a novel idea. Trying to continually grandstand yourself to a larger National audience.  YOU losta primary race due to your unlikable persona. To Joe Biden...ugh
Just like rescinding the AFFH rule, which will adversely affect many of his supporters, and repealing the ACA will eliminate medical coverage for thousands of his supporters.  Such a winning strategy....for Biden.

Ah yes Biden the man who totally supports a healthcare plan that will be helpful for all Americans and totally wouldn't doom the most vulnerable demographic of COVID-19 victims
then why hasn't the DP &amp; Biden identified critical issues as part of their DP platform to help people recover from decades long stagnant wages, high cost of essential products, health care bankruptcies, major loss of protest &amp; voting rights, just for a start.
The DP has no intention of moving the country forward.   They intend to maintain the status quo exactly as it is. That's why they shut out Sanders again to  name Biden--in mental decline-- as the primary winner. Will the American ppl allow a bribed DP to get away with this again?
Imagine what they would say if Trump went to a presser with a list of reporters names, the questions each was going to ask, and the answers all written in little index cards.  Even with all that prep, Biden still can't get through it without babbling about nonsense.
Biden is incapable of being an FDR or  a progressive. Bernie Sanders policies picks up where FDR left things. Sanders should be running for President.  I've left the DP for removing him.
Not this time. Biden is well known and people like him. #Vote

I would absolutely *love it* if Biden picked Harris because there is a non-zero chance the VP will be president in this situation
This is quick calculation so could be missing something but if Trump wins Wisconsin and below in this list, wouldn't the Electoral college be tied, and wouldn't the Current House break the tie, thus picking Biden?
Centrists really just see Joe Biden being a racist right in front of their eyes and straight-up choose not to see it

There is no way Joe Biden is actually tweeting. This is a staff member or his wife. She seems to be his handler and the competent brain  of this couple. It is sad to watch his confusion play out so publicly.

Not saying Biden is evil.  He is unfit to serve as president.
What's ironic to me is that Biden is probably the lowest functioning candidate of them all in the 2020 primaries. 🤣

Yeah there hasn’t because joe Biden isn’t a narcissistic attention seeker with psychofantic followers. Joe is a real leader who doesn’t need his ego stroked like you.
5. I am what my aunt calls a “bleeding heart liberal.” I will be voting for Joe Biden in November.
My only counterpoint would be that the networks may pressure him to do it because the ratings would be through the roof.  At this point it has to be a toss up for the Biden campaign. It's bad it they do, bad if they don't. They are just trying to find a credible excuse.
And it starts. Biden wins, and it will be all about cutting spending to take care of the deficit THE REPUBLICANS CREATED.

I would crawl from my deathbed to vote for Joe Biden and save the country I love from your horrible father. Donald Trump is the incompetent. He is corrupt and stupid. I am not  "radical" or "left".  I always voted Republican, as did my entire family. Not this time.
Tell me Who in their right mind will vote for Biden besides PinkHats and Girly Men? No One!
I hate Joe Biden with all my heart
I think that's true. Biden supporters have an emotional drive to do this as well as a rational one if it ends up tamping down criticism. You know Republicans will be complaining about bad coverage so Democrats need to as well. It's working the refs.
If I am an editor do I encourage my reporters to research? Politically cynical things Biden has done? Or crimes against humanity from 45?  How much time should be devoted to each of these things? For every bad thing Biden has done, Trump's done 100. Coverage should match that.
This badly misrepresents the problem. It's not an issue of not reporting facts, it's an editorial question. Which facts? And how much page space or air time to devote to them. Biden had eggs for breakfast. Do we need to know that? Is not reporting on his breakfast self censoring?
He's just going to correct the "Biden has been in government" part and not the rest of that grammatical abomination?
Someone just said Trump thinks he'll catch up during the debates. Really? WHY would Biden even bother to debate, he's already winning? Let Trump continue to sink himself. Every time he opens his stupid mouth he shows who he is and what he knows. Actions speak louder than words.
Again. Does Biden not have his own merits? Separate from Trump?

Biden isn't going to make those changes. He has always been a republic dressed with a D, and for some reason, you believe the democrats are the good guys even though they keep moving further and further right. Biden is a known pathological liar.
The treatment of Bernie and other outsider candidates by the party and their cohorts will drive  many embittered voters to not pull the lever for Biden IMO

Magical thinking. Dangerously negligent. BIDEN 2020
By your "logic" Joe Biden should disqualify himself. He's associated with the Catholic Church for years despite it's "clear history of abuse." But hey, have fun tearing down an accomplished black women with a hit piece sourced to a right wing rag founded by Tucker Carlson.
I live in Mass. I’ve seen project Lincoln commercials and Biden commercials but zero Trump commercials.
Jon, your side was cheated when Bernie didn’t get it. I dislike Bernie’s policies but not him. Seems very affable. Wild as a young Rep, but honest. Very honest. Biden is a freak mannequin bullshit artist. Can’t do it ever.
Heard "9 to 5" on the Biden-Warren call and sighed so heavily that my wife tapped my knee. #WarrenForVP
Biden is sad old dog that wants to sleep all day and pees around the house by accident.
Lololololol.  Biden would have to be left for him to do that. He's far-right.
This dude disgusts me. The fact that settle for Biden is a slogan is so fvcking gross. People like  clearly do not understand why it is we have Trump. Let me tell you. It's Biden.
I think she blew her chances when she attacked Biden during one of the debates. I too believe she wud be great on the ticket but look for Stacey Abrams

Putting the Leftist group she was involved in that went to Cuba in the 70’s aside her endorsement of Scientology is horrifying! Biden can not afford to phuck this up!

absolutely are the parallels between now and late 1920s/early 1930s Germany too on the nose.  Biden is still auth-right.  everyone in this election, and every US election for a century, has been auth-right, except Sanders, maybe Nader, do we get to Teddy for lib-right?

"Evanina (Dir. NCSC) ultimately acknowledged that Russia is again trying to boost President Donald Trump’s reelection and denigrate his opponent, the presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, sources who attended the briefing said."
1. This conversation is about the First Lady. 2. Biden has been concerned about the people of the United States for a lot longer than Twitter has even existed.
I think it is important to keeping a Democrat in the WH that Biden tee up his VP to run in 2024. And for that reason he should pick Kamala Harris
once should keep an eye on senate seats in swing states - MT, NC, GA, IA. If GOP thinks it cannot salvage presidency,  may tinker with senate elections (various ways to cheat and other countries can oblige) to keep senate in their control and obstruct any Biden agenda.
Joe Biden is up by 10 in every poll, though. Why would any of his stans ever care about VP, he's a shoo-in!

As I’ve said before, the debate kerfuffle was always going to be the toughest issue to get over, but she is still going to be the VP candidate.  No one else seems plausible, IMHO.
She is a republican. Don’t spread her trash and let Biden  make his choice..all the women are top notch.

If Biden's VP pick is suppose to succeed him as the next President, it should probably be someone Democrats already want to be President like Warren or Harris. If most voters will need to be introduced to the VP like Tim Kaine was, it's a missed opportunity for Biden.

In terms of the voting blocs in the recent primary, I think Markey will get all of Sanders, much of Warren, and some of Biden. Kennedy will get much of Biden, some of Warren, and none of Sanders. I like Ed’s chances.
I will be draining the swamp by voting for Biden. You are one of the worst U.S. presidents to sit in the oval office. The only Americans you have helped are your rich friends. We are voting you out in November!
I've decided that Harris would be the dumbest possible VP pick, because the only ones it would please are people like this guy, who can't even JOKE about making demands of Biden without adding a disclaimer assuring the reader that he didn't really mean it and will do as told

Yep. When the Dems picked Biden I was like you have got to be fucking kidding me, we’re going to end up with 4 more years of Donald fucking Trump, aren’t we.
I’m not speaking to it’s quality, just the drop for Biden is interesting and noteworthy.  Also I’m out on 538, their analyses in 2016 were awful (not necessarily their fault).

Aka slime creature lobbyists are pissed because if Biden dies in office she will be potus and not cater to them. They’re very predictable. Old white dudes should retire this year. Go away. You’re wittingly and unwittingly destroying this country
Polling among all age groups also finds strong opposition to abortion without restriction up to birth and taxpayer-funded abortions — the position that Biden now holds.
Joe Biden is struggling to reach religious voters. It’s hardly a surprise. Biden is a pro-abortion Democrat who opposes religious freedom – even for nuns — and wants to force taxpayers to pay for abortions.
`That was my first thought but you know, if you don’t vote, you don’t vote. If Biden wins, I’m fine with them sitting around the trailer park, crowing about how Trump would have won if...   Works for me.

That awkward moment when you’re in such pure shock from reading the words “Joe Biden” and “further left” in the same sentence that you don’t even finish reading the sentence correctly
“Joe Biden is further left than Bernie Sanders” is certainly a take
He said  “she’s 12 I’ve never been into that”
There are so many women who are prepared, experienced, highly capable, to lead this country and be potus. I’m not sure why you demand anything like this. I’m sure Biden knows his choice is important if something happens to him. Younger ppl die. JFK, Bobby Kennedy were murdered.
Bernie Sanders and AOC are already on record supporting this maggot's right to vote. Does their marionette, Joe Biden, agree? Better question: Will he ever be asked?
Yup. And ironically their solution is Joe “You know, the thing” Biden.

"Joe Biden is far to the left of Bernie Sanders" might be the most ludicrous thing Donald Trump has said all day so far.
As usual, Trump supporters find ways to attack Biden, but never have a single positive Trump accomplishment to talk about. That's because there are none.
The video presentation during the Barr bearings prompted rhis no doubt. The democrats hate to see their agenda foiled by somerhing like video proof. The democrats had the same reaction when Biden was seen on video bragging about his quid pro quo violation.

A vote for Biden is a vote for China
Brown didnt “severely hamper” anything. He was notable only for having one time been a centerfold. He didnt do anything particularly controvesial and cast no swing votes.  The ACA was “hampered” by scared centrists that Biden as VP was able to push over the line.
Republicans want a stimulus extension of $1T. Democrats want more than $3T. If Biden is elected, and the Dems get control of both the Upper and Lower houses, get ready for extreme fiscal imprudence, and consequently, the implosion of the USD.
Joe Biden is president?
NYT article predicts Representative Karen Bass for VP, and explains why. If Joe thinks so, sounds good to me  😃
Hi, as an actual Mass resident, I can tell you it is 100% safe. The seat can be filled on Nov 3, and Brown was the first R senator in MA since the 1970’s.  I notice you say “almost” quite a lot as while ignoring it DID happen, in part bc VP Biden was whipping votes.
Things f'ing exploded all right, and we still wanted Biden over Bernie four years later. I'll never forgive you,

They will manufacture “dirt” &amp; intentionally mislead. Barr will hold a press conf to deliver the msg they want. That will flood social media. Look at the crap abt Benghazi even after all the investigatns. The goal is to sway trump voters leaning twd Biden. If they’re still alive.
They know NUNES, GRAHAM, GRASSLEY and others received such packages of smut about Biden purportedly to make up will be used to create the"OCTOBER SURPRISE"leading Republicans are openly discussing,which means it's going to be underwhelming in impact but full of bullshit inuendo!
I'd like to co-sign as a white woman. The coverage of VP Biden's potential running mates is infuriating, particularly in the wake of 2016. Advisors/donors who are speaking &amp; leaking are hurting JB. They're not on his side, nor the country's. They're self-interested.
In his Biden interview, Ady Barkan reflected on the nominee's proposed budget for the NIH stating simply "I don't think that's enough." Watching him always moves me, but Ady having found in  someone whose "optimism and perseverance" ARE enough nearly brought me to tears.

So bad....I’ve tried to see things from the other side and I just can’t figure out their thought process. Bottom line is that they will do anything and everything to get him out of office. If he is voted back in, it will be 4 more years of the same. And Biden? God help us.

Biden’s wife should be charged with Elder abuse!!!
They can all go to hell, especially after Clinton having 3 million more votes in 2016. They inflicted this 4-year trauma on all of us, let them stew in their own paranoid delusions for the next 4-years while Biden and Democrats get shit done.
YES!!!!! If this is indeed the case I don’t think we’ll be seeing Donnie hanging around. He hates Joe Biden but he DEESSPIISES Nancy Pelosi.
Suddenly I’m less hopefully about the Veepstakes and feel so deflated.   Kamala has been working her ass off for Biden and to see her potentially derailed by weak white men threatened by her ambition is awful.    and  showed the type of people they are.
Not close to excited. I thought for sure Kamala now I am back to thinking Liz Warren give the very public bashing Kamala got from people close to Biden this week
But I feel like if you have to explain that I knew her at 12 and she was so “beautiful” (not pretty like most 12 yos are described) He was struck by it then say but when she turned 25... wink wink - still pervy
I agree with this. If I’m Biden I’m going with Harris and if not Harris then Duckworth. No reason to overthink it.   I love Warren but with things going the way they are (big lead, national pandemic) there’s no reason to give Trump &amp; his team such an obvious target / distraction
Trump administration does not even have to have chart every day Obama Biden during the swine clue refused to report cases because they said it was a pandemic and people where going to Die!!! Trump can even stop mass ted
and this is on top of all the voter suppression that Democrats let Republicans get away with uncontested because it helped Biden win the primary
So you're saying people can get free healthcare and still hate brown people? if you're planning on giving the South to Biden in November this is a good start
Free legal advice, first one to start snacking does not die in federal prison. I suggest you get to Biden's attorney general and make a deal before Devin Nunes does

JFC, at least people know who Kamala Harris is. Karen Bass has no name recognition outside her district and the beltway. Meanwhile both of these women are from a California, a state Biden will win easily.  I’m so disappointed that Stacey Abrams isn’t being talked about now.
Good, she should rub everyone the wrong way. Nobody gets to anyone without friction. And they're so worried about what she is capable of, it's beyond transparent

Trump administration honestly said that it was gonna be awful if Biden takes off it will be worse
trump supporters: 👩‍🦯
Not to mention, I make comments like this and not a single reply from Biden's social media team. It is as if they are using Twitter to lecture instead of engage with their audience – which is the purpose of the platform.
I do not plan to vote for Trump. As a marketer, Biden's marketing is just so horrible. None of his social appears remotely close to his own voice. And Marketing 101 is not to mention your competition – it just amplifies their voice. Worried about Biden's ability to communicate.
boy you aren't kidding. I have been noticing that they have been actively campaigning harder against Biden than actual Trumpers. Very "progressive" of them.
honestly didn’t give enough credit to people’s ability to see right through JK3 so this is a nice recovery from the nihilism I got from watching puppets dragging Biden across the finish line
Thought we were talking about Biden&amp;Trump here. Calling it for what it is...is not hateful. Keeping quiet on Dems unending relentless pursuit to get rid ofTrump ever since he stepped into office &amp;yet pretending to be the victims when conservatives fight back. Don’t instigate then
I really don’t think most voters will care about that. Plus I don’t think her Castro comments are that bad and even still Biden’s the top of the ticket and is clearly doing well in Florida.   Also Kamala living in Canada for years is a vulnerability that hasn’t been tapped yet.
Biden isn't in the video. You'd think a presidential candidate would share his presidential action plans instead of running on the platform: The current president stinks.
I think the media is the one dragging this out. He already said months ago that he would make his decision in early August. They've been covering potential picks nonstop since Bernie dropped out of the race. I don't think that's Biden's fault. My 2 cents.
They're for anything that is corrupt! You would have to be brain dead to vote DemonRat.  Unless you want all your cities to a lawless jungle. If Demonrat voters could take a glimpse into the future if Biden was elected, they would regret it every day that they lived. 💯%FACT!!
Look at most recent CNBC poll.  Biden’s leads in battleground states have evaporated in ~1 week.  This election season has barely even started.The Dems have no message, instead Biden is stealing POTUS' message(s). The bring the fear mongers,domestic terrorists:BLM,Antifa hoping to scare Americans in to caving to their demands. They use race baiting,name calling. This is why Trump won&amp;will again!!
Biden requested early access to briefings, when it was clear trump was doing nothing about the bounties on our soldiers. The national security team has zero reason to withhold anything from the former VP/senator.
Val Demings is high on my list. No VP candidates are perfect. If not VD for Biden’s VP, then certainly for another position in Biden’s Cabinet. Of course I feel similarly about Biden’s other women candidates. They are all intelligent, accomplished, flexible &amp; good women 💛👍🍀🤞
I mean, the pictures of Joe Biden kneeling, with a mask, all sunny around him, outstretching his hands to grace a Black child. It's fuckin' "I'm your savior" propaganda. If he were a little more religiously based, he would probably pass himself off as the second Christ.
It won't be dangerous in Biden's America,  it's dangerous in Trump's America right now....

The double standard has gone beyond what I believe would happen. This is a funeral for a great man who gave a lot to improve the life of American citizens. Obama, Biden, and the leader of Congress turned It into a biased political platform. Do we get it now?
Your willingness to publicly debase yourself for Biden for no real reason suggests you're not as ambivalent about him as you're pretending to be
Biden should be #45 , not 46, as #44 was the last one we had. .. the last 3.5 years have been devoid of a president.
Alright cool, but if they impeach him, isn't it gonna be pence vs Biden?
Trumpism is dangerous - it’s illiberal, antithetical to conservatism and anti-intellectual at its core. Biden/Rice is the most competent ticket. Keep in mind I’m not wild about Dem economic policy - it will literally hit me in the wallet- Trumpism is THAT dangerous. End
I support Joe Biden because he, for all his faults, puts us back on the path to normalcy. Where policy debates matter and thus populist, nationalist, isolationist Trumpism is repudiated. Bring out a Paul Ryan or Ben Sasse in 2024. 2/
He’s already doing it. A tight 20-minute Rally speech at Texas Oil.  High energy. Concise.  I don’t know about August, but whoever gets the earlier start sets the table. I suspect Biden will drop his VP this week(?) and start the engines for, as the kids say, realsies.  Buckle up
What’s on? The Election?  If Biden makes a splash with his already-later-than-Hillary-did-it-in-2016 VP announcement, Trump will have to keep up amid the hype.

I know who I’m voting for, don’t believe you understand who you’re voting for though. If you look at the bills put forth by Biden before VP he isn’t for the American people he’s for Biden’s wallet
Yea Biden’s been accused by numerous women too but the main difference is there’s actual proof of Biden, and it’s clear as day the corruption within that man. Who also freely threw the N word around during senate hearings. Full blown racist! But hey yea have fun with the election
So many good candidates. And we are poised to have Biden and Kamala. Not surprised we are gonna have Trump for another 4 years ......

that's going to happen to some degree, and it's gonna suck, but I can't imagine Biden being as effective in that role as Obama or Trudeau. There's no Bidenmania outside of dark and twisted CAP twitter and the current protesters don't view him as any kind of ally or leader.
You are a moron from A to Z.. Your secret agents were sent packing today...So please cut the dictator crap..knock it off..Is this supposed to impress your cult followers to vote for you..Your loosing so bad to Biden..US marshalls will drag you out Nov 4th..or be a man and leave
If Biden is our next president, the four loudmouths will be running the country.
if Democrats grab hold of the senate in November AND it’s Biden as president.. gonn be a lot of anti trust suits and divesting for these tech bros
There's a lot going on but it seems fucked up for a Joe Biden outfit to do a meme calling a woman a fucking bitch. I know the reference, and if she wanted to appropriate phrase fine, but otherwise this feels gross.
It should be unbelievable but after four years of lunacy, it's sadly not. #Biden
Barack Obama got over this and selected Joe Biden as his VP.
Remember this? "I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy," Biden said. "I mean, that's a storybook, man" 2007
Not in Joe Biden’s America
Can  replace Biden in the 2020 elections? Like forreal.
#donoharm #vppick as #Hillary did is #AMISTAKE #Biden be bold enough to pick a younger woman who is unafraid to speak her mind. Not withstanding the #fiasco of #sarahpallin this is different. Biden will be a one term president and the vp pick must be able to take over right now!
I haven't stepped foot in a Walmart since the early 90s. Once more for the back of the room -- there is VERY LITTLE evidence of mail in voter fraud. Troops have voted that way for decades. And Biden will win whether there's mail in or in person voting.
Lol i kinda thought this site was trying to be an alternative to the piss on our leg and tell us it's raining approach of other Biden outlets but they still pull the "most progressive platform in history" shit:
I believe she will be black, Matt. And I’m with you. Biden’s got my vote. He’ll prob be announcing next week I’ve heard.
Obama SLIPS Reveals The Plan For A Joe Biden Presidency | Huckabee's Bre...  via
Definitely a good faith interpretation of Biden's statement from you. 🙄
I’m seeing a lot of takes today about how Biden and the Democrats fucking blow (and they do, they really do) but it seems to me the socialist Left has not figured out how to make inroads with the older black voters who propelled him to victory.
If I was the President I would make sure that my campaign would concentrate on these riots. Dopey Joe figures that if he gets elected these attacks will stop. They will not, they will get worse because Biden lacks the spine to stand up to them.
Biden just said he would pick his VP next week. It was supposed to be Saturday. Just pick someone Joe. I can’t take this nonsense anymore.
Biden/Harris or Biden/Demmings works for me
Tuning in but VP Biden is on??
This TV ad is going out in HOUSTON while the Biden campaign figures out whether or not to spend $ in Texas.
Biden is too risky! Perhaps my most inventive way to get him off the ticket, knowing the DNC will never accept Bernie, is replace w/Markey w/Demmings as running mate--a sure win ticket, with working class roots! Enables Kennedy to get Markey's senate seat.
This morning, I walked outside and the first person I saw said “I love your shirt - Go Joe!”  Turns out she was a Bernie supporter in the primary and is super excited about Joe’s Build Back Better plan!! 98 days until Election Day! #LFG  #TeamJoe #StudentsforBiden #Biden #mapoli
Your next! Keep up your nonsense and you'll join your son..Everytime you tweet nasty messages..Voter supression on vote by mail ballots or bashing Joe Biden for your demented voter supression rants..I will report it to Twitter..This is Our Election.
Dunno what I expected from people who told me someone as plainly and mindlessly cruel as Joe Biden was some kind of empathy savant
Those #Anifa #terrorists should be in jail for life. All an example of the current destructive nature of the #Democrat party from #Biden and #Pelosi. #Portland
Yes they will return if pedo #racist #Biden will be elected.
Voting for Biden? Good luck with that! 😂
PLEASE I ASK YOU TO REVIEW DONALD-S TRUMPS OVERNIGHT TWEETS ON DEM CANDIDATE JOE BIDEN AND HIS BASHING OF THE PORTLAND PROTESTERS..PLEASE I ASK YOU MR.DORSSEY TO REMOVE OR SUSPEND DONALD TRUMPS TWITTER ACCOUNT TODAY TUESDAY...THIS IS ABUSE OF HIS ACCOUNT AND OTHERS.
If Biden gets elected we will have rioting in the streets 145,000 dead from the Covid 52 million unemployed $1 trillion deficit oh no that’s for Trump is already done to the country. Biden 2020
No employees that I know of? A lot of former Beto for President people are now working for Biden though. Beto did an event online earlier this summer to endorse Kennedy. After that, a bunch of us wanted to do a weekly phonebank and postcarding events for Joe.
Just donated to show my support for a Biden/Warren ticket in November! Please consider donating to the fundraiser and show the #FutureisProgressive #WarrenForVP #WarrenDemocrats  . . .
Congress should fact check you and subpeona you to a lie detector exam..and then get your resignation Your a screw up..Biden will end your crime spree..you can count on it!
keep thinking about how Joe Biden wouldn't let Ady Barkan do an endorsement video for him without humiliating the guy in a show of callousness that rivaled many of the worst displays of the Trump presidency
"Despite their frustration with Biden, progressive leaders behind the pledge all said they are voting for Biden and working to elect him."  this doesn't feel like how you make a serious fight for a thing
Biden is owned by China. He even has “Made in China” branded on his ass. Not just him but “Baby Biden” the feckless Hunter.
You really are in ignorant and heartless soul..racist as well. Your horrible  Your loss.. Though you never visited with surviving covid family members..See this is why your loosing..Joe Biden is so beyond you
Good grief.. Can’t stand this narrative. Sit down with Biden? Be good for the brand and the country.
A vote for trump is literally dangerous and treasonous Trump supporters and voters should be charged with treason and/or locked up in homes for the deranged and mentally dangerous. No one really wants Biden but it’s either politics as usual or the end of days.
Besides, i'm not saying DON'T pay attention but rather take in from all sources, don't expect this to come out the way that the polls indicate, there are plenty of days in between, and to work people to Biden.
Well, f**k them then. Listen to the people,   There's reportedly a 'contingent' of Democrats lobbying against Kamala Harris as Biden's running mate
Well, Todd is one of those "anonymous donor" types that was in the background pushing Biden to run. It's not terribly surprising, but it's ridiculous to listen to him.
Obama didn't announce Biden as his pick until August 23rd, fwiw
Biden campaign picking up some the best talent Massachusetts has to offer! Congratulations Chelsey!
But he didn’t. He tried to tear Beto down on technicalities. Everyone knows that both Castro &amp; Beto care very deeply about this topic. That’s why Beto folks shunned Castro after. When he went after Biden’s age, it solidified the perception that he was there to drag down others.
I was disappointed in the way that Castro treated Beto &amp; Biden on the the debate stages. If he united with Beto that Texas is a battleground state &amp; that they’re going to work together to make sure people are treated with dignity and respect at the border would have been amazing!
If Biden doesn’t win I’m buying a gun !
Between Trump and Biden..... i dont even think im registered to vote....regardless of who wins i feel like itll be my fault.... yikes
There are so many weird narratives about Harris. Some white dudes questioning her "loyalty" is absolute patriarchal (and racist) bullshit and then putting forth other women &amp; calling on them to be "loyal"?? 🙄
Forget Ilhan if Trump or Hillary or Bush or Biden had said anything close to this they would have been forced to resign already
Shove your roses..Tell your dictator husband he's done. Out of touch with reality.. Too bad you won't see those roses mature..seeing you'll be out in 98 days..Jill Biden will take over
I honestly can't think of a more important choice we need to make. •  Creamy or Crunchy PB? •  Pizza or Chinese Take-out? •  Bellini or Bloody Caeser?  NO.  Biden or trump.  VOTE FOR BIDEN 🇺🇸.
just curious why these are joe biden’s protests but they’re happening in trumps america 🥵🤭
Don’t worry, their union backed Sleepy Joe and they’ll do all they can to continue the fraudulent mail in voting.I just got my mail in application in the mail. And I also got one for the dead woman who lived at my house 10 years ago. What could go wrong
Yeah, okay, you got me here. I'm still voting for Ed Markey, and I still wish Joe Biden wasn't the nominee, but this is hypocritical of me
Wso you support #racism by #Biden, and the #antisemitic anti #Jew agenda of the #Democrat party with embracing #terrorists like #IlhanOmar and #Tlaib? You embrace the defunding of the #police and the mass killings it caused already among #blacks and #latino?
There is only one hateful party and one #racist #antisemitic party and its the #Democrat party. They think they own the #blacks #latino #gays #Jews and fortunately they are all walking away because more and more people see the destructive agenda of the #Democrats and pedo #Biden
A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn’t pretty  via
It feels kinda weird that Harris was allowed to get away with the 'dont attack biden' rule during the primaries. Not even Sanders broke it. They went after Castro hard for skirting around it. Like... did she get permission or something?
That is the right answer.  Relief till Biden takes office.  Don’t need another round of $1200 check.  Democrats can give on that.
Anthony, when are you going to do a Biden commercial ?
So he gets to pick and choose what is his fault or not? Is he responsible for the five largest daily drops in history, or is that on Biden for leading in the polls?
Did you just say on a national news show that “people are thinking about Kanye West as a viable option” because they don’t believe in Joe Biden?    Wow. Just wow.
You think the Catholics at the 4 pm Saturday Mass at Holy Name are voting majority Biden?
Voting for anyone but Biden is selfish &amp; stupid? People caving in to DP election theft &amp; allowing  manipulation of our votes for an unfit, in mental decline centrist with US in chaos &amp; an intentionally botched management of a deadly pandemic is stupid. DP lost r trust allegience.
Ok dude. I hope Biden wins. I hope he wins.
Get involved with the Biden Campaign or a local down ballot race.
Voting for Biden. I lived through nine presidents now and I have never seen America so torn apart by disease, unemployment, corporate greed, historical Republican corruption, and police beating peaceful protesters, trumps America sucks
He is the worst prospect ever!! We know who will be most likely be his running mate. Obama bc he still thinks he's POTUS,Michelle to carry out her&amp;Obama's hate of Americans,Clinton bc they both have kinship to the KKK personally having close ties w/SenByrd

Democrats are determined to destroy the country. Don’t vote for Biden or we will be well on our way for our country you won’t even recognize anymore.
You are funny and insincere like Joe Biden.  lol.
I hope people realize that if Biden doesn’t get elected then the other candidate wins. Do we really want that????!!! #youstillneedtovote #dontwithholdyourvote #notvotingisnotanoption #learnfrom2016
Hi Malcolm..  I would but can't because we have to wait to post Biden signs 35 days before Election Day in North Weymouth Mass We posted a Black lives Matter sign in our living room window and my sister in law told us to remove it because she feared vandals would damage house
Thank god Steve..I just want to throw up at the same time..Lifetime democrat.. I was old enough to see Kennedy that fateful day in Dallas..Our world is upside down..I hate carnival rides..Joe Biden is our saving grace.. God bless you.
Ye giving Biden that Gluck Gluck 9000
Every time he says something stupid I donate to a democratic race somewhere in the country or to Biden. It reduces my anxiety.
Your a POS..your propaganda video of Biden defunding the police is utter garbage like you..Grow up.. No one is listening to you..no one cares You have no one..Its in americans hands now to remove you from Office..Can't wait! Tell your family to pack up!

“But but but, Joe Biden has declined the platform set forth by Bernie and the  Democrats! No! You will NOT attempt to tie Slow Joe to his own Party’s legislative strategy! NO!”
(1)if they are logical there wouldn’t be 12 of them. Logical choices would be like 2-3 of them (1)Your top 3 are NOT logical and do 0 for Biden in his campaign. Rice, your #4, is the most logical.
If trump had intelligence to go with his brazen authoritarianism, I'd be a lot more worried. Worst possible thing is they kick him out on a 25th amendment and Mike Pence ends up running against Joe Biden.
JOE BIDEN WHAT ARE YA HIDIN’
When did Obama ever relate to American families? He related with the Muslim refugees better,they got everything that most Americans didn't get. Relatable,no he wasn't bc to Obama,whites struggling as much as Black inner cities didn't matter&amp;he's racist!!
Why are libs ignoring the fact the Biden can’t even do an interview on his own
Enthusiasm for Biden is lower than polls suggest. Trump is running on Economy. If we’re in a better spot in November than today on Economy, Healthcare (including the Virus) etc... Americans won’t have the incentive for a big shakeup. We like continuity. Trump creates balance too.
From political stand point: Sucks. (Favorite person I don’t know, hanging with least favorite person I don’t know.) From a Stoolie stand point: Wow! Awesome. I hope Biden gets a slice too.
Wasn’t he a friend of Joe Biden when he entered the Senate.
I think big cat is in the middle of pft and dave. But they had fauci on and hes become a political lightning rod, the leftys all over barstool have no problem giving there opinion, the double standard is gross and btw dave would interview biden, he doesnt care.
Exactly I'm sure dave would interview biden, dave doesnt care hes non political
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  Can you say, President Biden? 👍🏾🇺🇲🇺🇲
I struggle with the logic we see in which “Trump does something minor and loses massive portions of his base or traditional GOP support... to Joe Biden.” Or “people mad that Trump isn’t doing enough of the things Biden claims are fascist/racist will vote Biden instead.” Nonsense.
Desperate much,  ?  Laura Ingraham: "If Biden wins in November, the Democrats and their rioters allies will turn their sights on you"

I’m not going to defend and race baiting rhetoric that may have been said in the past - that stuff drives me insane.  Biden lying through is teeth? You are really going to make lying an issue between these two candidates?  Watch less Foxnews, Ben.
I know you want to defend trump at all costs. Trump verifiably said there were “very fine people on both sides” in Charlottesville...  You seem to be alluding to financial impropriety with Biden but I know of no ethics violations. Republicans like Lindsey have lauded his decency
I’m attending Joe Biden for President’s event, “Neponset Valley for Biden Phone Bank” – sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
As a life long Democrat I’m not disparaging Joe Biden.  I’m thinking of the time leading up to the Election and the weeks before Biden’s inauguration.  Democrats are good for “The Rich” but they seem to forget that on Election Day.  Democrats are also good at cleaning up after Rs
Joe Biden quotes                                    “A hadith from the Prophet Muhammad instructs, ‘Whomever among you sees a wrong, let him change it with his hand,’” Biden quoted. “‘If he is not able, then with his tongue. If he is not able, then with his heart.’”
Just like 2016 with #Clinton. Who is going to really vote for the #pedo #racist #antisemitic #Biden party: #Democrats ?
Joe Biden will refill his son’s pockets with CHINESE cash if elected! Also Twitter Sucks

That is a beautiful W but upper limit may be to low.  Or maybe we get a lightening bolt⚡️top for VIX.  Valuations getting noticed, Biden victory coming closer, Fall COVID-19 bump from a higher base, China friction/war, Iran/Israel/Saudi Arabia.  One or all of the above. Shit show
Maybe if you wanted trump out the dems should have gotten a better candidate. Biden just based on policies he has endorsed is a worse choice
I'm with josh here, never seen him speak well of biden at all, on Twitter or In person.
Yeah, hence the polls of Obama vs you, and Biden vs you. You know, watch closely because when you are an ex-president, sitting in a federal cell, nobody will be looking your endorsement.
Leakary, that is because Biden cannot pass one.  Why would you brag about not remembering your own address?  Would you brag about not being able to pass a balance test?
Yeah &amp; Biden is completely coherent. Two equal truths.
Biden might have a black women as his running mate 👀

Biden called Trump the first racist president? Has he read a history book?
Biden wants to forgive student loans, increase loan forgiveness, make public colleges free for anyone making &lt; $125k, make CCs free, &amp; double the Pell Grant. Only the last of these had any merit to it.

I knew that he would fall back on outdated democratic thought. Rendell has no idea who are party is now. Biden thinks the old boy club is going to help him/
This is what I worried about with Biden. He should not be listening to Rendell or Dodd. They have not been in tune with the Democratic Party or the country for years. Our base is progressive.

Pretty sad that this is the most coherent statement to come from Biden this year.
We all know it’s going to happen Because theres NO way in hell Biden would win without it
So Biden will be Her running mate now Have you seen his latest forget where I am gaffe He Honestly is an Idot and has Dementia
For all or you supporting Sleepy Joe Biden You should go have your head examined before November
No, Biden needs to drop out he is unwell and unfit for president but if you want to lose freedom then go ahead and vote for a Republican or a Democrat
Ya, and Biden ain't Hilary... can't wait to hear you screaming bullshit conspiracies when your hero's ass gets kicked to the curb

I’m more afraid that you will make a whole truck load of Biden votes disappear in swing states so that you can win. Cheating is the only chance you have of winning
I think Trump’s going to stick it out, I think they’re cooking up Obamagate, probably announce it mid September. If he loses, and I hope Biden wins in a landslide, I see him resigning and have Pence pardon him.
You have to agree it would make for Great Humor to watch Biden Crumble even when he gets the questions before hand
Another old stupid comeback I said Find something new hahahahaha Trumps been the best President Since Reagan Biden can never do what it takes to be President Even You Dems know that Can’t wait for the Debates Although we all know Biden won’t do it and The Party won’t let him
You honestly believe that incompetent Idiot Biden should be President ? And do better than Trump has done for this economy and the Americans people 😂😂😂😂😂 that says it all about you Best 3 years all while being attacked by the left since he before he was even inaugurated

Old White men who Joe Biden shouldn't be listening to. This is whi I worried about him. He's a still in the old boys club.

I honestly don’t think Biden will ever Debate Trump anyway It will just help seal his fate as an incompetent candidate on National Television I hope and Pray he does though it’ll be very entertaining and hilarious to watch him stumble and mumble his way and not make any sense
That’s bullshit This is exactly what the Democrats want They don’t want Biden Debating Trump Live in stage They know he’ll get laughed off of it It’s going to be a humiliating embarrassment for Biden more so than the many embarrassing things he’s been doing for months now

Have you ever watched videos of Biden since the day he became a politician 40plus years ago Google them see for yourself He’s a Lyer a Plagiarist a Racist and in those 40 years including with Racist Obama for 8 years has done nothing for the people especially Blacks Check it out

I got the impression Biden was pointing out people are blaming any Asian for the virus. I would agree Koreans, Japanese, Vietnamese are all catching flak because of Trump naming this the Chinese virus.
As a life long Democrat I’m not disparaging Joe Biden.  I’m thinking of the time leading up to the Election and the weeks before Biden’s inauguration.  Democrats are good for “The Rich” but they seem to forget that on Election Day.  Democrats are also good at cleaning up after Rs
I LOVE how R's are using pictures of TRUMP'S 'Merica! to scare voters into making the same mistake twice! "LOOK AT WHAT JOE BIDEN WILL DO!" Bitch, YOU already done DID it!
That is a beautiful W but upper limit may be to low.  Or maybe we get a lightening bolt⚡️top for VIX.  Valuations getting noticed, Biden victory coming closer, Fall COVID-19 bump from a higher base, China friction/war, Iran/Israel/Saudi Arabia.  One or all of the above. Shit show

How Joe Biden got greener - The Washington Post
Who needs logic, right? If you don’t think Biden’s Administration would work with a variety of departments and organizations (especially regarding science, economics, etc) to improve public health and return Americans to the work place, you must not think before you speak.
On election night, even if many votes are not yet counted, we'll still know that you lost the election.  Biden will win by a landslide.  Intelligent Americans are fed up with having an incompetent criminal in the White House.
Postponing the election will cause a longer wait.  We will vote on Nov. 3, whether at the polls or by mail, and we will wait patiently to welcome Joe Biden as our president.  Having to wait for the results doesn't change the outcome.  #Biden2020
It’s plausible Biden will do more for reform &amp; racial tensions than Trump, who has more than sold out to his base who sees not much wrong with enforcement as is. But if he can also listen to experts in many fields on how to get people back to work safely, employment ⬆️ protest ⬇️
One of the main issues now is that federal agents are going after protestors &amp; not just rioters. You could argue it’s just the media perception distributing that, but we’d probably both agree then that the perception would shift when Biden was elected. Biden’s a good corporatist.
I don’t know if your opinion is rooted in fact.  One stance I could take is how Biden vs. Trump would handle the pandemic. If Biden’s admin can quell the virus better than Trump &amp; get people back to work life safely faster than Trump can, unemployment resolved faster &gt; less riots
Sanders won in numerous states (mine included) where exit polls showed he won by a significant margin, while the DP vote count declared Biden the winner. We cannot support a corrupt party that steals elections for 1% psychopaths who would destroy the majority to continue to rule.
The important thing right now is to get Trump out of office and the only way to do that is to vote for Biden. Voting anyone else would be foolish as it would guarantee Trump’s re-election. Political issues are secondary and they can be debated and negotiated once Trump is gone.
#WeWillVote for Vice President Biden!
There will be less rioting  Most of the rioting is happenin from the police anyway. I’m half kiddin, but let’s call tear gassing protestors the fed’s version of “rioting.”  All Biden needs is to people back to working again, &amp; to do even moderate police reform. Workers don’t riot

Trump Can’t Stop the Election, But He Can Threaten Democracy
All Trump needs is a handful of sycophant Govs to delay their elections to sow chaos, and manufacture a crisis.  Imagine GA, FL, NC, AZ  all postpone, and Biden gets to 267 electoral votes on Nov 3.
Trump/gop policies continue to increase deaths.They WANT people to die off to keep control over all.  We can't sit back and watch like a DP that sabotaged the one politician capable of pulling us out of this terrifying mess.  They rig &amp; offer weak unfit Biden. We can't cave. Act.
Biden's running during an escalation of deaths due to intentionally mismanaged COVID policy. Heard nothing fr Biden to address it, except an adamant refusal to implement &amp; support M4A. This man is unfit on every level, choosing health  industry profit over protecting human lives.
exactly. I hate biden. I’m voting for biden because I hate trump more.

#WeWillVote and we'll vote for Joe Biden.
A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn’t pretty
and Biden's policies to continue depriving the majority of genuine health care &amp; other rights?  DISRESPECTFUL, UNCARING, TOTALLY LACKING COMPASSION.
sorry to be cruel, but Biden has no problem supporting policies that damage the majority to protect corporate greed.
more of Biden's lies and omissions.
what WE can do in response is not vote for Biden.  Write in Sanders.
The vote can't be delayed, so get that out of your desperate little mind.  If you refuse to leave the WH after Biden is sworn in, you'd be trespassing and could be forcibly removed.  I like that.
following back.  but syk I'm not, nor will ever be a Biden supporter.
Keeping busy is a must.  Walking/exercise is a mood elevator...those endorphins!  Staying in touch with friends and having pleasant conversation.  Comedy movies/TV are a good distraction.  Voting for Biden in Nov. will be the best thing to do for myself.
We hv a moral, ethical responsibility to vote our conscience &amp; for the absolute best person for President. Will never be Biden. Why are these people who normally provide leadership and astute guidance, selling out to an outrageously corrupt bribe-taking DP to sell Biden for 1%?
NOT VOTING FOR BIDEN.
Well, I hope I gave you some motivation. Fact is, Biden isn't "progressive," but his ideology is more in line with the left than a lot of people realize. And this pandemic seems to have pushed him even farther left. He's been sounding like a Big Time Lib since March.
I mean, is it true that Trump is a fucking Lizard monster in an orange human skin-suit who's broken so many laws (with impunity!) that he should be in jail rather than the oval office? Yes. Sorry. I couldn't hold that in anymore. But, I did give you facts on Biden first. Lol
I get paid to do political research &amp; writing, so I'm fairly well-versed on the subject. Yelling never changes minds; facts might. I'm not stoked on Biden--I'm very much registered Dem to vote for progressives, too, but party infighting is what got us into this clusterfuck.
The Senate is gone.  Trump can still pull it out if Biden goes all Biden in the debates
your man who swore to cut SS and Medicare.  Sure Biden isn't a closet far right Republican?  I'm voting Bernie Sanders.
I see you get that Biden will establish some of the same policies/behavior as trump.  Like pretending peaceful protesters are anarchists. And that the Fed troops illegally sent in to Portland are peaceful police.
If Biden is truly ahead in all the polls then ask yourselves why are they pulling their hair out and freaking out so much?
Electing Biden is acceptg fascism. He will change zero. In many states, exit polls showd large discrepancy bet votes for Sanders &amp; Biden. Sanders clearly won in those states yet Biden was declared winner. THAT is Fascism, so is raiding treasury for rich while forcing poor 2 repay
Joe Biden is killing you in the polls.  All your childish insults won't prevent him from winning.  We need an adult in the White House.  Tick tock....

This doesn't surprise me. Tlaib has the power of her convictions, but too often lacks judgment. Some good ideas, but frequently counterproductive actions/comments. Also, this would not be forgotten in a Biden Administration.
then why hasn't the DP &amp; Biden identified critical issues as part of their DP platform to help people recover from decades long stagnant wages, high cost of essential products, health care bankruptcies, major loss of protest &amp; voting rights, just for a start.
The DP has no intention of moving the country forward.   They intend to maintain the status quo exactly as it is. That's why they shut out Sanders again to  name Biden--in mental decline-- as the primary winner. Will the American ppl allow a bribed DP to get away with this again?
Imagine what they would say if Trump went to a presser with a list of reporters names, the questions each was going to ask, and the answers all written in little index cards.  Even with all that prep, Biden still can't get through it without babbling about nonsense.
Biden is incapable of being an FDR or  a progressive. Bernie Sanders policies picks up where FDR left things. Sanders should be running for President.  I've left the DP for removing him.
Not this time. Biden is well known and people like him. #Vote
Biden to Announce His Pick for Vice-President Next Week

I would absolutely *love it* if Biden picked Harris because there is a non-zero chance the VP will be president in this situation
This is quick calculation so could be missing something but if Trump wins Wisconsin and below in this list, wouldn't the Electoral college be tied, and wouldn't the Current House break the tie, thus picking Biden?
Centrists really just see Joe Biden being a racist right in front of their eyes and straight-up choose not to see it

I don’t think we’ll see marijuana legalized in this administration, his. That’s why I would have voted for Bernie in 2016 and voted Gary Johnson back then, and would have voted Bernie again this time or Yang even. Neither Biden nor 45 are going to legalize it.
Not saying Biden is evil.  He is unfit to serve as president.
What's ironic to me is that Biden is probably the lowest functioning candidate of them all in the 2020 primaries. 🤣

Yeah there hasn’t because joe Biden isn’t a narcissistic attention seeker with psychofantic followers. Joe is a real leader who doesn’t need his ego stroked like you.
5. I am what my aunt calls a “bleeding heart liberal.” I will be voting for Joe Biden in November.
My only counterpoint would be that the networks may pressure him to do it because the ratings would be through the roof.  At this point it has to be a toss up for the Biden campaign. It's bad it they do, bad if they don't. They are just trying to find a credible excuse.
And it starts. Biden wins, and it will be all about cutting spending to take care of the deficit THE REPUBLICANS CREATED.

these are the exit polls from Sanders Biden primaries. It's clear Sanders won.  So, again, let's demand the DP reinstate the real winner and move on to a much better future.
exit polls showed Sanders won over Biden in numerous states.

You just want to use trump out if office as an excuse to be complacent and shove racism under the rug.  Go back to the way things were.  Cause news flash.  Obama didn't give two shits about Eric gardner.  Gave two shits about the crime bill biden helped make. You won't respond
I would crawl from my deathbed to vote for Joe Biden and save the country I love from your horrible father. Donald Trump is the incompetent. He is corrupt and stupid. I am not  "radical" or "left".  I always voted Republican, as did my entire family. Not this time.
Tell me Who in their right mind will vote for Biden besides PinkHats and Girly Men? No One!
I hate Joe Biden with all my heart
I think that's true. Biden supporters have an emotional drive to do this as well as a rational one if it ends up tamping down criticism. You know Republicans will be complaining about bad coverage so Democrats need to as well. It's working the refs.
If I am an editor do I encourage my reporters to research? Politically cynical things Biden has done? Or crimes against humanity from 45?  How much time should be devoted to each of these things? For every bad thing Biden has done, Trump's done 100. Coverage should match that.
This badly misrepresents the problem. It's not an issue of not reporting facts, it's an editorial question. Which facts? And how much page space or air time to devote to them. Biden had eggs for breakfast. Do we need to know that? Is not reporting on his breakfast self censoring?
He's just going to correct the "Biden has been in government" part and not the rest of that grammatical abomination?
Again. Does Biden not have his own merits? Separate from Trump?

Want to know what Obama said and did to manipulate Sanders into stepping down while backing an unfit, mentally declining Biden.
Not aware of the Lincoln Project. But why is there a problem with legitimate criticism, even censure, of both DP &amp; Biden?  DP rigged another election &amp; installed an unfit Biden, who hasn't been seen in-person or spoken in public for how long?  Unconscionable.
Ok but can we have someone do this with Biden’s voice, saying the same things... and then have Trump see it. Cause he’d call Biden all sorts of mentally off 🤣   #personmanwomancameratv

Remember when we had a progressive  candidate running for president and you trashed him in favor of Joe Biden ahead of major primaries.

I think we’re going to see another era of one term presidents over the next decade. Trump will likely lose, Biden will decline a 2nd term and his VP will likely run and win but party fatigue will lead to a GOP win in 2028. By the end of the decade we’ll see the 48th President.
This is the new Hate Party doing Putin's bidding. Romney and Baker might vote for Biden. Obama's eulogy at Lewis funeral today was inspirational.
Yes, because “no more tweeting” is the most concerning thing about a potential Biden presidency. 🙄 You’re going to need a better tactic than, “I won’t tweet like Trump does.” We all know that technological advances of the last 10 years befuddle you, and that’s no malarkey!
Good for Rep Jones!! Notice Melvin wouldn’t answer the question related to Biden at the end of video?!
Next month be 69 years for me and I sadly, totally agree. Vote for Biden.

Watching the Democrats in action I cant help but notice how all they know is how to criticise the President.   I have noticed they never have any idea of what they would have done differently than the President.   Biden uses what the Pres has already done as his strategy! 😂
The article itself agrees with you.  It's supporting Biden.  Not sure why you'd want to attack other Biden supporters.

I am predicting October surprise gifts from Putin, Xi, and Un.  False trade and/or arms treaties for which Trump can declare victories.  Also, a late Biden scandal or smear that after Nov. turns up false.
At the barest minimum Biden needs to be able to hear feedback that his words, politics, and votes caused harm to black people. Get thee behind, Chris Dodd.

That is a travesty. I hope Biden has it removed immediately after inauguration!

Come on, you can’t be seriously comparing Joe Biden to malicious dictator-in-training
Imagine that.  Who would have thought that Joe Biden had these thoughts...
No. 94 crime bill. Written by Biden. Patriot Act. Yeah that was Biden. The democrats have given Trump just about everything he wants. Caging children happened when Biden was VP. The neoliberal capitalists gave us Trump. Biden gave us Trump. Biden is far right.
Biden's not a pedophile.   Just another projection from Trump the sexual predator/rapist/sex trafficker.  #TrumpThreatensAmerica
Biden isn't going to make those changes. He has always been a republic dressed with a D, and for some reason, you believe the democrats are the good guys even though they keep moving further and further right. Biden is a known pathological liar.
The treatment of Bernie and other outsider candidates by the party and their cohorts will drive  many embittered voters to not pull the lever for Biden IMO
It has nothing to do with the "lesser of two evils." Hillary is a democrat. Biden is a democrat. That's reason enough to never vote for either one of them. Democrats are cancer.

Magical thinking. Dangerously negligent. BIDEN 2020
By your "logic" Joe Biden should disqualify himself. He's associated with the Catholic Church for years despite it's "clear history of abuse." But hey, have fun tearing down an accomplished black women with a hit piece sourced to a right wing rag founded by Tucker Carlson.
I could continue but I think that's enough.  Really, as a white dude, I remember how much Biden's "restore the soul," his vigorous defense of the Obama legacy, and his "good guy" tonic image to Trump grew on me in the primaries.  It's what got Biden to where he is today.
I live in Mass. I’ve seen project Lincoln commercials and Biden commercials but zero Trump commercials.
Jon, your side was cheated when Bernie didn’t get it. I dislike Bernie’s policies but not him. Seems very affable. Wild as a young Rep, but honest. Very honest. Biden is a freak mannequin bullshit artist. Can’t do it ever.

"Evanina (Dir. NCSC) ultimately acknowledged that Russia is again trying to boost President Donald Trump’s reelection and denigrate his opponent, the presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, sources who attended the briefing said."
1. This conversation is about the First Lady. 2. Biden has been concerned about the people of the United States for a lot longer than Twitter has even existed.
The fact of the matter is that this is NOT the time for liberals to be criticizing the Dem candidate. By all means, do so as soon as soon as we take back the white house. But doing anything other than offering full throated support for Biden only serves to help Trump
I think it is important to keeping a Democrat in the WH that Biden tee up his VP to run in 2024. And for that reason he should pick Kamala Harris
once should keep an eye on senate seats in swing states - MT, NC, GA, IA. If GOP thinks it cannot salvage presidency,  may tinker with senate elections (various ways to cheat and other countries can oblige) to keep senate in their control and obstruct any Biden agenda.

If Biden's VP pick is suppose to succeed him as the next President, it should probably be someone Democrats already want to be President like Warren or Harris. If most voters will need to be introduced to the VP like Tim Kaine was, it's a missed opportunity for Biden.

Polling among all age groups also finds strong opposition to abortion without restriction up to birth and taxpayer-funded abortions — the position that Biden now holds.
Joe Biden is struggling to reach religious voters. It’s hardly a surprise. Biden is a pro-abortion Democrat who opposes religious freedom – even for nuns — and wants to force taxpayers to pay for abortions.

That awkward moment when you’re in such pure shock from reading the words “Joe Biden” and “further left” in the same sentence that you don’t even finish reading the sentence correctly
“Joe Biden is further left than Bernie Sanders” is certainly a take
He said  “she’s 12 I’ve never been into that”
Kamala Harris has now answered these attacks, but Biden hasn’t.  Not a good look.
There are so many women who are prepared, experienced, highly capable, to lead this country and be potus. I’m not sure why you demand anything like this. I’m sure Biden knows his choice is important if something happens to him. Younger ppl die. JFK, Bobby Kennedy were murdered.
Bernie Sanders and AOC are already on record supporting this maggot's right to vote. Does their marionette, Joe Biden, agree? Better question: Will he ever be asked?
Yup. And ironically their solution is Joe “You know, the thing” Biden.

Brown didnt “severely hamper” anything. He was notable only for having one time been a centerfold. He didnt do anything particularly controvesial and cast no swing votes.  The ACA was “hampered” by scared centrists that Biden as VP was able to push over the line.
Republicans want a stimulus extension of $1T. Democrats want more than $3T. If Biden is elected, and the Dems get control of both the Upper and Lower houses, get ready for extreme fiscal imprudence, and consequently, the implosion of the USD.
Joe Biden is president?
NYT article predicts Representative Karen Bass for VP, and explains why. If Joe thinks so, sounds good to me  😃
Hi, as an actual Mass resident, I can tell you it is 100% safe. The seat can be filled on Nov 3, and Brown was the first R senator in MA since the 1970’s.  I notice you say “almost” quite a lot as while ignoring it DID happen, in part bc VP Biden was whipping votes.
A lot of people don’t know much about Kaine.  He was an Obama guy.  Mayor of Richmond, Governor of Virginia, Senator of Virginia.  Hardly an unambitious loyalist.  But it’s whatever.  Biden is already the Tim Kaine figure.
Things f'ing exploded all right, and we still wanted Biden over Bernie four years later. I'll never forgive you,
Where is it taking place? How many people can social distance in Biden's basement?

So bad....I’ve tried to see things from the other side and I just can’t figure out their thought process. Bottom line is that they will do anything and everything to get him out of office. If he is voted back in, it will be 4 more years of the same. And Biden? God help us.

Disagree.  I think Klobuchar, Bullock, Bennet, etc. would have been fine as far as ideology.  But none have strong connections w/ the African-American community.  And none have the moral authority of the Obama administration nor the biography of Joe Biden.
Biden’s wife should be charged with Elder abuse!!!
They can all go to hell, especially after Clinton having 3 million more votes in 2016. They inflicted this 4-year trauma on all of us, let them stew in their own paranoid delusions for the next 4-years while Biden and Democrats get shit done.
YES!!!!! If this is indeed the case I don’t think we’ll be seeing Donnie hanging around. He hates Joe Biden but he DEESSPIISES Nancy Pelosi.
Suddenly I’m less hopefully about the Veepstakes and feel so deflated.   Kamala has been working her ass off for Biden and to see her potentially derailed by weak white men threatened by her ambition is awful.    and  showed the type of people they are.
Not close to excited. I thought for sure Kamala now I am back to thinking Liz Warren give the very public bashing Kamala got from people close to Biden this week
But I feel like if you have to explain that I knew her at 12 and she was so “beautiful” (not pretty like most 12 yos are described) He was struck by it then say but when she turned 25... wink wink - still pervy
I agree with this. If I’m Biden I’m going with Harris and if not Harris then Duckworth. No reason to overthink it.   I love Warren but with things going the way they are (big lead, national pandemic) there’s no reason to give Trump &amp; his team such an obvious target / distraction

either option is shitty for Biden. Just like how this entire process has unfolded in the last 2-3 weeks. This all could have been much better. If he wanted it to...
are these series of Kamala is the reincarnation of the devil leaks from old white men a result of Biden already having told them she is the pick? And they dont like it?  Or Biden testing the waters to see if any of these slanders stick, thereby not selecting Kamala.

Not to mention, I make comments like this and not a single reply from Biden's social media team. It is as if they are using Twitter to lecture instead of engage with their audience – which is the purpose of the platform.
I do not plan to vote for Trump. As a marketer, Biden's marketing is just so horrible. None of his social appears remotely close to his own voice. And Marketing 101 is not to mention your competition – it just amplifies their voice. Worried about Biden's ability to communicate.
boy you aren't kidding. I have been noticing that they have been actively campaigning harder against Biden than actual Trumpers. Very "progressive" of them.
There’s been like 10 hit pieces.  People are gunning for Harris, and only Biden can put a stop to that.
honestly didn’t give enough credit to people’s ability to see right through JK3 so this is a nice recovery from the nihilism I got from watching puppets dragging Biden across the finish line
Thought we were talking about Biden&amp;Trump here. Calling it for what it is...is not hateful. Keeping quiet on Dems unending relentless pursuit to get rid ofTrump ever since he stepped into office &amp;yet pretending to be the victims when conservatives fight back. Don’t instigate then
I really don’t think most voters will care about that. Plus I don’t think her Castro comments are that bad and even still Biden’s the top of the ticket and is clearly doing well in Florida.   Also Kamala living in Canada for years is a vulnerability that hasn’t been tapped yet.
Biden isn't in the video. You'd think a presidential candidate would share his presidential action plans instead of running on the platform: The current president stinks.
I think the media is the one dragging this out. He already said months ago that he would make his decision in early August. They've been covering potential picks nonstop since Bernie dropped out of the race. I don't think that's Biden's fault. My 2 cents.
They're for anything that is corrupt! You would have to be brain dead to vote DemonRat.  Unless you want all your cities to a lawless jungle. If Demonrat voters could take a glimpse into the future if Biden was elected, they would regret it every day that they lived. 💯%FACT!!

Bernie couldn’t have been more explicit that he would sheepdog for the eventual winner again, and he’s doing it avidly. But if Biden manages to lose, the Dem chorus will be “Bernie did nothing to help Biden and his toxic Bros love Trump,” not that it matters.
The July 15 attack compromised the accounts of some of its most high profile users, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk and former Vice President Joe Biden.
I saw Bernie as a worthwhile compromise with some chance of getting elected. His sheepdogging history preceded him but is now more flagrant than ever. Mostly I’m seeing Berners not following him into active support for Biden.
Listening to covid19 hearings, it seems to me that, 1. Trump denied covid19 when it mattered most 2. Trump failed to listen to experts 3. Trump held unsafe rallies, Hermain Cain died 4. Trump has no plan.  5. Trump has killed 153,000 plus Americans.

Oh they don’t care what Biden does or did lol they just want Trump out lol..it quite sad actually wanting a pedo in there because you hate the President so much
is a blatant admission there’s no positive case for biden, and as i’ve shown, there’s barely a negative one if you compare him to trump honestly  why don’t you fuck off and do something useful
Biden would forgive all undergraduate “tuition-related” student debt for borrowers who earn less than $125,000 a year and attended public community colleges or four-year institutions.
Biden is on a roll. #GhislaineMaxwell #Outnumbered

This article is basically telephone in written form. None of the "sources" are remotely close to Biden or know what he's going to do, but you media folks will continue to push anyone but Warren for VPYes, some of Biden’s VP candidates are cringe-worthy. But he could choose Snooki or Honey Boo Boo at this point and I’d still vote for him over Trump.

What if Biden picks another woman at their recommendation?   Still misogyny?

How Joe Biden got greener - The Washington Post
In his Biden interview, Ady Barkan reflected on the nominee's proposed budget for the NIH stating simply "I don't think that's enough." Watching him always moves me, but Ady having found in  someone whose "optimism and perseverance" ARE enough nearly brought me to tears.
and this is on top of all the voter suppression that Democrats let Republicans get away with uncontested because it helped Biden win the primary
Fuck Biden too tho
Who needs logic, right? If you don’t think Biden’s Administration would work with a variety of departments and organizations (especially regarding science, economics, etc) to improve public health and return Americans to the work place, you must not think before you speak.
oh boy the other corrupt party that uses victims for votes!  all the crime cesspools and police problems are in longtime blue cities.  And Biden has helped no one in 50yrs and touches kids.  but yay for your feelings!
On election night, even if many votes are not yet counted, we'll still know that you lost the election.  Biden will win by a landslide.  Intelligent Americans are fed up with having an incompetent criminal in the White House.
Postponing the election will cause a longer wait.  We will vote on Nov. 3, whether at the polls or by mail, and we will wait patiently to welcome Joe Biden as our president.  Having to wait for the results doesn't change the outcome.  #Biden2020
Many people are looking extra closely at this VP pick due to the fact that Biden will probably not seek a second term if elected. There’s a very good chance that his VP will succeed him as president
It’s plausible Biden will do more for reform &amp; racial tensions than Trump, who has more than sold out to his base who sees not much wrong with enforcement as is. But if he can also listen to experts in many fields on how to get people back to work safely, employment ⬆️ protest ⬇️
One of the main issues now is that federal agents are going after protestors &amp; not just rioters. You could argue it’s just the media perception distributing that, but we’d probably both agree then that the perception would shift when Biden was elected. Biden’s a good corporatist.
I don’t know if your opinion is rooted in fact.  One stance I could take is how Biden vs. Trump would handle the pandemic. If Biden’s admin can quell the virus better than Trump &amp; get people back to work life safely faster than Trump can, unemployment resolved faster &gt; less riots
Sanders won in numerous states (mine included) where exit polls showed he won by a significant margin, while the DP vote count declared Biden the winner. We cannot support a corrupt party that steals elections for 1% psychopaths who would destroy the majority to continue to rule.
The important thing right now is to get Trump out of office and the only way to do that is to vote for Biden. Voting anyone else would be foolish as it would guarantee Trump’s re-election. Political issues are secondary and they can be debated and negotiated once Trump is gone.
not that I thought it was likely that biden would get anarchist votes, he certainly isn't going to now. People tend not to like being told in advance they would be arrested for having opinions.
#WeWillVote for Vice President Biden!
TFW the edibles Joe Biden still hasn't legalized yet hit.
if he resigns before the election, he can forever say he did not lose to Biden
if he resigns in the next month or so, he can go to his grave telling everyone Biden did not beat him
There will be less rioting  Most of the rioting is happenin from the police anyway. I’m half kiddin, but let’s call tear gassing protestors the fed’s version of “rioting.”  All Biden needs is to people back to working again, &amp; to do even moderate police reform. Workers don’t riot
Not sure where you are getting that 56% number. Mom of 3, voting for Biden and NOT sending my kids to school during this pandemic with Trump as president.  My kids will not be sacrificed.

biden bros are at it again!
Continue....so "When the river sounds something brings!" Trump is already contesting an election that hasn't taken place so expect the worst. In his mind, he isn't going anywhere. Trump declared Biden/Trump election results may take years so be aware a dictatorship ahead.....
Guaranteed he will try and litigate it if Biden wins.
Ha ha ha!!!  Ha ha!!! I love watching Trump squirm while he looks for ways to cheat so he can win. He made his own noose.  First term FAIL! BIDEN 2020!

Trump Can’t Stop the Election, But He Can Threaten Democracy
All Trump needs is a handful of sycophant Govs to delay their elections to sow chaos, and manufacture a crisis.  Imagine GA, FL, NC, AZ  all postpone, and Biden gets to 267 electoral votes on Nov 3.
They all like Biden.
Trump/gop policies continue to increase deaths.They WANT people to die off to keep control over all.  We can't sit back and watch like a DP that sabotaged the one politician capable of pulling us out of this terrifying mess.  They rig &amp; offer weak unfit Biden. We can't cave. Act.
Sadly troops died under Bush’s misguided wars, &amp; thereafter under the feckless policies of the Obama-Biden Administration.  Several in my family are &amp; were highly decorated military.  Thankfully, none were killed in combat.   In case you didn’t know? It doesn’t snow in Sicily.
Just about everyone pissed off that Kamala the cop is the vp pick is also against Biden as the nominee. Don’t see your point
Biden's running during an escalation of deaths due to intentionally mismanaged COVID policy. Heard nothing fr Biden to address it, except an adamant refusal to implement &amp; support M4A. This man is unfit on every level, choosing health  industry profit over protecting human lives.

Stand up to joe biden. Openly admits to black mailing Ukraine yet you still think Trump who never blackmailed them is bad. “Orange man” bad when a political hack like Mitt Romney who’s bitter about losing is leading your charge. Now that’s pathetic
A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn’t pretty
and Biden's policies to continue depriving the majority of genuine health care &amp; other rights?  DISRESPECTFUL, UNCARING, TOTALLY LACKING COMPASSION.
sorry to be cruel, but Biden has no problem supporting policies that damage the majority to protect corporate greed.
more of Biden's lies and omissions.
what WE can do in response is not vote for Biden.  Write in Sanders.
The vote can't be delayed, so get that out of your desperate little mind.  If you refuse to leave the WH after Biden is sworn in, you'd be trespassing and could be forcibly removed.  I like that.
following back.  but syk I'm not, nor will ever be a Biden supporter.
Why not just resign now?  By doing this Biden will not have beaten him
If you support Biden, you support LAWLESSNESS, the COLLAPSE OF CAPITALISM, &amp; “CHINA’S WORLD DOMINANCE.
I see....so...you're setting the scene for why when you lose by a landslide "it's fake and so you don't  accept!" I see....well...US Marines dragging your fat ass out of President Biden's House might disagree.
Keeping busy is a must.  Walking/exercise is a mood elevator...those endorphins!  Staying in touch with friends and having pleasant conversation.  Comedy movies/TV are a good distraction.  Voting for Biden in Nov. will be the best thing to do for myself.
We hv a moral, ethical responsibility to vote our conscience &amp; for the absolute best person for President. Will never be Biden. Why are these people who normally provide leadership and astute guidance, selling out to an outrageously corrupt bribe-taking DP to sell Biden for 1%?

NOT VOTING FOR BIDEN.
Well, I hope I gave you some motivation. Fact is, Biden isn't "progressive," but his ideology is more in line with the left than a lot of people realize. And this pandemic seems to have pushed him even farther left. He's been sounding like a Big Time Lib since March.
I mean, is it true that Trump is a fucking Lizard monster in an orange human skin-suit who's broken so many laws (with impunity!) that he should be in jail rather than the oval office? Yes. Sorry. I couldn't hold that in anymore. But, I did give you facts on Biden first. Lol
I get paid to do political research &amp; writing, so I'm fairly well-versed on the subject. Yelling never changes minds; facts might. I'm not stoked on Biden--I'm very much registered Dem to vote for progressives, too, but party infighting is what got us into this clusterfuck.
The Senate is gone.  Trump can still pull it out if Biden goes all Biden in the debates
your man who swore to cut SS and Medicare.  Sure Biden isn't a closet far right Republican?  I'm voting Bernie Sanders.
I see you get that Biden will establish some of the same policies/behavior as trump.  Like pretending peaceful protesters are anarchists. And that the Fed troops illegally sent in to Portland are peaceful police.
If Biden is truly ahead in all the polls then ask yourselves why are they pulling their hair out and freaking out so much?
Forget it. I think it will be her regardless. Biden knows he is a one term President
Electing Biden is acceptg fascism. He will change zero. In many states, exit polls showd large discrepancy bet votes for Sanders &amp; Biden. Sanders clearly won in those states yet Biden was declared winner. THAT is Fascism, so is raiding treasury for rich while forcing poor 2 repay
Biden with anyone is just NO GOOD
Joe Biden is killing you in the polls.  All your childish insults won't prevent him from winning.  We need an adult in the White House.  Tick tock....
for a few seconds this made me seriously consider voting for Trump. seriously, what is wrong with these people? there are arguments for voting for Biden and this sure as fuck isn't it.
Have you heard ‘Rich Rubino: Biden Veepstakes - Crunch Time’ by Talk of the Commonwealth on #SoundCloud? #np
Yeah I think that our generation is definitely cynical. But if people had to put money down on trump or Biden as much as they’d like to make a hot take about society they’d put it on Biden. You can’t look at evidence and say w a straight face that Trump has better than 50% odds.
That was kind of the point. Biden is trying to make it mandatory that low income housing complexes get built into the more affluent suburbs. I spent my whole life in crappy triple deckers in a crap inner city. I don’t think I deserve nice suburbia unless I work my way to it.
Yeah I’m new to the game but the first time I heard Corporatist was when I read an intercept article on him. Honestly if the one good thing Biden does in his administration is legalize pot id consider it one of the best presidencies since eisenhower
it isn't even August and the Biden coalition is already showing signs of eating itself though  like there were always a whole host of reasons why it was obviously a bad idea to vote for Trump  but Clinton ran a historically bad campaign  Biden could easily run a worse one
Damn if Biden becomes a bad ass president does he become the next Chuck Norris joke?
Of course. Then stick a Biden for President bumper sticker on their car
following you but I'm no Biden voter supporter.
Just like rescinding the AFFH rule, which will adversely affect many of his supporters, and repealing the ACA will eliminate medical coverage for thousands of his supporters.  Such a winning strategy....for Biden.

So vote for Biden is what you’re saying? Resign
Ah yes Biden the man who totally supports a healthcare plan that will be helpful for all Americans and totally wouldn't doom the most vulnerable demographic of COVID-19 victims
The democrats are going to get in with a False Mandate. They’re going to act like because they won, possibly quite big, that America is behind their brand of politics. The underlying indicators though are that this is not the case. Biden generates almost no enthusiasm, and he won
Without covid, Biden would’ve had his ass kicked by Trump. They learned nothing from 2016 and ran an even more incompetent campaign. But it’s nearly impossible to win an election when you fuck something up this bad. Get this many people killed/economically displaced.
Swap out “Sleepy Joe Biden” with “”Corrupt Donald Trump” and “Radical Left” with “Russia” and it will be your first honest statement since taking office.
then why hasn't the DP &amp; Biden identified critical issues as part of their DP platform to help people recover from decades long stagnant wages, high cost of essential products, health care bankruptcies, major loss of protest &amp; voting rights, just for a start.
I don't dislike Biden at all. This is sad. Someone needs to step in and say enough.
The DP has no intention of moving the country forward.   They intend to maintain the status quo exactly as it is. That's why they shut out Sanders again to  name Biden--in mental decline-- as the primary winner. Will the American ppl allow a bribed DP to get away with this again?
. "They’re desperate to keep Biden hidden until as many early &amp; mail-in votes as possible are cast because they know the 1st time he’s on his own in public he’s going to pull down his mask &amp; start sniffing strangers/"
I don't *want* Trump to win, but I can't say I would prefer that Biden wins at this point  4 years versus 8 of a President who wants to lock me up
Biden is incapable of being an FDR or  a progressive. Bernie Sanders policies picks up where FDR left things. Sanders should be running for President.  I've left the DP for removing him.

All Biden needs are a few more Trump interviews like the one with Chris Wallace.  He doesn’t need to do a thing, except stay out of trouble.
Then how do you explain Trumps delusions? Biden is at least a decent person. Trump is not. He has untrained enforcement attacking moms and vets. #TrumpGestapo
His acceptance is irrelevant. If he loses, power transfers to Biden automatically 1/20/21. Biden can be President from anyplace and can order Secret Service to remove Trump.   Why is this a question? Has it been a question for any other POTUS?  No, it hasn’t.

There is no way Joe Biden is actually tweeting. This is a staff member or his wife. She seems to be his handler and the competent brain  of this couple. It is sad to watch his confusion play out so publicly.
she has been in her current relationship for over 3 years and i’d rather her endorse biden than trump 🤷‍♀️
I just got an email from the campaign pitching a video chat with Biden and Warren if I donated, so...I have no idea.
Trump sucks in general and is racist in particular. That is all.

Who Is actually gonna say this?  Socialists hate his policies and liberals literally just want Trump out. Are there unironically Joe Biden stans in existence or is this hyperbole?

Not saying Biden is evil.  He is unfit to serve as president.
. knows that we can put long-overdue protections and accountability into law and remove barriers to justice. He knows that women will not stand for silence or complacency anymore. Together, we can ensure every voice will be heard.

Dear God, if u have ever listened to me..please do not make this guy our next president. I would rather have Mickey mouse than Biden...thank u.
I think even if Biden gets in, steadies the ship, enacts more progressive policies and the GOP doesnt go full fash, which is the BEST CASE SCENARIO in our current political system, this sort of thing is going to continue to happen
I'm very excited for Biden to pick his VP so we get the many many  many  many  many  many reasons why she isn't the perfect choice.
We need to stop Joe Biden effective immediately defend the police we have to get more Policeman on fourth if not we are at risk high risk I don’t wanna defend the police it’s up to you to get Joe Biden stop his campaign and shut him down forever it’s your callTo destroy Joe Biden

The president should not have had to ask about Biden. It should have been a given.
Most Americans, many in red states, no longer want a so-called president who represents only white, rich republicans.  We're ready to return to decency, integrity, honesty and diversity.  And that's why Joe Biden will win.  You are an insult to the intelligence of Americans!
Yeah there hasn’t because joe Biden isn’t a narcissistic attention seeker with psychofantic followers. Joe is a real leader who doesn’t need his ego stroked like you.
5. I am what my aunt calls a “bleeding heart liberal.” I will be voting for Joe Biden in November.
100 days until I get to vote for the Biden/Rice ticket.
And it starts. Biden wins, and it will be all about cutting spending to take care of the deficit THE REPUBLICANS CREATED.
In analogy of the old slogan of Genesis does what Nintendon't, Biden does what Presidon't.
I'm NOT in Scott, not promoting a 1% backing/backed man in serious mental decline.  Biden is being hidden by DP. No public appearances, no spontaneous speeches. Yet another scam perpetrated on the country &amp; Americans by a corrupt bought DP.
This is what #MAGA do to Joe Biden ever time he tweets...😂
The people who are now saying that we need to embrace the political consequences of total opposition to Joe Biden are the same people who warned about the rise of fascism when it was judges proclaiming that the violent suppression of Occupy was legal because it was predictable
Biden would not be the Democratic nominee if not for the 3 million vote margins in the national popular vote  Blue state Sanders supporters who let themselves get bullied into voting for her screwed us and it seems like most haven't learned anything from 2016 except vote harder

Are you really challenging Biden’s intelligence when you make mistakes everyday? #IdiotInChief
Biden could run with my dog Lucy and still beat you by +15.  Fuck all the way off.
I love my daughters. One’s voting against Trump. One’s voting for Trump.  Neither is voting for Biden.
Joe Biden's caring???  Despicable.  Name 10 things he did for Americans for the past 5 decades.
these are the exit polls from Sanders Biden primaries. It's clear Sanders won.  So, again, let's demand the DP reinstate the real winner and move on to a much better future.
exit polls showed Sanders won over Biden in numerous states.
yes, hellish even with the usual DP lesser of two evils, this time with biden
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
You just want to use trump out if office as an excuse to be complacent and shove racism under the rug.  Go back to the way things were.  Cause news flash.  Obama didn't give two shits about Eric gardner.  Gave two shits about the crime bill biden helped make. You won't respond

I voted for Warren in the primaries. I have no interest in a Biden candidacy or presidency.  But here we are. Our candidates lost. I’m not going to split the vote because I’m mad about it.
Biden, walsh and baker lie and they think that we all morons.
Same deal with Biden and his authorship of the Crime Bill and the Patriot Act as well as his support for imperialism  There's no response offered because folks have simply not integrated it into their understanding
He only regrets the ones that cause him trouble or don’t garner a reaction. He fires out tweets looking to find a new word, nickname, or catch phrase that he can hang his hat on.  He’s mad cause he can’t find one for Biden.
jeeze, still mad? you guys won the primary, bernie is campaigning for biden and most of us have gone back to doing activism.
I hate Joe Biden with all my heart
I think that's true. Biden supporters have an emotional drive to do this as well as a rational one if it ends up tamping down criticism. You know Republicans will be complaining about bad coverage so Democrats need to as well. It's working the refs.
If I am an editor do I encourage my reporters to research? Politically cynical things Biden has done? Or crimes against humanity from 45?  How much time should be devoted to each of these things? For every bad thing Biden has done, Trump's done 100. Coverage should match that.
This badly misrepresents the problem. It's not an issue of not reporting facts, it's an editorial question. Which facts? And how much page space or air time to devote to them. Biden had eggs for breakfast. Do we need to know that? Is not reporting on his breakfast self censoring?
He's just going to correct the "Biden has been in government" part and not the rest of that grammatical abomination?
Like time spent making phone calls for Biden is time you didn't spend familiarizing yourself with firearms or organizing to create an autonomous zone
when I say that voting for Biden isn't going to do anything I am not advocating another Trump term jesus fuck  I'm saying that acting like voting him in has anything to do with de-Trumpification is harmful to the body politic
We know what we know. #Biden signaled anti-LEO agenda.
That is what's actually believed though  No matter what you tell them about Biden they plug in infinity on the other side of the equation so by default Trump is infinitely worse  It's asinine  It prevents any honest discourse
finitely  finitely worse  or did you forget that Biden is a rapist and a warmonger, that he lied to promote the Iraq War, and that he's responsible for the creation of the modern slave state and much of the panopticon
It was to get progressive leaders to sign on to the Biden campaign
No she’s some hybrid wackadoodle deficit hawk nihilist. A different strain.   Worrying about Biden, a moderate and lifelong friend of the banking industry blowing a deficit with social spending is a new flavor of dumb, esp given Trump’s record or spending and actual theft.
does anyone really think that Biden is going to rescind the finding that antifa is a terror org?  "Look I know what my predecessor did but these aren't the same guys! These people are unhinged, they think *I'm a fascist"  Vox dot com does a bad faith explainer as to why that is
Because Biden is a menace who must be opposed
Lol Biden is a right winger that's what he was going to do anyway  You're engaging in full on magical thinking and shaming me for not taking part
The people who have influence over Biden are the people who might not vote for him  The consequence of AOC shoring up the left vote for Biden is that now he's courting ex Trumpers
The Biden campaign had just murdered people to see up the nomination  The idea that they were going to offer the left *anything* was fucking ludicrous  And negotiating with them means not holding them accountable for murder
Top three folks not out and about with public speculation on Biden VP lists that I wish were?
Actually we should just vote for Biden because Trump is fucking killing people, and four more years of right wing judges will fuck us all.  The time for other options was the primaries. I tried. I worked my heart out to avoid Biden. But here we are.
Someone just said Trump thinks he'll catch up during the debates. Really? WHY would Biden even bother to debate, he's already winning? Let Trump continue to sink himself. Every time he opens his stupid mouth he shows who he is and what he knows. Actions speak louder than words.
Trump 2020 fuck Biden

Want to know what Obama said and did to manipulate Sanders into stepping down while backing an unfit, mentally declining Biden.
Not aware of the Lincoln Project. But why is there a problem with legitimate criticism, even censure, of both DP &amp; Biden?  DP rigged another election &amp; installed an unfit Biden, who hasn't been seen in-person or spoken in public for how long?  Unconscionable.

The point of the task forces was to sheepdog the left  Policy wise they were a farce-- even the thoroughly mediocre work they turned in is completely non binding and Biden has pretty much signalled that he'd ignore them

Joe Biden is a puppet of the Mobsquad👎💩
Biden, Obama defend their handling of police issues and criticize Trump administration
"Biden will eat every child under four in the entire country," Trump continued. "I will not eat any children. Biden will personally set fire to your house and salt the earth beneath the ashes. I will give you brand new siding and free cable for life!"
The fact that Obama is backing Biden in his current state is disappointing.
I don't speak in rhetoric. I talk facts &amp; will speak when &amp; as I choose.  If you checked my bio, you'd know I detest Trump. Biden is a 50 year centrist.  FGS, propagandist,  check his record before YOU speak.
Remember when we had a progressive  candidate running for president and you trashed him in favor of Joe Biden ahead of major primaries.
I know.  Biden NEEDS. To take it,   Just the fact that trump is going on tv, still talking about it and no one told him the truth yet, what the test means 🤣😂.  My puppy needs me to play,   She barks at me when I pick up my phone. 🤪.   I’ll tweet  later.😍

Um isn’t Biden being tested? He must have secret service protection by now. He and his staff should be tested like the White House, daily or whatever. Certainly before and after travel.
I mean the whole episode made her look phony because her actual stance on busing isn’t all that different from Biden’s and she still doesn’t have a great response over even simple questions about a debate, let alone her record as prosecutor.

Watch any video, within the last several years of Joe Biden. Listen to every word that man says. And tell me with a straight face and honest heart that you believe with all sincerity that he’s fit to run this country.
At least we know that Biden understands what it means to govern. Or understood, if his cognitive ability has indeed plummeted in the last four years. I hope you’re wrong that he will be to the Democrats what GWB was to the Republicans.

The summary description of Jill Biden’s book still kills me— this is the most Joe Biden thing I’ve ever seen—  “how did you get this number” just gold.
You’ve got to maneuver on the team/ staff job angle as well as the qualifications of the nominees. What VP team does Biden’s team want or need to work with.   It’s a lot trickier than the nominees themselves.
If someone asked Biden if he’d pick a wombat for a running mate, beating out the person who asked him if he’d pick a woman, he’d have also said “yes”. Whatever they place in front of him, he always says “yes”.
I’ve got my thoughts on who the VP should be but let’s be honest, Biden could nominate Kasich and I’d still show up in November and begrudgingly cast my vote against this seditious failure.

just saw a trump commercial in which an old woman is watching the news about lawlessness in Trump's America and a man breaks in and murders her??? and at the end it says "you won't be safe in Joe Biden's America" and I guess I'm just wondering what's happening????
No one in their RIGHT MIND SHOULD BACK "SENILE BIDEN"........AND IF YOU HAVE A HALF A BRAIN ....YOU WONT BELIEVE THE FAKE NEWS "POLLS" EITHER............HILLARY WAS SURE TO WIN TO!!#####   YA....RIGHT
Biden needs to pick a VP already. Covid has killed my anticipation and this is usually my favorite part of the election
“Beat Biden off” - be my guest JT
He’s not wrong, he will have more write in ballots than Biden.
Harry you said at the end there that there’s still a large amount of undecideds which could swing the race either way. In many polls Biden is over 50 percent, so in that scenario wouldn’t Biden still win if Trump won 100 percent of the undecideds? Just curious.
No 👏 Sleep 👏 Till 👏 Biden 👏 (chanted to the tune of The Beastie Boys' "No Sleep Till Brooklyn")
We will cancel you and your cult members in November. When Biden is President, we will once again have culture, class, intelligence and experience in the White House.
As the face of the company he’s largely choosing the direction it goes. Big Cat mentioned that they turned down a biden interview but took this one. While Portnoy doesn’t shut down his employees opinions it’s not hard to see why makes these decisions and who he caters to
just decided that when I cast my vote for Joe Biden this November it will NOT be for Biden but for RBG because if she goes there’s no way I’m letting a Brett Kavanaugh 2.0 take her spot
She is at top cause she is the most compatible with Biden....she is looking at the future.... imagine if biden picks someone who wants to cut military budget... he could be painted with not caring about the military.  .... and plus they work fir the people not just the left
Joe biden would have voted No as well...
Thank you for planning to vote for Joe Biden.We need our country back.
How about the Dems let Biden talk without a teleprompter.  That’s their biggest fear
Why would Bernie get to choose a progressive like himself rather than a ‘moderate’ to help unify the party? 🌹 on the left now say Biden MUST select a progressive in order to appease them, but that doesn’t seem to have been the standard if Bernie would have won. Interesting, no?

I didn’t support Biden in the primary, but AA voters saw something in him, that he was the most electable. Bernie would not be ahead in GA, TX, OH, IA, Trump would have reframed the debate from Covid to ‘scary socialism’ and it would have been harder to win. They were right!
wait until you see tonight's Biden/Obama ratings! Tremendous ratings, like nothing you've ever seen before.
Make something happen your the boss light the torch of liberty and justice under somebodies  ass and nail the dirty scoundrels the wall, Hillary is a devil, Obama is a disgrace, and Biden is a sick joke,Please Biden select your VP so I stop getting "WHO'S YOUR PICK FOR VP????" fundraiser emails.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Come on, you can’t be seriously comparing Joe Biden to malicious dictator-in-training
Imagine that.  Who would have thought that Joe Biden had these thoughts...
No. 94 crime bill. Written by Biden. Patriot Act. Yeah that was Biden. The democrats have given Trump just about everything he wants. Caging children happened when Biden was VP. The neoliberal capitalists gave us Trump. Biden gave us Trump. Biden is far right.
Biden's not a pedophile.   Just another projection from Trump the sexual predator/rapist/sex trafficker.  #TrumpThreatensAmerica
Biden isn't going to make those changes. He has always been a republic dressed with a D, and for some reason, you believe the democrats are the good guys even though they keep moving further and further right. Biden is a known pathological liar.
The treatment of Bernie and other outsider candidates by the party and their cohorts will drive  many embittered voters to not pull the lever for Biden IMO
It has nothing to do with the "lesser of two evils." Hillary is a democrat. Biden is a democrat. That's reason enough to never vote for either one of them. Democrats are cancer.

Joe Biden essentially announcing that he’s going to implement  excellent Small Business Plan for Black Americans. #WarrenForVP
Biden's short list just got shorter!
I think a lot of the people that have been mentioned as candidates will get a role into the Biden administration
And there's a certain moral authority added to Joe Biden -- who as VP vigorously defended our nation's first black President and ran on restoring the moral authority in the office of the Presidency -- in picking an African-American woman. (2/2)
First thing I can agree with you on. Biden will win
*Opens twitter, sees Joe Biden, happily opens wallet.*

Magical thinking. Dangerously negligent. BIDEN 2020
By your "logic" Joe Biden should disqualify himself. He's associated with the Catholic Church for years despite it's "clear history of abuse." But hey, have fun tearing down an accomplished black women with a hit piece sourced to a right wing rag founded by Tucker Carlson.
I could continue but I think that's enough.  Really, as a white dude, I remember how much Biden's "restore the soul," his vigorous defense of the Obama legacy, and his "good guy" tonic image to Trump grew on me in the primaries.  It's what got Biden to where he is today.
I live in Mass. I’ve seen project Lincoln commercials and Biden commercials but zero Trump commercials.
Jon, your side was cheated when Bernie didn’t get it. I dislike Bernie’s policies but not him. Seems very affable. Wild as a young Rep, but honest. Very honest. Biden is a freak mannequin bullshit artist. Can’t do it ever.
Did Biden’s team do their due doodoo?  Their ship has been killed tight as shit so far...I have a hard time believing they missed this shit
Heard "9 to 5" on the Biden-Warren call and sighed so heavily that my wife tapped my knee. #WarrenForVP
Biden is sad old dog that wants to sleep all day and pees around the house by accident.
Lololololol.  Biden would have to be left for him to do that. He's far-right.
This dude disgusts me. The fact that settle for Biden is a slogan is so fvcking gross. People like  clearly do not understand why it is we have Trump. Let me tell you. It's Biden.
I think she blew her chances when she attacked Biden during one of the debates. I too believe she wud be great on the ticket but look for Stacey Abrams
Biden's VP will be the female that smells the best. #sniffsniff #biden #sniffer #creep #pedojoe #sniff
Putting the Leftist group she was involved in that went to Cuba in the 70’s aside her endorsement of Scientology is horrifying! Biden can not afford to phuck this up!

idk, convince me i have to vote for Biden, or convince me Hawkins is worthwhile.  right now, neither of those are appealing to me.  i'm not trying to be a dick, but i am opening the floor here.  thanks!
absolutely are the parallels between now and late 1920s/early 1930s Germany too on the nose.  Biden is still auth-right.  everyone in this election, and every US election for a century, has been auth-right, except Sanders, maybe Nader, do we get to Teddy for lib-right?
Biden sees Trump's Demon Sperm Doctor, raises him Anti-Xenu VP.
Biden requested early access to briefings, when it was clear trump was doing nothing about the bounties on our soldiers. The national security team has zero reason to withhold anything from the former VP/senator.

"Evanina (Dir. NCSC) ultimately acknowledged that Russia is again trying to boost President Donald Trump’s reelection and denigrate his opponent, the presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, sources who attended the briefing said."
1. This conversation is about the First Lady. 2. Biden has been concerned about the people of the United States for a lot longer than Twitter has even existed.
The fact of the matter is that this is NOT the time for liberals to be criticizing the Dem candidate. By all means, do so as soon as soon as we take back the white house. But doing anything other than offering full throated support for Biden only serves to help Trump
I think it is important to keeping a Democrat in the WH that Biden tee up his VP to run in 2024. And for that reason he should pick Kamala Harris
once should keep an eye on senate seats in swing states - MT, NC, GA, IA. If GOP thinks it cannot salvage presidency,  may tinker with senate elections (various ways to cheat and other countries can oblige) to keep senate in their control and obstruct any Biden agenda.
Joe Biden is up by 10 in every poll, though. Why would any of his stans ever care about VP, he's a shoo-in!
Rich white &amp; entitled moms like you don’t like the idea of ‘Moms For Biden’ because you are out of touch with middle America &amp; the working class families &amp; their struggles.

Look, I’m a crazy RWNJ, but  is a good person who served the city the best she could. Her choice to ride with Biden, but this slug is a clown host. #MSNBC #TheBeat
Not to mention “Latinos merecen alguien mejor que Biden” both treats Latinos as a monolithic bloc - sounds kinda like the “identity politics” they’re always railing against, no? - and also implies the race-baiting, xenophobic President is a better option... huh??
Biden has backed Senator Elizabeth Warren’s call to immediately cancel at least $10,000 of student debt per person. Learn more:  #HigherEd #EdChat
As I’ve said before, the debate kerfuffle was always going to be the toughest issue to get over, but she is still going to be the VP candidate.  No one else seems plausible, IMHO.
She is a republican. Don’t spread her trash and let Biden  make his choice..all the women are top notch.
If Biden does this, Trump would laugh. The race would be over.

If Biden's VP pick is suppose to succeed him as the next President, it should probably be someone Democrats already want to be President like Warren or Harris. If most voters will need to be introduced to the VP like Tim Kaine was, it's a missed opportunity for Biden.
With energy like this, Biden is going to lose in November.

In terms of the voting blocs in the recent primary, I think Markey will get all of Sanders, much of Warren, and some of Biden. Kennedy will get much of Biden, some of Warren, and none of Sanders. I like Ed’s chances.
I will be draining the swamp by voting for Biden. You are one of the worst U.S. presidents to sit in the oval office. The only Americans you have helped are your rich friends. We are voting you out in November!
I've decided that Harris would be the dumbest possible VP pick, because the only ones it would please are people like this guy, who can't even JOKE about making demands of Biden without adding a disclaimer assuring the reader that he didn't really mean it and will do as told
I'm black so i've never gotten a sunburn but I have to imagine rectal cancer is worse lol  I'm rooting for Barbara Lee, but Karen Bass will at least get me to not root against a Biden ticket
Same, Bass gets me to not root against Biden Barbara Lee gets me to root for a Biden ticket  Everyone else gets me to root against a biden ticket &amp; root for greens
I wish it were sooner too so this world can get back to normal. By the way, Trump is going to wipe the streets with Biden. Epic win...
2/ Are you telling me Bob Dole was not too ambitious in 1976?  Did GHW Bush express regret for "voodoo economics" in 1980?  What about Al Gore in 1992? Did he not have his eyes on the White House?  Jack Kemp in 1996?  John Edwards in 2004?  Heck, Biden lambased Obama in 2007-08.
Well, I was talking about Biden's team here, not the press.
I think you’re right  Trumps people will vote in person  Biden’s will vote by mail  But what does it all mean 🤣😂

“public health officials and senior US lawmakers are sounding alarms about the Trump administration’s lack of planning for its nationwide distribution.”
Chip in to elect Joe Biden
The Biden administration will have a lot to do.
That’s an asinine headline. Is Trump’s version what “really running” looks like?
Yep. When the Dems picked Biden I was like you have got to be fucking kidding me, we’re going to end up with 4 more years of Donald fucking Trump, aren’t we.
I’m not speaking to it’s quality, just the drop for Biden is interesting and noteworthy.  Also I’m out on 538, their analyses in 2016 were awful (not necessarily their fault).

Aka slime creature lobbyists are pissed because if Biden dies in office she will be potus and not cater to them. They’re very predictable. Old white dudes should retire this year. Go away. You’re wittingly and unwittingly destroying this country
Just a reminder to the many Trump supporters who say they won't accept the results if Biden wins... That is NOT up for debate. So build a bridge and get over it!!!
Polling among all age groups also finds strong opposition to abortion without restriction up to birth and taxpayer-funded abortions — the position that Biden now holds.
Joe Biden is struggling to reach religious voters. It’s hardly a surprise. Biden is a pro-abortion Democrat who opposes religious freedom – even for nuns — and wants to force taxpayers to pay for abortions.
`That was my first thought but you know, if you don’t vote, you don’t vote. If Biden wins, I’m fine with them sitting around the trailer park, crowing about how Trump would have won if...   Works for me.

That awkward moment when you’re in such pure shock from reading the words “Joe Biden” and “further left” in the same sentence that you don’t even finish reading the sentence correctly
“Joe Biden is further left than Bernie Sanders” is certainly a take
He said  “she’s 12 I’ve never been into that”
Kamala Harris has now answered these attacks, but Biden hasn’t.  Not a good look.
There are so many women who are prepared, experienced, highly capable, to lead this country and be potus. I’m not sure why you demand anything like this. I’m sure Biden knows his choice is important if something happens to him. Younger ppl die. JFK, Bobby Kennedy were murdered.
Bernie Sanders and AOC are already on record supporting this maggot's right to vote. Does their marionette, Joe Biden, agree? Better question: Will he ever be asked?
Yup. And ironically their solution is Joe “You know, the thing” Biden.

As usual, Trump supporters find ways to attack Biden, but never have a single positive Trump accomplishment to talk about. That's because there are none.
The video presentation during the Barr bearings prompted rhis no doubt. The democrats hate to see their agenda foiled by somerhing like video proof. The democrats had the same reaction when Biden was seen on video bragging about his quid pro quo violation.

Brown didnt “severely hamper” anything. He was notable only for having one time been a centerfold. He didnt do anything particularly controvesial and cast no swing votes.  The ACA was “hampered” by scared centrists that Biden as VP was able to push over the line.
Republicans want a stimulus extension of $1T. Democrats want more than $3T. If Biden is elected, and the Dems get control of both the Upper and Lower houses, get ready for extreme fiscal imprudence, and consequently, the implosion of the USD.
Joe Biden is president?
NYT article predicts Representative Karen Bass for VP, and explains why. If Joe thinks so, sounds good to me  😃
Hi, as an actual Mass resident, I can tell you it is 100% safe. The seat can be filled on Nov 3, and Brown was the first R senator in MA since the 1970’s.  I notice you say “almost” quite a lot as while ignoring it DID happen, in part bc VP Biden was whipping votes.
A lot of people don’t know much about Kaine.  He was an Obama guy.  Mayor of Richmond, Governor of Virginia, Senator of Virginia.  Hardly an unambitious loyalist.  But it’s whatever.  Biden is already the Tim Kaine figure.
Things f'ing exploded all right, and we still wanted Biden over Bernie four years later. I'll never forgive you,
Where is it taking place? How many people can social distance in Biden's basement?

They will manufacture “dirt” &amp; intentionally mislead. Barr will hold a press conf to deliver the msg they want. That will flood social media. Look at the crap abt Benghazi even after all the investigatns. The goal is to sway trump voters leaning twd Biden. If they’re still alive.

I'd like to co-sign as a white woman. The coverage of VP Biden's potential running mates is infuriating, particularly in the wake of 2016. Advisors/donors who are speaking &amp; leaking are hurting JB. They're not on his side, nor the country's. They're self-interested.
In his Biden interview, Ady Barkan reflected on the nominee's proposed budget for the NIH stating simply "I don't think that's enough." Watching him always moves me, but Ady having found in  someone whose "optimism and perseverance" ARE enough nearly brought me to tears.

So bad....I’ve tried to see things from the other side and I just can’t figure out their thought process. Bottom line is that they will do anything and everything to get him out of office. If he is voted back in, it will be 4 more years of the same. And Biden? God help us.

When Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 her staff went to high level jobs at Apple, Google, Twitter, and Facebook.  Think that explains why tech stocks moved the NASDAQ to  all time highs, why Apple is now the most valuable company (over a Trillion) in the world, &amp; why Biden may win?
Disagree.  I think Klobuchar, Bullock, Bennet, etc. would have been fine as far as ideology.  But none have strong connections w/ the African-American community.  And none have the moral authority of the Obama administration nor the biography of Joe Biden.
Biden’s wife should be charged with Elder abuse!!!
They can all go to hell, especially after Clinton having 3 million more votes in 2016. They inflicted this 4-year trauma on all of us, let them stew in their own paranoid delusions for the next 4-years while Biden and Democrats get shit done.
YES!!!!! If this is indeed the case I don’t think we’ll be seeing Donnie hanging around. He hates Joe Biden but he DEESSPIISES Nancy Pelosi.
Suddenly I’m less hopefully about the Veepstakes and feel so deflated.   Kamala has been working her ass off for Biden and to see her potentially derailed by weak white men threatened by her ambition is awful.    and  showed the type of people they are.
Not close to excited. I thought for sure Kamala now I am back to thinking Liz Warren give the very public bashing Kamala got from people close to Biden this week
But I feel like if you have to explain that I knew her at 12 and she was so “beautiful” (not pretty like most 12 yos are described) He was struck by it then say but when she turned 25... wink wink - still pervy
I agree with this. If I’m Biden I’m going with Harris and if not Harris then Duckworth. No reason to overthink it.   I love Warren but with things going the way they are (big lead, national pandemic) there’s no reason to give Trump &amp; his team such an obvious target / distraction
Trump administration does not even have to have chart every day Obama Biden during the swine clue refused to report cases because they said it was a pandemic and people where going to Die!!! Trump can even stop mass ted
Is this the right wing version of a vote for a spoiler is a vote for Trump (in this case Biden)?
Yes, this.  I mean I’m reading this articles and it’s like Biden is looking for a very quiet loyalist?🤔

Good, she should rub everyone the wrong way. Nobody gets to anyone without friction. And they're so worried about what she is capable of, it's beyond transparent

either option is shitty for Biden. Just like how this entire process has unfolded in the last 2-3 weeks. This all could have been much better. If he wanted it to...
are these series of Kamala is the reincarnation of the devil leaks from old white men a result of Biden already having told them she is the pick? And they dont like it?  Or Biden testing the waters to see if any of these slanders stick, thereby not selecting Kamala.

Not to mention, I make comments like this and not a single reply from Biden's social media team. It is as if they are using Twitter to lecture instead of engage with their audience – which is the purpose of the platform.
I do not plan to vote for Trump. As a marketer, Biden's marketing is just so horrible. None of his social appears remotely close to his own voice. And Marketing 101 is not to mention your competition – it just amplifies their voice. Worried about Biden's ability to communicate.
boy you aren't kidding. I have been noticing that they have been actively campaigning harder against Biden than actual Trumpers. Very "progressive" of them.
There’s been like 10 hit pieces.  People are gunning for Harris, and only Biden can put a stop to that.
honestly didn’t give enough credit to people’s ability to see right through JK3 so this is a nice recovery from the nihilism I got from watching puppets dragging Biden across the finish line
Thought we were talking about Biden&amp;Trump here. Calling it for what it is...is not hateful. Keeping quiet on Dems unending relentless pursuit to get rid ofTrump ever since he stepped into office &amp;yet pretending to be the victims when conservatives fight back. Don’t instigate then
When Joe Biden’s probably a rapist, not to mention a serial molester, the Democrats will have the rare distinction of electing an immoral pervert for President.  They always aspire to be the first idiots in every way...
I really don’t think most voters will care about that. Plus I don’t think her Castro comments are that bad and even still Biden’s the top of the ticket and is clearly doing well in Florida.   Also Kamala living in Canada for years is a vulnerability that hasn’t been tapped yet.

Biden isn't in the video. You'd think a presidential candidate would share his presidential action plans instead of running on the platform: The current president stinks.
I think the media is the one dragging this out. He already said months ago that he would make his decision in early August. They've been covering potential picks nonstop since Bernie dropped out of the race. I don't think that's Biden's fault. My 2 cents.
They're for anything that is corrupt! You would have to be brain dead to vote DemonRat.  Unless you want all your cities to a lawless jungle. If Demonrat voters could take a glimpse into the future if Biden was elected, they would regret it every day that they lived. 💯%FACT!!
Look at most recent CNBC poll.  Biden’s leads in battleground states have evaporated in ~1 week.  This election season has barely even started.
Who in your opinion enjoys greater investor confidence? Biden or Trump?   What does “Bracing up for Biden” mean for an average Wall St investor?
The Dems want this Bolshevik a heartbeat away from the presidency.    Karen Bass‘s Long March from Communist Fringe to Biden‘s VP Shortlist  via
Bernie couldn’t have been more explicit that he would sheepdog for the eventual winner again, and he’s doing it avidly. But if Biden manages to lose, the Dem chorus will be “Bernie did nothing to help Biden and his toxic Bros love Trump,” not that it matters.
The July 15 attack compromised the accounts of some of its most high profile users, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk and former Vice President Joe Biden.
I saw Bernie as a worthwhile compromise with some chance of getting elected. His sheepdogging history preceded him but is now more flagrant than ever. Mostly I’m seeing Berners not following him into active support for Biden.
Listening to covid19 hearings, it seems to me that, 1. Trump denied covid19 when it mattered most 2. Trump failed to listen to experts 3. Trump held unsafe rallies, Hermain Cain died 4. Trump has no plan.  5. Trump has killed 153,000 plus Americans.
Barbara Lee for VP!
Lmao | FLASHBACK: Conservatives attacked Joe Biden for predicting Trump would try to delay the 2020 election – Raw Story -
Keep national Security leaks to a minimum would be nice. Also I don’t want to hear any slander. Keep personal opinions about others out. It’s never personal. It’s for the people. Mr. Biden best of luck. You’ve got 1 vote here
Joe Biden narrows down his VP list, with Karen Bass emerging as one of several key contenders
You know what’s also unjustifiable Mr. Biden? Touching kids. 🖕
VILE, DISTURBING, DISGUSTING. These are not words that should be associated with any #POTUS.
Yah.....always believe the trafficker who brought underage girls to the rapist. #GhislaineMaxwell
Oh they don’t care what Biden does or did lol they just want Trump out lol..it quite sad actually wanting a pedo in there because you hate the President so much
is a blatant admission there’s no positive case for biden, and as i’ve shown, there’s barely a negative one if you compare him to trump honestly  why don’t you fuck off and do something useful
Biden would forgive all undergraduate “tuition-related” student debt for borrowers who earn less than $125,000 a year and attended public community colleges or four-year institutions.
Biden is on a roll. #GhislaineMaxwell #Outnumbered
Shaming the left into voting for a representative of american hegemony, and the neoliberal elite won't do anything. Go convince those mythical undecided moderates that Biden supporters swore anyone left of of Biden would scare off to Trump.
Biden allies try to wreck Kamala Harris' vice presidential chances with tired, sexist attacks
climate change isn’t any better under biden than trump. the party supports fracking and will not act in time to avert catastrophe
This article is basically telephone in written form. None of the "sources" are remotely close to Biden or know what he's going to do, but you media folks will continue to push anyone but Warren for VP
I guess you could say I’m a Trump hating Biden hater.
My feelings about Biden weren’t clear from “F your tweets?” The man is literally incapable of giving the public anything more than “Trump sucks, I’d be better.”
Fuck Biden too tho
It’s Ann Jones
which millions  you can’t even stand strong on the narrow-ass plank of you’ve put yourself on  biden’s inactions are likely to be worse than his actions, and you still can’t make a decent case
* may or may not be a bigger racist  also Bloomberg, Kerry, and Larry Summers are Epstein guys on Biden’s staff so you’re not outta the woods there either
Actually  Trump v Biden is:  Russia v America
The numbers show it: Biden is winning the presidential race by not really running
These outstanding individuals would have profited more if their father was NOT President. You are projecting Killary and Biden's crimes . Nice try. Won't work.
i’m saying biden’s health care policy is a sham, his immigration/policing policies will be the same or worse, his foreign policy is likely to need much worse, and there’s a chance he gets real cuts to the social safety net that the republican party doesn’t seem as interested in
hi i’d rather be phonebanking for one of Susan Collins’ challengers or Biden but here i am
Oh I agree. I joined a pro trump fb page that my trumptard bro follows, just to spy. They are telling people to say they are voting for Biden in the polls so that D’s will believe it’s a huge margin and the fear of corona will make people think it’s ok to stay home in November 3!
fuck ‘party unity’, fuck the  fuck the two party system, fuck corporate money in politics, fuck any policy that does not focus on lifting up working citizens living in this hell hole country. burn it all down fam. and fuck people who don’t like cats.
I'm no fan of Biden, but bitter #NeverBiden dead-enders are no better than Dems whose entire politics are based only on opposing Trump.  The left's hope for national-level power died on Super Tuesday. Gotta let it go and focus on base-building: unions, tenant organizing, locals
So let's use a little bit of basic logic.   A Republican told me that "unless you vote for the Republican nominee, you're voting for Joe Biden."  Which one of you is wrong?  Let me help: BOTH of you are.  Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.  👋🏾
Aren’t we at an 11% unemployment rate? Obama and Biden were at 4.7% when they handed it over to Trump and he screwed it all up.
Biden is a clown. He's a demented pull string toy.
Pompeo hit with subpoena after he’s caught assisting Senate GOP’s political smear of Biden
biden has written, supported, and passed more fascist policy than trump  mostly because he’s been in office longer, but that’s part of my point
I think Biden's campaign will see it.
SHUTDOWN MASSACHUSETTS AGAIN! Cancel debt and stop evictions, foreclosures, and shutoffs for the duration of the #COVID19 emergency. Pay people to #StayHome. Tax the rich. Wear a face covering. Vote for progressives up and down the ballot and also Joe Biden.
i hate biden just as much, i’m saying get a talking point that actually draws a distinction between the two
Anybody who supports Biden and misses Obama is Anti America. 7-12-16 go back and listen to the Dallas memorial that Obama spoke at worst than anything Trump has ever said ! Trump might be a clown at times but world leaders fear him and work with him. Obama is EVIL..... and so r u

tbf, Joe Biden is racist AF  His handlers probably didn't want to risk another 'viral' moment.
And yet somehow ignored or worsened by Biden.
From a person who supplied zero facts . Hydroxy works , BLM is never in the inner cities , Biden is a racist. All facts !  Oh and calling someone a minority is nor racist. You just made that up.Take off the 10 pounds of makeup you wear and maybe it will help your thought pattern
Hi nice to meet you. Great to meet others trying to get trump out and loving animals. My main reason for being here is animals but this year is also to get trump out! Have a great weekend!
Oh..wait...you said 2020? Joe Biden has come out for repeal of Hyde and no, I don't approve of anyone supporting it in the past.
😂 you’re really using Biden’s children as ammunition? What a joke!
when is joe biden?
I thought Biden was going to sell Utah to the Chinese, and replace the Lincoln memorial with a 90 ft statue of Ho Chi Minh?
Word? You think having 4 of the other candidates immediately side with Biden after falling out WASNT significant or having the DNC pratically disown Bernie to upkept the democratic “ideology”, they wanted...it’s always deeper than just the surface and YOU KNOW THATPlease Biden select your VP so I stop getting "WHO'S YOUR PICK FOR VP????" fundraiser emails.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Come on, you can’t be seriously comparing Joe Biden to malicious dictator-in-training
Imagine that.  Who would have thought that Joe Biden had these thoughts...
No. 94 crime bill. Written by Biden. Patriot Act. Yeah that was Biden. The democrats have given Trump just about everything he wants. Caging children happened when Biden was VP. The neoliberal capitalists gave us Trump. Biden gave us Trump. Biden is far right.
Biden's not a pedophile.   Just another projection from Trump the sexual predator/rapist/sex trafficker.  #TrumpThreatensAmerica
Biden isn't going to make those changes. He has always been a republic dressed with a D, and for some reason, you believe the democrats are the good guys even though they keep moving further and further right. Biden is a known pathological liar.
The treatment of Bernie and other outsider candidates by the party and their cohorts will drive  many embittered voters to not pull the lever for Biden IMO
It has nothing to do with the "lesser of two evils." Hillary is a democrat. Biden is a democrat. That's reason enough to never vote for either one of them. Democrats are cancer.

Magical thinking. Dangerously negligent. BIDEN 2020
By your "logic" Joe Biden should disqualify himself. He's associated with the Catholic Church for years despite it's "clear history of abuse." But hey, have fun tearing down an accomplished black women with a hit piece sourced to a right wing rag founded by Tucker Carlson.
I live in Mass. I’ve seen project Lincoln commercials and Biden commercials but zero Trump commercials.
Jon, your side was cheated when Bernie didn’t get it. I dislike Bernie’s policies but not him. Seems very affable. Wild as a young Rep, but honest. Very honest. Biden is a freak mannequin bullshit artist. Can’t do it ever.
Heard "9 to 5" on the Biden-Warren call and sighed so heavily that my wife tapped my knee. #WarrenForVP
Biden is sad old dog that wants to sleep all day and pees around the house by accident.
Lololololol.  Biden would have to be left for him to do that. He's far-right.
This dude disgusts me. The fact that settle for Biden is a slogan is so fvcking gross. People like  clearly do not understand why it is we have Trump. Let me tell you. It's Biden.
I think she blew her chances when she attacked Biden during one of the debates. I too believe she wud be great on the ticket but look for Stacey Abrams

absolutely are the parallels between now and late 1920s/early 1930s Germany too on the nose.  Biden is still auth-right.  everyone in this election, and every US election for a century, has been auth-right, except Sanders, maybe Nader, do we get to Teddy for lib-right?

"Evanina (Dir. NCSC) ultimately acknowledged that Russia is again trying to boost President Donald Trump’s reelection and denigrate his opponent, the presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, sources who attended the briefing said."
1. This conversation is about the First Lady. 2. Biden has been concerned about the people of the United States for a lot longer than Twitter has even existed.
The fact of the matter is that this is NOT the time for liberals to be criticizing the Dem candidate. By all means, do so as soon as soon as we take back the white house. But doing anything other than offering full throated support for Biden only serves to help Trump
I think it is important to keeping a Democrat in the WH that Biden tee up his VP to run in 2024. And for that reason he should pick Kamala Harris
once should keep an eye on senate seats in swing states - MT, NC, GA, IA. If GOP thinks it cannot salvage presidency,  may tinker with senate elections (various ways to cheat and other countries can oblige) to keep senate in their control and obstruct any Biden agenda.
Joe Biden is up by 10 in every poll, though. Why would any of his stans ever care about VP, he's a shoo-in!

As I’ve said before, the debate kerfuffle was always going to be the toughest issue to get over, but she is still going to be the VP candidate.  No one else seems plausible, IMHO.
She is a republican. Don’t spread her trash and let Biden  make his choice..all the women are top notch.

If Biden's VP pick is suppose to succeed him as the next President, it should probably be someone Democrats already want to be President like Warren or Harris. If most voters will need to be introduced to the VP like Tim Kaine was, it's a missed opportunity for Biden.

In terms of the voting blocs in the recent primary, I think Markey will get all of Sanders, much of Warren, and some of Biden. Kennedy will get much of Biden, some of Warren, and none of Sanders. I like Ed’s chances.

Polling among all age groups also finds strong opposition to abortion without restriction up to birth and taxpayer-funded abortions — the position that Biden now holds.
Joe Biden is struggling to reach religious voters. It’s hardly a surprise. Biden is a pro-abortion Democrat who opposes religious freedom – even for nuns — and wants to force taxpayers to pay for abortions.

There are so many women who are prepared, experienced, highly capable, to lead this country and be potus. I’m not sure why you demand anything like this. I’m sure Biden knows his choice is important if something happens to him. Younger ppl die. JFK, Bobby Kennedy were murdered.

Brown didnt “severely hamper” anything. He was notable only for having one time been a centerfold. He didnt do anything particularly controvesial and cast no swing votes.  The ACA was “hampered” by scared centrists that Biden as VP was able to push over the line.
Republicans want a stimulus extension of $1T. Democrats want more than $3T. If Biden is elected, and the Dems get control of both the Upper and Lower houses, get ready for extreme fiscal imprudence, and consequently, the implosion of the USD.
Joe Biden is president?
NYT article predicts Representative Karen Bass for VP, and explains why. If Joe thinks so, sounds good to me  😃
Hi, as an actual Mass resident, I can tell you it is 100% safe. The seat can be filled on Nov 3, and Brown was the first R senator in MA since the 1970’s.  I notice you say “almost” quite a lot as while ignoring it DID happen, in part bc VP Biden was whipping votes.
Things f'ing exploded all right, and we still wanted Biden over Bernie four years later. I'll never forgive you,

So bad....I’ve tried to see things from the other side and I just can’t figure out their thought process. Bottom line is that they will do anything and everything to get him out of office. If he is voted back in, it will be 4 more years of the same. And Biden? God help us.

When Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 her staff went to high level jobs at Apple, Google, Twitter, and Facebook.  Think that explains why tech stocks moved the NASDAQ to  all time highs, why Apple is now the most valuable company (over a Trillion) in the world, &amp; why Biden may win?
Biden’s wife should be charged with Elder abuse!!!
They can all go to hell, especially after Clinton having 3 million more votes in 2016. They inflicted this 4-year trauma on all of us, let them stew in their own paranoid delusions for the next 4-years while Biden and Democrats get shit done.
YES!!!!! If this is indeed the case I don’t think we’ll be seeing Donnie hanging around. He hates Joe Biden but he DEESSPIISES Nancy Pelosi.
Suddenly I’m less hopefully about the Veepstakes and feel so deflated.   Kamala has been working her ass off for Biden and to see her potentially derailed by weak white men threatened by her ambition is awful.    and  showed the type of people they are.
Not close to excited. I thought for sure Kamala now I am back to thinking Liz Warren give the very public bashing Kamala got from people close to Biden this week
But I feel like if you have to explain that I knew her at 12 and she was so “beautiful” (not pretty like most 12 yos are described) He was struck by it then say but when she turned 25... wink wink - still pervy
I agree with this. If I’m Biden I’m going with Harris and if not Harris then Duckworth. No reason to overthink it.   I love Warren but with things going the way they are (big lead, national pandemic) there’s no reason to give Trump &amp; his team such an obvious target / distraction
Trump administration does not even have to have chart every day Obama Biden during the swine clue refused to report cases because they said it was a pandemic and people where going to Die!!! Trump can even stop mass ted
and this is on top of all the voter suppression that Democrats let Republicans get away with uncontested because it helped Biden win the primary
So you're saying people can get free healthcare and still hate brown people? if you're planning on giving the South to Biden in November this is a good start
Free legal advice, first one to start snacking does not die in federal prison. I suggest you get to Biden's attorney general and make a deal before Devin Nunes does
Thank you for all you do.  We get it &amp; we can’t let up.  And now we learn 👉🏼NUNES was sent info frm a pro-Russia source in Ukraine.  👉🏼 Trump wanted “dirt” on Biden 2release b4 election. He got impeached for that...GOP doesn’t care. They’re STILL soliciting foreign election help.
: WAIT A MINUTE ... Do you mean to tell us that you DID have a plan?!?  You mean that the Obama/Biden administration actually DID LEAVE YOU A PLAN?!?  And you threw it away??????  YOU ALL OWN EVERY ONE OF THE 150,000+ AMERICAN DEATHS!  *
JFC, at least people know who Kamala Harris is. Karen Bass has no name recognition outside her district and the beltway. Meanwhile both of these women are from a California, a state Biden will win easily.  I’m so disappointed that Stacey Abrams isn’t being talked about now.
Good, she should rub everyone the wrong way. Nobody gets to anyone without friction. And they're so worried about what she is capable of, it's beyond transparent
Trump makes me more excited about voting for Biden than Biden does.
Dems Subpoena Pompeo In Probe Of Senate GOP Biden-Ukraine Disinfo Campaign | Talking Points Memo   Just in time for summer reruns, trump will forbid ⁦ from complying with the House
ok, i won’t
Black people where? Portland? Seattle? Chicago has a rich Governor Pritzker  who can put everyone in a Hyatt hotel. NYC is run by a money launderer. Keep riding with Biden. 😂🤡Biden needs to pick who he thinks will be the best governing partner. Plus he has reviewed all the vetting material so he has access to info that isn’t available to the rest of us. We should trust him and support h no matter who he chooses
It's entirely possible. It's also maybe predicated on the belief that the Dems wouldn't be able to respond to an economic catastrophe New Deal-style because of the filibuster.  And I thought too Biden would never go along with ditching it until Obama endorsed that yesterday.
What did Biden say, Trump is a xenophobia. None of these clowns took it serious back then the only one who did was TRUMP.
Trump failed? He was ahead of it all, He shut down travel from China and from Europe way before Doctor Fauci, the CDC, Democrats , Pelosi, Biden even took Covid serious. What did they say about the Travel ban? Fauci it's not needed. Pelosi, go to china town hug upon people.

Biden Campaign Is SINKING As 75% of Swing Voters TURN THEIR BACKS On Joe!  via
Listen to "Barr, Big Tech and Biden's Brain Freeze!" by Trumped Up. ⚓
I feel sorry for the person that has to translate what Biden says into sign language.
It's not wishful thinking. The problem is that there's going to be a civil war WITHIN the military because many of the rank and file and top brass despise him. There's even a backup football, so theoretically you could have both Biden and Trump with the nuclear codes.
Donald Trump should be arrested if Joe Biden gets elected this November. A corruptive racist lying toddler!!!
I think Biden will do fine! Even Texas is smart enough to know the truth! Go Texas lol!
I think voters' minds are already made up. Barr's bullshit is made for an electorate of 35%. The game changer is Barr's DOJ arresting Biden on some bullshit charges. It's possible.
Wouldn’t it be great if Biden shocks the world and picks Michelle Obama or Hillary Clinton as his VP?   People would go nuts.
Biden Speach! He had the nerve to say  he never lied to the people! He also gave a platform that repeated the Republican platform! He spent 8 years with Obama supporting a series of lies and biggest one the Ukrain and China deal!#Biden.
It's very sad and pathetic that you have fun with this. Putting others down is a hobby of yours I see. You live in a fantasy land if you think Biden aka child sniffer can handle this country. I believe you have shown to be the small minded one by NOT thinking outside the box.

I agree. The time between the election and Biden's inauguration will be horrific.
You wanted to nuke a hurricane and have us shoot up with disinfectant, yet you call Biden senile
Joe Biden needs to be POTUS... he will respond to the issues, not ignore them.

Tulsi as vp would definitely make it more palatable for me to vote for Biden.
It’s much easier to sit and critic from the sidelines! I bet Biden doesn’t even remember making that tweet. Actually, I bet he doesn’t even remember what he ate fro breakfast! Wake up and stop supporting rapists and peodphiles thanks
Obama and Biden.  Geniuses.
If Biden wins the election do you think he will  be in charge or will it be the VP pick or Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer?
Who's president now? Who ordered this? Why are you talking about Joe Biden?

I agree. That’s it. I agree. She just seems like she’s also really comfortable with Biden.
if this was a guy being blocked from entering a hospital (it's not, it's a landlord being blocked from entering an eviction court) Joe Biden would say it was okay because he still had *access* to healthcare
this is one of the rankings that i do on youtube. none of the data i look at has biden even close.
Aww biased data - no wonder.. you think for half a second joe Biden is going to say how great Trump is? 😂 Where do you think there publications get their money from legacy OEMs. If you want to actually understand whats gonna on you'll have to do a way better job..
Guess she needed a bigger platform to say metoo has gone too far when Biden got called out 🙃

President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, both promise sweeping progress over the next four years –- via starkly different paths.
hating on Biden.  Jealous in some funny. But feels good way ...it bothers you .lol
we just had 8 years of Obama, republicans weren’t about to let a dem take office. But I personally don’t think they would have used Biden as he was very strongly against being president in 2016.  people were calling for him to run but he had just lost his son to cancer; grieving.
And also would Biden even be running if he did not feel the pressure from the left to take down Trump?
Hear hear  Anarchists are good, actually, and Joe Biden is a new Nixon
President Donald Trump is painting a dystopian portrait of what Joe Biden’s America might look like, asserting crime and chaos would ravage communities should the former vice president win the White House in November.
Fake new family .theres nothing real about you or you family. The admin see through some trash you spew but they are scared to loose their jobs so they lie for you.....SAD ADMIN .2020.BIDEN

Right? The media maybe should have disclaimers. What you about to watch doesn't represent reality or the truth or any objective version of reality. Media is such a joke reporting Biden has any chance
My faith in this company ranges over 15 years but is legit shook. I have many a shirt and sent many a donation. But  seemed genuinely hurt. I was shocked to learn that PFT turned down an interview with Biden.  could have done the same with Trump.
