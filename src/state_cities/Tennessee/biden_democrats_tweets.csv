Biden is beating the üí© out of Trump on mail-in ballots.  Majority of people are NOT stupid.
Where the heck are you getting this?    You are 45% &amp; Biden is 48%. LIAR‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è
Biden knows what it takes to be POTUS-His choice will be based on that issue probably more than ever before. I've always been a Kamala supporter. But I have a lot of trust in Biden's decision here. It will be the opposite in terms of vetting, etc from McCain's decision on Palin.
Biden would bring this country into total divide and chaos. He will destroy America as we know it.

That is a beautiful 'Tang! I'm,a Biden supporter also. But I luve in NE TN.....and as a Dem, have always felt safer without bumper stickers. Be very careful.
You are just like #45.  A big LIAR.  Biden is not seeking to defund the police.
President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, both promise sweeping progress over the next four years ‚Äì- via starkly different paths.
You, little Donny, was posting (not too long ago) that Biden had not stated anything about Covid-19.  This is the job of CDC
As Biden VP pick nears, Susan Rice slams Trump for being soft on Russia's Putin
Harris will steamroll Biden.  He has one one foot in the nursing home.
So you talk üí© about Biden NOT speaking to news media &amp; answering questions.  When he does, you talk üí©.  He called your bluff &amp; succeeded.  YOU CAN‚ÄôT HANDLE IT‚ÄºÔ∏è
Yeah and her picks them all even Acosta. Biden handlers make his list and give the reporters parameters of what they can and can't ask. Plus stop the cameras and interviews when he started going off script...
Lol softball interview, you're hilarious.... Biden gets to pick which reporter to call on and has set limits to questions...
I guess when Biden does the Wallace interview...
Write in  as Presidential nominee and then  could pick  as running mate. Unfortunately the news media selects who are candidates are‚Äîremember Trump? Sorry, Biden has had his shot. Anyone else for term limits for Congress and Senate?
#Biden can‚Äôt actually rem this tho.
Talkin' about star power!!!!!  Obama and George Clooney to hold virtual fundraiser for Biden
Biden can‚Äôt spell ‚Äúgas‚Äù.
But Mrs. Biden may not like your changes!
The Biden strategy is an interesting one. We all know that he‚Äôs running so there‚Äôs really no need to seriously campaign. He‚Äôs just laying in the weeds and letting Trump fail on his own. And it seems to be working.
And what is wrong with Biden reviewing &amp; working with Sanders or anyone on policies?  #45 lets his administration write his policies.
This isn‚Äôt Biden‚Äô‚Äôs America. It‚Äôs all...
His staff is so afraid of what Biden will say that their going to attempt keeping him out of any debates. This says it all.
For all Americans and                                JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Satan wants Biden!
Desperate are you?
And where‚Äôs the proof that Biden agreed?  Pelosi was in Chinatown bec it is in the USA &amp; have businesses there.  You ruined these tax paying businesses. Hell, she wasn‚Äôt in the country of China.
You Dems are id1ots..... talk about someone that talks the talk but can't Walk It is your Empty vessel Joe Biden. He had 8 years to do something and couldn't produce. Not to mention his dementia, vote for him and y'all have driven the last nail into this country.
I don‚Äôt think Joe Biden knows the truth about what color his own socks are today!!!!!
It‚Äôs funny how biden and Warren are also taking money from those same corporations isn‚Äôt it ?? ü§îü§î
Many folks on Twitter have very strong opinions on Biden's choice as a running mate. I urge everyone to read this editorial.
Every single person that supports Biden you search for dirt, mostly lies.  Hope Biden starts doing the same on the Trumps.
What a literal dumb fuck. YOUR president is doing this. Biden would never as he appears to actually respect the constitutional rights of American citizens.Clyburn will take Biden to the White house.  He will be on media along with Obama.  Let's March for our future!
I so hope you are right. I cried when Kamala dropped out of the presidential race. I have been holding onto the hope that Biden will pick her.
had a great article  about Rice being the best choice to insulate BHO &amp; Biden from the Durham investigation and boom just like that this damaging news drops on COMMA LA.   I also think the ‚Äúaccidental‚Äù announcement by Politco may have been on purpose.
When eventual nominee Michael Dukakis learned of his staff‚Äôs involvement in pushing the plagiarism scandal, they were promptly fired and Dukakis issued an apology to Biden.   It would be 20 years before Joe attempted to run again.
95 Days. Joe‚Äôs not an unblemished candidate. There‚Äôs gobs of missteps and gaffes over his almost five decades in public service. What‚Äôs important: he owns up to his mistakes and learns.  Today‚Äôs example: Joe‚Äôs first run for President (1988).
Why aren‚Äôt they making as much noise about getting info from the State Dept about Biden that was given to Johnson and Grassley?
Biden please choose Kamala Harris!!! #KamalaHarris #KamalaHarrisForVP
choosing Karen Bass for VP would be a HUGE mistake. Her past working with the Venceremos Brigade in Castro‚Äôs Cuba will bring on the GOP calls of ‚ÄúSocialism‚Äù that seemed to go away after Biden won. #BidenVPChoice #KarenBass
Well, if Biden wins you‚Äôre gonna be pissed off within 1st 100 days. I look at it this way, not one President in my lifetime has cared as much as Trump. Sure he has faults , but doesn‚Äôt every person on earth?! Biden cannot and will not get us back on our feet. He‚Äôs made that clear
Why not poll Biden supporters on same question? since, ya know they didn‚Äôt accept 2016 results, weaponized FBI &amp; IC to spy on rival campaign in attempt to take out duly elected POTUS &amp; obstruct peaceful transition of power.
It‚Äôs not the mail Josh. You know that. The mail is metaphor for the same democrats that have been wasting time trying to eliminate this president since before he took office. Starting with Obama/Biden spying on his campaign. Wait, you‚Äôre not paperless Josh? I am. Bad liberal.
Yes they will show up in record numbers and Joe Biden will be our new president.
Yes and in a short time he will be delivering his congratulatory speech to Joe Biden.  He is so done
You know that strategic activism has been *proven* to work, right? Which is exactly what orgs like  have been doing. That‚Äôs why  had a seat at the table on Biden‚Äôs climate team, and thank God she did.
Didn't Biden say that same thing to Charlemagne ??
Biden winning will empower the rioters to go in for the kill.
They're psyched to retool for Biden's VP pick when they can go full misogyny. It worked before! üò°
Maybe next time ask the question without sounding like you're making a big deal about him not being there. Perhaps say, "I'm curious about Biden not being there."
Yes a few! They are not vocal but they told me they won‚Äôt vote for him again. A lot of evangelicals. Not voting for Biden either, but IDK at least it‚Äôs something to not vote for trump.

He got this wrong, too. "Biden instead accused the president of trying to make it harder for people to vote by mail by defunding or otherwise hindering the Postal Service‚Äôs operations."

Carlson: Big Tech Engaging in Censorship on Coronavirus to Help Biden
Well, well, well. Biden strikes again!!
He passes by the teleprompter to look at the guy! BTW there are 2 teleprompters .
Good luck with that if Biden gets elected! Just remember you voted against your own well being
I actually agree with your reasoning.  Biden and Congressional sweep will lead to overreach.   Grid lock is underrated.
We love you, Vice President Biden!
Joe Biden has not had an original thought his entire career!
This is just for laughsüòÇ Joe Biden is and has always been... you obvious are not successful in ‚ÄúTV‚Äù if you could not see today for what it was.
Oh really!!? Joe Biden cannot answer simple questions without reading from a teleprompter.  My favorite no teleprompter moment ‚ÄúWe believe I truth over facts‚Äù or ‚Äú We believe these truths to be self evident you know the THING!‚Äù ‚Äú keep the record player on at night‚Äù
Biden was given questions by reporters so he could answer the questions from a teleprompter! You cannot be serious!
Joe Biden was given the questions prior to the news conference so he could read answers given to him by other people on a teleprompter! PATHETIC!
Joe Biden was given the questions prior to the news conference so he could answer questions given to him by other people on a teleprompter!
Joe Biden was given the questions prior to the conference so he could read the answers from a teleprompter!
Yes! Biden is the one with problems! Trump does NOT get questions beforehand and does not use a teleprompter to answer.
There were no tough questions they were given beforehand so he could respond with answers from a teleprompter! This man has no idea what is going on! Go review the video
He was reading his answers from the teleprompter! He walked over because he could not hear this was embarrassing!
Joe Biden just did a press conference where he was given the questions beforehand so he could answer from a teleprompter! YOU CANNOT BE SERIOUS!
The media giving Joe Biden the questions beforehand  so he can answer from a teleprompter is UNBELIEVABLE!!!!
What we are watching from the media is SHOCKING! They are giving Joe Biden the questions beforehand so he can read the answers off a teleprompter! Scary! This man CANNOT be President!
Are you watching this press conference with Joe Biden!? This man cannot answer a question without a teleprompter! Can you believe our media is going along with this??! THIS IS DISGRACEFUL! The media submitted the questions beforehand so he could read off a teleprompter!
I agree with you, Cheri.  In ‚Äònon-Trump‚Äô polls (üòÅ) it shows Biden w/healthy leads. however, the Dems cannot afford to rest &amp; miss opps to speak to the issues. They also need to be sure to be fighting &amp; not letting  ,  , etc. do it for them.
Watching mold grow on bread has more energy than a Biden speech.
Biden is reading from a TELEPROMPTER! Biden cannot answer questions impromptu they are given before so answers can be loaded into teleprompter. ARE YOU KIDDING!!!!??? Be serious!
You mean "Hiden Biden" Please you are a bad joke.

Biden can't even identify which of his fingers is the pinky finger
Were you &amp; your accountants watching Trump economy? Historic until pandemic.  Look at NYC slaughterhouse - that‚Äôs COVID19 under Biden.  Have you seen Chicago violence? That‚Äôs criminal justice under Biden.  Have you seen Portland/Minneapolis? That‚Äôs every USA city under Biden.
I skip them as soon as I can. Most that ive seen are about Biden wanting to defund the police etc.
WARNING: Biden is getting a smaller percentage of the Black vote than Hillary did.
YES! You have to win within the system you have, even if you don't like the system. It's 100% guaranteed Joe Biden will win the popular vote in November, but it doesn't matter if he doesn't matter if he doesn't win the necessary number of electoral college votes.

The hope I have is the independents who voted for Trump in 2016 are willing to gladly vote for Biden this year. They are sick of Trumps lies tweets and I bet some FL and TX GOP voters don‚Äôt care to die for our dictator in chief. GOP who lost family to covid19 might be anti Trump
‚ÄúWho is this Biden guy I keep hearing about?‚Äù - Joe Biden
What does the city Mayor have to do with it? We have a Republican President and this is happening now. How does a Democratic President change that?   It just continues for the next 6 months while Trump gives Mariano a reach around and then it‚Äôs Biden fault, is that the play?
for the past 4 years?
burning down a statue of an elk is not protesting.  but portland has had these shthole ppl for years.  this has nothing to do with police brutality or racial harmony. this has to do with power and taking over.   these ppl are thugs.

Your going to ruin this country.  It will be a rigged election.  Our country is doomed with BidenA 3rd party vote isn't a vote for Trump or Biden.  A 3rd party voter wasn't going to vote for either of those 2 anyway.
Does Trump realize all our troops that are not home do Mail in ballets? This man is not right!!! He‚Äôs just not!! I live in Memphis Tenn. in the SOUTH &amp; a Democrat! Alot of the South are REPUBLICANS I WAS until Barack Obama &amp; from then on DEMOCRATE. You have to win Mr. Joe Biden!
For who tho? Bc Biden is literally no better
I will vote Biden
Apparently the ‚Äútiming of the Zoom‚Äù only hinders Biden
Vote Biden 2020 trump is fired
Yes vote Biden 2020 and get rid of traitor trump
Extreme Embarrassment to our country &amp; the rule of law.  Dems call a lynching without a rope - almost as dumb as a candidate for Pres without a brain. Why would Dems ever put this in Nadler's hands? Or worse, in Biden's?
Biden will help us trump is killing us
So if Biden wins, Harris becomes our new President - just let that soak in for a moment - then either stay home or go vote for Trump.
I am voting for Biden
Biden just said today he would lock down every state until Covid is gone. He is crazy!
Too easy? Where has Biden been? Not answering questions, avoiding press, trying to remember he‚Äôs running for office. All‚Äôs well. I hope you guys are all staying safe.
just thinking about how my uncle said ‚Äúthey should have gone with joe biden‚Äù in 2008 and now he‚Äôs a diehard trump supporter
That's Joe Biden touching children on Camera. Sick Joe Biden.
Joe Biden, don't know what day it is...(lol)
The election is not going to trend. Once you drag old man Joe Biden. I laugh every time I hear how far Joe Biden is leading you in the polls. You can't live in the basement and be the president.
Kamala has been going around the country like Flo-Jo ever since she dropped out of the race. Creating bills and advocating for Joe Biden. She deserves respect!
Some people do not need to bring up such pettiness. Do we need a dictator (Trump ) or do we need a person that is compassionate &amp; WON‚ÄôT let our Unite States be destroyed like it is being done today! Yes we need JOE BIDEN to run our country ( AMERICAN ) !!!
AMEN AMEN!!!  We need someone named Joe Biden!!
I hope Kamala Harris is Biden VP
I did. Never in my life have I. This time I did. Chip in to elect Joe #Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
Biden shouldn't do anything to distract from Trump destroying himself.
Basement Biden, still in hiding and ducking interviews. America will not tolerate a coward as President.
Biden, what a joke. He is afraid to do an interview withChris Wallace. If he can‚Äôt handle this, he can‚Äôt handle being President.
This is what happens when Biden‚Äôs news source is CNN üôÑüôÑ
I don‚Äôt.  Biden is comfortable enough in lead that he will go for the safe choice. But he can‚Äôt go with a moderate white woman, because that would be a bridge too far.  Harris has high levels of support in Black community as a whole, it‚Äôs the younger voters against her.
we must defeat trump at all costs, the worst president of all time, the source of all evil etc etc etc, but can anyone actually tell me *policy* prescriptions (not platitudes like ‚Äúhe believes in sCiEnCe!!) of biden‚Äôs that would change the state of things AT ALL
the real story is that biden‚Äôs team of advisors is made up of ‚Äò90s welfare reform sickos who reinforced this arrangement and wouldn‚Äôt run it any differently!
We all will be able to relax when Biden starts fixing what trump messed up
Yes no longer trust it until trump is gone and Biden fixes it
School Choice! Economy! US Manufacturing and Pharmaceutical Companies! Basically, what he has been trying to do, without the help of Congress...and just keep preaching how Biden has been in office half a Century and has done nothing!
Something known only to Joe Biden.
‚ÄúBeat Biden Off‚Äù ...Not the image I wanted üò≠
Yes Biden 2020
Careful - if Biden is elected, his VP will be President within a year.
It's the folks propping up Biden who really want suburbs turned into ghettos. People like AOC, Booker, Pelosi, along with many others. It's disgusting. They want everyone else to live in poverty while they remain rich. That's socialism.
Obama didn‚Äôt endorse  PUBLICLY until later because he didn‚Äôt want to sway anyone‚Äôs opinion!! There‚Äôs people that didn‚Äôt like Obama but would support Biden.    is smart. Unlike trump who doesn‚Äôt seem to understand political strategies.Yet he‚Äôs the president?
Do we really need to read about Biden's fantasies? What a üí©brain..o wait that's to high a level of intelligence..what a üí©face.
Trump doesn't give a Damn about our Veterans. But, Joe Biden does!! #JoeBidenForPresident2020
So Biden chooses to ignore Woodrow Wilson and LBJ?  Both Democrats.  And how about himself?  He is also quite the racist, is he not?
How pathetic Biden hides in his basement from America. He is scared to come out because he might screw up. He lets his campaign aides write his tweets he is only to glad to plagiarize.
And you know this how, Jack. You're not a neurologist, but an eye doc by training. So what qualifies YOU to cast such a medical opinion. Thought you were talking about #SleepyJoe Biden, actually. Your shoe fits that iteration...Trump stepped off Air Force One in Tampa today (Friday), walked to a lectern and painted a dark picture of America that would be overrun by terrorists, gangs and China if former Vice President Joe Biden is elected in November.
I used my personal email address to sign up for mailing lists for both Biden and Trump. I get very few from Biden, but multiple emails a day from Trump. What‚Äôs your experience with campaign email?
So many would be investigated. We can‚Äôt let this ride if biden wins.
Clyburn will take Biden to the White house.  He will be on media along with Obama.  Let's March for our future!
It appears this might be Biden‚Äôs VP pick
No . . . I'm voting Biden/Harris as I planned.
I feel like Biden is getting in his head that he‚Äôs like the new Obama when really he‚Äôs just the ‚Äúnot a racist orange monster‚Äù candidate
Feigning enthusiasm for Biden‚Äôs impending VP announcement or really anything Biden related
Please follow the Biden Republicans! They deserve our support!!
ok i heard this somewhere today and it  put into words perfectly why i'm half heartedly voting for biden: unless the screwed up electoral system we have is going to be dismantled by november, he's the only option
Well, I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre getting a Biden/Bass ticket
I dream of a world where Biden picks the person he thinks us best and everyone shuts up and votes for the ticket. Otherwise, we will all die very soon.
My favorite game is without naming Donald Trump, name a good reason you‚Äôre confident about voting for Joe Biden.
The fact that Biden helped to draft the War on Drugs and 1994 Crime Bill causing millions of poor Black and Brown people to be imprisoned for non-violent drug crimes, STILL believes marijuana is a gateway drug and refuses to legalize marijuana is not propaganda.
When he decided to vote for Biden.
Haha, Joe Biden can‚Äôt string together a sentence so of course it would be better than his ad.
Memaw, I invited Trump &amp; Biden last night, so you and Jerry are more than welcome to head this way.
I‚Äôm glad President Obama never did anything like this.  VP Biden will not allow this when he becomes President.
Does it cost that much for Biden to virtually appear?  Wow.
Maybe Biden ate one
I will be voting Biden.  i will not vote 3rd party because the way the system is currently set up a 3rd party candidate can not win
Maybe joe Biden are one
Trump is trailing for lots of reasons, but a big one is because every time he opens his mouth something insane, false or idiotic comes out.   Biden does better the less he speaks. This isn‚Äôt a compliment, but...   MEN: look how far just shutting the fuck up can get you.
Biden will only turn America into Portland. Enjoy that
Was breaking in or I was being attacked. I wish there was a better option against trump but Biden‚Äôs what we‚Äôve got and I believe he is the best option for getting us out of this pandemic that trump has done little to help. I‚Äôm a nurse and I am tired of it and seeing our leader...
But Hunter Biden!
If Joe Biden wins, here are some of the top foreign-policy experts who could be tapped for senior and midlevel jobs in the administration.
It was you who did it. Just look at all the damage, look around you and see what you've done. Shame on you! Things will change in November. Biden 2020.Step  aside let the big boys handle things.
You dolts called Mitt Romney a Nazi while having Biden say he was gonna lock black people back in chains. I think you should look in the mirror to find who actually causes the civil discourse.
First 5 minutes of your CBS Nightly ‚ÄúNews‚Äù paid for by Joe Biden for President.
Because somebody, one of my chapter bruhs, said that Biden is using Bernie‚Äôs plan and that was incorrect.
It was Joe Biden at a press conference.
Still haven‚Äôt learned how to spot a bot yet, I take it? Y‚Äôall never were smart. The same posts are made on Biden‚Äôs page, ass hat.
I definitely see evidence of an 'enthusiasm gap' here. Trump's death cult will literally throw themselves into a funeral pyre for him. Biden supporters, not so much.
I don't know what makes you think Biden isn't pro police state.
#JoeBiden only needs to win 3 battleground states to defeat #Trump ‚Äì and he's leading in all 6 ...
Still more than Joe Biden can muster. Of course Joe won‚Äôt be the nominee anyway.
I'd imagine this the constant debate in the Biden camp. If you pick one of the well-known national stage Democrats, then you'll make it way easier to attack which is a problem when you're campaign strategy has basically just been Joe Biden being boring.
Trump, stuff it with another hamburghur. Biden has honor, years of service and integrity. You have a multibankrupt failure of a company, a failed presidency, a morally bankrupt soul. This country knows Biden. Now we unfortunately know you too. All too well. Go away.
Bull! Trump has done more for Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and women than Obama/Biden did in 8 years. That's a fact!  Democrats want to keep poor people poor, so they can control their lives by keeping them dependent on the Government! Government Dependcy = Less Freedom.
Gotta make sure Biden has the option of pardoning him if he gets elected.

Florida teen arrested in Twitter hack that hit Biden and Obama
Two party system and my favorite candidates, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, aren‚Äôt running any longer. A vote for an independent candidate is a vote for Trump at this point. Soooo it‚Äôs gonna be a Biden.
This is a nonsensical perspective in my opinion. Best choice for president. Biden commits to one term setting up VP to be the next president. Then doesn't choose who the best choice for president is. That logic doesn't follow...this isn't a race for VP but for 2024.
Assuming Biden sees the existentialist need to extend FDR's first 100 days to two years -- we are that far behind the eight-ball -- he'll must kill the filibuster to have predictable maneuvering room.  Schumer did well as a place holder, but he's not a wartime leader.
On my best day, can't give you Texas [although Biden may take the state], Kansas, unless Kobach wins primary, and one of GA -- and the other is tenuous. So . . . it's up to Schumer, an admitted institutionalist . . . except McConnell has controlled the US for 8 yrs by filibuster.
the world is laughing at you. Not up their sleeve or behind your back. To your face. Your landslide loss November 3 will be hysterical worldwide. Then the day after Biden is inaugurated, you will be irrelevant again. #Biden2020Landslide
If you‚Äôre a joe Biden supporter open this thread
Are Biden's promises any more reliable than Trump's? (Considering how extensively Biden has lied about his past.)
You‚Äôre delusional. Bernie supporters will not vote for you!  And Biden is not close to being as progressive as Bernie.
in my very own opinion, this is a really dumb take  if you think Biden is as bad as trump then I guess we will have to agree to disagree  splitting your vote to vote for someone who 99.99999% won‚Äôt win is pretty much a vote for trump, so have fun with that
Imagine being a Democrat and thinking that Joe Biden will beat Trump this fall. People are sick and tired of the political games. Fauci is a ding dong, pass it on!
Interesting! Will you be voting for Biden? I don‚Äôt know many republicans that have defected from the trump camp.
And if Biden drops in the polls she'll be blamed.
Biden is a transition candidate. He is trying to choose someone younger and that wants to POTUS. Susan Rice isn‚Äôt it. I think she would be a fine VP but Harris is the obvious choice.

Three months til the election. My dad is still a staunch republican but his support for trump is cracking due to the pandemic. If there‚Äôs the slightest chance I could get him to vote for Biden... is it worth trying?
What a difference a year can make! We saw this happen during Obama/ Biden Here it is again - reflections of societal values  Welcome #Boomers to a new "tweener" stage - too old for livable wage job, too young to benefit from their own monies paid into SocialSecurity #AmericaFirst
Your tweets are the funniest! Thanks Biden. Loved the laugh ü§£ today.

Biden can barely stay awake
No the point is: you cannot criticize Kamala for doing her job of enforcing laws that she didn‚Äôt create, without the required context that Biden authored the very law that enabled mandatory trivial prosecution of Black and brown folks.
Put another way, Rice brings to the campaign the full baggage of Benghazi, Russiagate, and doubles down on Obama-era foreign policy. And I tend to agree with  on  podcast, her lying really does matter. Idk if all that is worth the trouble for Biden
The thing about the Susan Rice chatter for Biden‚Äôs VP slot is this: Benghazi would certainly play into it, but people seem to forget the unmasking issues surrounding Trump. DJT would focus more on unmasking than Benghazi, bc one involves him and the other doesn‚Äôt.
I'm scared for the delusional people that believe Biden is any better and think we can all just go back to sleep if gets in office.
No one is gonna switch their vote from Biden to Ye. Chill.   Trump is done no matter who runs. Guys a goddamned disaster.
The difference is that Kamala is the frontrunner. They have to gun for her.   Also, if Biden didn‚Äôt author the 94 crime bill, Kamala wouldn‚Äôt have had that to enforce as a prosecutor.

Lmao u think Biden will win
So Joe Biden is running a campaign where he is offering virtually no answers or solutions from a selective group of reporters......then expects to debate President Trump live on stage about real American issues that the President has actually been fighting for?
I don‚Äôt maintain the DNC is good or bad I just know I don‚Äôt want Donald trump to be president so I will be voting for Biden  he wasn‚Äôt my first.... second.... or third choice but he‚Äôs the only one with a chance to win on the ballot in November and that‚Äôs my #1 goal

It‚Äôs not a stretch to see Biden as a Trojan horse for another candidate to get nominated when he drops out for medical and health reasons(VP choice). The DNC couldn‚Äôt get their preferred candidate thru actual voters so this is what they are doing.
I always wondered how someone like Joe Biden can become mega-rich on a meager government salary.  This is the reason.  We need a revolution.
You probably believe in Russian Collusion too ,that Obama and Biden didn't spy,  and they didn't plot a coup.
There's no evidence on Monica's blue v dress either.
Of course they will be humbled and silenced.  Look at Tara Reade about the Biden charges.  She's disappeared.  And let's not forget many on the left openly admitted they thought she was truthful and they said they'd support Biden, anyway.  Truth is nothing to the left, only POWER
Biden = Unity Trump = Division That's a winning strategy.  Repeat. Repeat. Repeat.  #biden2020 #Biden #Trump #Trump2020
I feel like I'm going to regret replying, but here goes. Many people who support BLM and defunding the police often only support Biden because he is not Trump. He will not make the substantive change we are looking for. The election will not end the movement.

Biden is a half eaten doughnut
A small group of us have been hearing #SusanRice as the top pick for Biden‚Äôs VP.  As time comes closer, for the announcement, the far right already have a target on her.
I‚Äôm old enough to remember when you called Joe Biden a racist because it was last year. Now you want to be his VP?
Attempting to cover-up Joe Biden's long history of racism and serial abuse is a bad look Adam.
I also like your "what we know" phrase - it's a common fake news phrase. It never has any back-up, it's just a very effective tool in mind control. It sets you up as being out of the norm if you don't believe what they are saying is true.
Who gives a crap, facts are facts, anything beyond that is needlepoint circle gossip.
Why would he tell CNN or any liberal MSM anything? They‚Äôd just help Biden cover it up.
Not a "story" it's backed up with documentation from Mar-a-Lago records and Palm Beach Police report.
Epstein was a member at Mar-a-Lago country club as is most of Palm Beach. These are just photos from country club member events.
The minute he found out about that, Trump called the Palm Beach Police Dept on Maxwell and Epstein as well as revoked their membership from Mar-a-Lago.
Additional federal aid is necessary to reopen schools and ensure economic recovery, former Vice President Joe Biden told teachers Thursday, slamming a COVID-19 relief bill proposed by Senate Republicans.
Look at this slinky sumbitch is over there dressed like a genie acting like he's sittin' pretty in Tetris city, refusing to negotiate about his Choose-Your-Adventure missile batteries. I can imagine you and Biden taking shots of Similac and tryin to put one of em together.
Barack Obama has spoken candidly about President Trump to party donors, bringing up the sexual assault allegations against Mr. Trump and warning of his efforts to push ‚Äúnativist, racist, sexist‚Äù fears.
One thing Trump has going for him is that his out-of-touch campaign consultants are quite a bit less out-of-touch than Biden‚Äôs.
Bet he'll resign once Biden drags his dumb ass through the ringer BIGLY after the first debate.
You really think Biden will be on the ballot in Nov.? Lmao
If you love child trafficking, vote for Joe creepy Biden.
You are 100% right! But only because you will never make it to your inauguration. Your senility will cause your disqualification. So, after Obama speech today, my money for Biden VP is either Susan Rice or Loretta Lynch. #obamaneverleft #obamaneveragain

Joe Biden floated having a Federal Prosecutor fired for investigating his son's business dealings in Ukraine. Oh guess what the prosecutor was fired and Biden gave $1B of tax payer money to Ukraine as an award.
So Biden didn‚Äôt do anything to hurt mfg during his 40 yr tenure? Just Trump in &lt;4 yrs while dealing with the an investigation day one essentially. All on the grounds of collusion with a foreign power from a dossier that was cooked up by the DNC, Clinton, Obama, &amp; Biden. Wake up
You're probably right! But I know Joe Biden didn't! I put my life on that! Barack Obama didn't and I put my life on that too! Anyone else there are up for grabs cuz I have no idea except for Trump we all know that he was there many times with many young girls
Trump fills arenas with cheering supporters and he can speak extemporaneously for an hour or more.   Biden can barely get 20 people in a high school gym, and does good to read off the teleprompter for 15 minutes.   Tell me how Biden has the support and momentum to beat Trump.
But Lobbyist and their money don't interfere  with how they vote üôÑ. This is what we will get with Biden administration,and am guessing  these are same ones who voted against Medicare for All and legalizing marijuana?
Too funny you can't even come up with your own sentence you have to use Trump's and alt right nationalist propaganda about Biden!  Trump is a racist! he's always been a racist he shows it every single day to Americans that he's a racist! Anyone who supports Trump is a racist!
Reason enough to vote for Biden
HA. You are going to lose bad,  Major blue wave coming. Biden will win in a landslide
The irony is... it‚Äôs the Democrats themselves, in Florida, complaining that Biden is oppressing the Hispanic vote! #LatinosForTrump #POC #VotingMatters

Whoever is running Biden's Twitter is doing a good job. But..he's our only option, so keep on keeping on.

Problem running against a really unpopular guy like Trump is that Dems don't wanna risk *anything* and let him sink himself. But there's so much to take a stand on. Biden needs to start trying to build movement *now*, not after Trump gets a whole campaign tossing shit in the air

That was the FBI predication to get the FISA warrant to listen in on Flynn..Was it Joe Biden the one who suggested using the Logan act?
This is such a load of horseshit from the same Republicans who are bringing you Project Lincoln.  Fuck off
Joe Biden has not said to not open schools. He has said to be guided by the scientific facts and recommendations, neither which our president heeds. He retweets what amounts to a witch doctor‚Äôs counsel. Biden will represent moms. Trump only represents himself.
he called Biden a traitor for suggesting --BACK IN APRIL --that Trump would suggest this very thing.
I find it absolutely amazing that anyone with half a brain would vote for Biden. Biden ever climbs out of his bunker and joins President Trump for a face off, game over for slow Joe.
We always knew we'd have to win without the Bernie Brats. So nothing has changed. And the polling is showing that Biden has what the voters want, and we're going to get it done. It's the Berners that are "oblivious." Better luck in 2024 or 2028 bros.
WE NEED EVERYONE TO GO AND VOTE. THIS HAS TO COME TO A END!!!!! BIDEN HAS ALOT A WORK TO DO WHEN HE GETS IN. WE HAVE TO GO AND VOTE!!!!!!
Biden winning will empower the rioters to go in for the kill.
Nope, you‚Äôll lose, then you won‚Äôt accept the results. The only thing I have to look forward to this year is replacing you with Biden, which we will. Please accept the results and leave.
Don't back up the election date, stay on course. Biden will fold.

If Biden and his successor get 8 year administrations each, it's probable that Obama will become the sole living former President at some point.
So I guess what we‚Äôre getting into then is the policy behind it.  The Obama administration never issued executive orders to separate families.  So I‚Äôd like the statement to be: Biden doesn‚Äôt separate families and hold kids in detention centers for 27 days where some of them die.

I‚Äôm not sure even an ‚ÄúOctober‚Äù surprise on Biden would work at this point. People saw how the email scandal messed up Clinton. Folks not falling for the okey doke this time. People are already proving less gullible to Trump theatrics this time around. He‚Äôs a sitting duck.
Nah. Once Biden is inaugurated, that‚Äôs it. The election will happen. He has no legal authority to stop it under the constitution.

Biden predicted it in April, Trump tweets it out in July...

Fun to go back and look at all the pundits that hammered Biden for suggesting such an outlandish thing back on 4/23: "Mark my words: I think he is going to try to kick back the election somehow; come up with some rationale why it can't be held."
Not that I am a fan of ‚Å¶ but we cannot allow a bunch of rich people with what they feel is a constitutional right to peddle their opinions for money and over other people‚Äôs opinions to yank the chain of the state. ‚Å¶
Trump, for the first time suggested delaying the election (and his impending colossal defeat) the power for which the constitution only grants to Congress, not the president. This man is a danger to democracy. He must go.

Yes indeed. I share your concern. Biden shows signs of cognitive compromise as well. Word finding issues, inappropriate comments, and more. Why did he even run? Angers me. We need a youthful Presidential nom. Dems suck!
Oh I totally agree with that, I think my problem is that I fail to see how Biden would be much different than Trump, based on his record. I'm voting Green this year

That is funny because all the Republicans I know are voting for Biden &amp; are too smart to fall for the lies of Trump &amp; his administration.  People do not like military force in American cities &amp; used on Ameicans. Using secret police is what dictators do.
Haha. I only meant that you're as likely to convince him to endorse Biden as you are to convince him to shave that thing.   Nevertheless I'm happy that you live in a better America now and can share your experience and wisdom.

I completely get what everyone is saying about Biden and I am not enamored by this candidate either but it the dems put up Mr. Hankey the Christmas Poo out of South Park against Trump, I would vote for him.

Fortunately, the Biden administration can stop it in its tracks.

That means Biden.
IMHO Buttigieg would be a good VP, but probably if Warren had been the nominee. But Biden should pick Warren. She may have some amount of baggage but she's sharp and can campaign well. Only thing about either of them is that they'd both be one-term. Biden/Warren is a 4 year tckt.
Yeah, many die hard Bernie bro‚Äôs hoping to let him live vicariously through Biden and inhabit his brain. Scary af.
No he will check their affiliation with the communist party and other in missions of evil. Joe Biden is nothing more than a southern Democrat and we know what that means what in the hell are people thinking
Don't think she's the right choice if you ask me. Too interested in getting it for the sake of it than because she wants to enact changes. The way she went after Biden early on left a bad taste in my mouth. It was showboating and needless. Stand out with a plan, not attacks.

Great article, although I somewhat disagree with your premise that Biden is a weak candidate. Strength is not an absolute, it‚Äôs relative, a point you concede. He‚Äôs gaffe prone, yes, but his heart is strong. That‚Äôs real strength.

If this were happening in South America, the US government would be strongly supporting violent revolution.  This ends in 1 of 3 ways... 1. Biden wins 2. Incredible violence erupts and many die, or 3. We fall into a fully authoritarian government.
If today‚Äôs platform decisions are any indication, Biden‚Äôs VP pick is way more likely to be Amy Klobuchar than Elizabeth Warren.
I think with Biden you‚Äôre only going to see more mental decline. He‚Äôs referred to himself as ‚ÄúJoe Biden‚Äôs husband‚Äù recently. It‚Äôs scary if elected a group of unelected people would run the nation. A moderate would be great but USA has stood firmly in their corners hard right/left

Let‚Äôs not get ahead of ourselves. This is the most important election in history.  And there‚Äôs only one candidate. Joe Biden. We can get back to issues and disagreements once we have saved the world from this nightmare.  We can plan November 4th on November 4th.

We'll give you Joe Biden as a gift of surrender. Then in the middle of the night Bernie will climb out of Biden's broken open body and fuck you up while you sleep-off the inevitable global drunken celebration following Trump losing 2020.  Fuck metaphors. That's the literal plan.
Oh god . . . a grassroots group of former Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders supporters who recognize Joe Biden's flaws but know that our nation will not survive four more years of Donald Trump.
Well you're wrong and your map is wrong. Florida not only is, has been, and is likely to remain fools gold for at least another cycle, but Pennsylvania not going blue for Joe freaking Biden is utterly preposterous. It's simply not gonna happen. There's no math to bear that out.
DEAR JOE BIDEN, Please choose Susan Rice to be your V P pick. She's wicked smart and is the most qualified. You know her from personal experience. She's got "the right stuff."
Biden war room? That's like saying "empty toilet".
Biden expected to choose running mate next week
This is THE smartest thing she could do. Clearly you missed something in Poli Sci; it's her race, not Biden's that she's running. Why endorse now? There's literally no reason for it. She can and should run her race in her district for her seat. Biden's got nothing to do with it.
She's right and she should say it. She has no reason to endorse him, and her race is about her, not about Biden. Smartest move she could make.
Biden that is.
I don't believe a word that comes out of Biden's mouth. It's all scripted and a known liar, which no one seems to give a shit about. The only thing maybe changing my mind is Trump sending secret police. That is just in fucking sane. Biden will not support a green deal, at all.
Vote for Biden if you want higher taxes, and all tax benefits Thrump gave to us little people taken away.
And Biden is a what?
I hope you are prepared for higher taxes and having all the tax breaks for us little people eliminated if Biden is elected.
You want a politician like Biden to be President so he can be controlled by the real power brokers and screw all of us.
OG Bernie is leaking out and it's nice to see. VERY different tone the last week or so, methinks Bernie is finally fed up and flexing his policy muscles. Biden MUST come Left or risk losing it ALL.
Honestly I‚Äôm just relieved some republicans are coming out against him. It will make it easier for other Republicans to turn the corner and vote for Biden.
Just please don‚Äôt vote for Biden
It's part of the platform and something every Dem would work toward. Bernie supporters want his exact verbage, some sort of tribute to his genius. He didn't invent M4A, won't champion it or push it through. Bernie lost, Biden is the nominee. Biden is plenty progressive. Bye.
Bitching about something that Biden and every other Dem wants and will work for because they don't adopt the exact Bernie phrasing and offer credit and tribute to him in the process is counterproductive. Bernie didn't invent M4A, he won't be it's champion, he LOST. GTFO.
One reason Democrats can't avoid talking about religion: people are really interested in it
Hey media commies: quit calling him a conservative!!!!
Biden emphasizes Trump's mishandling of COVID-19 in new ad campaign targeting older voters. GOOD! #Biden2020 #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #TrumpVirusKills145K
Yeah. Biden. Lol. You need your own cognitive test before you tweet again.
Biden has a voter..
I know, I think I have resolved to vote for Biden, but I will do anything in my power the next four years to get shit done. We really need to create a movement no one can fuck with. We need to start with down-ballot candidate now.
I agree, she would be selected by  because she is extremely qualified but I hear too many commentators focusing on selecting a ‚Äúwoman of color‚Äù as if that is the primary qualifier. No, offense Joe Biden, but she was my first pick for president.
I SO agree, and he Might do it to get brownie points (And Millions of Votes) that's why if Biden strikes the match first it doesn't matter as much what Trump Does!  I DOUBT the #OrangeLoser would pull the trigger then - because it was Biden's Idea (Bad, of course!)
I'm pivoting to diehard Biden supporter solely to make Cornelius Vermeule serve as minor dignitary in the most milquetoast liberal administration imaginable

One thing Biden needs to do Right Now is steal  the thunder out from under Trump by Committing to take Marijuana OFF the Schedule 1 List on Day 1.   This will create tens of thousands of jobs and Open Up legal banking for all these industries.
Explain this Chinese Joe Biden!!!!
Can you Imagine Basement Biden explaining the cognitive test..... Where's the Fucking popcorn for that!!!!!!!
Oh man. It's getting really Crazy. I hope we vote trump out and he leaves. There's a petition to sign to make sure he leaves saying that we the people will remove him if he don't Exit on Biden's Inaguration, Let the Military know we want stand 4 him not leaving.Trump reportedly hired her because she looked good on television.   - The first amendment explicitly prohibits mixing religion and government. This is one of the first things Biden and the new Dem House and Senate must restore. END THE RFRA.
That's right. If Biden gets elected, we can kiss our country goodbye.

On the Briefing you pointed out that Biden said rioters should be arrested &amp; tried. Yes, but he also said HE would not do it, but leave it to the police. But they won't! So he's just pretending. You have to read between his phony lines, ma'am. :)
If you support Biden stop coming on here to talk to us about it.
A former prosecutor won't work with Joe Biden's past when it comes to the criminal justice system. A lot of Black people are already locked up because of some of Joe Biden's terrible decisions, you add a former prosecutor who is responsible for locking up 1000s of Black people
I like a few progressives. Overall I am done with that party though...Joe Biden will not be getting my vote. We are being asked to abandon too many simple asks such as legalizing marijuana.

Im not voting for Trump or Biden so November 3rd is going to be a very entertaining day on this app for me and honestly I can‚Äôt wait.
Just remember that Trump has about 88 million Twitter followers and Biden has about 8 million.

Biden won't bring chaos. He won't stick around for even 2 days if inaugurated.  He has severe dementia and will simply hand over the reigns to the extreme liberal left. Then...the war would start!!
You're conflating Trump with Joe Biden. Democrats started the KKK, instituted Jim Crow laws, fought women's suffrage and the Civil rights movement. And BTW #IBelieveTaraReade
No, it's not in his best interest to pursue or respond to news stories. That will only give 45 more to work with. People and outlets are writing about Biden daily, he should only comment if something becomes huge enough to dominate all media cycles.

Chris Wallace is trying to cover his own ars. Biden did want to defund the police for political gain. Part of the Democrats strategic cover up, give the peoples what they want, allow cities to crumble and they will be running to you for your help and in return you get supporters.

JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.

I keep asking Biden supporters to give me one good reason not to vote for Trump. All they do is regurgitate the same tired drivel that has been spouted for the last 3 1/2 years. No one has yet made an argument I‚Äôm sincere in the fact that my mind can be changed on who I vote for.I mean Trump said something once a long time ago. Biden has a very clear ongoing repetitive issue here. These are not comparable.
If Biden is incompetent what is Trump? A baffoon?
She is the best candidate for Biden. I hope he realizes it.
I have always voted for the candidate, not the party. I liked John McCain. Then he pick Palin. I've seen videos of Biden and Obama. They got along well. I wish him someone like that, someone who suits him.  And yes, I will vote for him no matter who.
One would think that Fox News would support Conservatives because the alternative is going to be worse than the Obama/Biden eight year disaster.  If Biden wins and the Country becomes Socialist Communist will Fox New Anchors be willing to give up all they have achieved?

Makes voting for Biden even more justified if we are gonna see more movements away from brutal policing in exchange for more rehabilitative and compassionate measures.   It also seems I forgot that 154,000 people have died in less than 6 months in Trump‚Äôs USA. I feel very safe!
Yup.  I would agree.  #AmericaOrTrump , which is why I'm voting for Biden.

Maybe reporters will ask him if Biden's handlers ever allow them to ask questions.
The press kept this from being made public.  There was only a mere mention of him in the hospital.  You can bet if Biden comes down with it.  Not only would they report it.  But they along with the Demorats.  Will blame Trump for it.
That‚Äôs what they don‚Äôt understand, they think  it‚Äôs the masses that control the eland will elect Biden. They don‚Äôt know that trump just needs 270 votes in the electoral college to win a second term. We can‚Äôt wait to drink the tears of Democrats

He could stimulus check me a million dollars and I‚Äôm still voting Biden.
Yes!  Biden and Big Blue across the board.
Biden according to his past tells me he always make the wrong decision .
If the sane part of the country actually votes, it will not matter. Biden will have a mandate even the likes of Mitch McConnell could deny. Part of me thinks McConnell will be glad to see Trump go.

Know what is funny about the 2016 election? Joe Biden counted the EC votes in the Senate. Mrs. Clinton has been on her cry tour ever since.
They supported Bernie because they support socialism. Muslims do not like Jews. Today they said they have to lead their states for Biden but they do not have to endorse him. They are Marxist just like the BLM. America was founded to get away from that stuff. They want communism.
So true, looking forward to better days with Biden.
Arrogant and confident! Biden looks very weak! Just my opinion,  he better get sharp , because Trump is backed into a corner.
Because Biden looks and acts feeble! It won't be pretty!
Debates are gonna be ugly for Biden! Book that
I have no animosity toward Biden in this situation. He can‚Äôt help it. But the democrats are so unbelievably dishonest when they try to portray this guy as fit to be president. You have to be a fool to vote for this man!

Joe Biden was born Nov. 20, 1942. He would be 78 when he took office.  He would be 86 at the end of 2 terms.   This stuff is so dumb, you can't even make it up.   They needed to pick someone that was a reasonable age to run for president.  Common sense is not so common- Voltaire
Part of the reason Trump name calling Hillary in 2016 (Crooked Hillary/Nasty Woman) worked and name calling Biden in 2020 (Sleepy/Senile Joe) isn't working is because Hillary is a woman and Biden is a man. Remember, double standards are very alive in politics.

You do realize that the Trojan Horse had Greek soldiers inside? Pretty sure Biden isn‚Äôt packing soldiers inside his body.  Not a good analogy, insult, thought in general. Are you sure you passed that acuity test?
Ah yes, my inability to imagine that huge swath of voters who are (1) super concerned with Biden's cognitive state, but (2) become MORE anti-Biden AFTER he announces his VP. And also (3) haven't been accounted for by pollsters despite Biden's cog. being talked about from day 1.
Unless you have an argument for why the VP would turn people away from Biden or toward Trump, then the polls suggest his current floor. And I have a hard time imagining someone *already concerned* with his cog. state will move further *against* Biden based on VP. So, floor.
Absolutely disgraceful! Jill Biden should have stopped this madness. What an embarrassment! #VoteRedToSaveAmerica2020 #DemocratsAreANationalDisgrace
Honestly, you just seem to be looking for an excuse to repeat claims about Biden having dementia. If people are concerned about his cognitive state to the degree you suggest, then, again, it's hard to imagine any VP choice that does anything other than BOOST his numbers.
That article supports what Lisa pointed out, but I never disagreed with that. I disagreed with your point that the numbers are meritless until a VP is announced, because I don't see how any realistic VP choice worsens Biden's situation.
And give them to Biden? You really do like fiction, huh?
Or takes them from "voting Biden, despite 'dementia'" to not voting, voting 3rd party, or voting Trump? Because, again, otherwise, I don't see how the VP nomination affects this in any way other than *improving* Biden's numbers.
Do you have an argument that these polls are excluding the people like yourself who "know what dementia looks like"? If not, it seems like Biden's numbers will only get better, right? What VP choice do you see taking someone from "undecided, because 'dementia'" to "voting Trump"?
Joe Biden Says He's Not Available for Interviewsüò® #NoBullShit
I don‚Äôt think we should fall for rhe public polls again. People will say they support Biden in public but then vote Trump in private. We were sure Clinton would win. We need to fight harder than ever, especially in swing states.
Biden wont be elected, but go on believing he will
A Biden Bro tried to murder two people because they weren‚Äôt social distancing. I‚Äôll take ‚ÄúThings You Won‚Äôt See on CNN‚Äù for $400, Alex.
Because it shows your grasp of reality. Anyone who thinks Biden is controlled by communists or that all democrats are evil or stupidity like that I have no use for. Plain and simple.
I am super excited about Biden. No more racist walls. No more efforts to strip DACA recipients of their rights. No more presidential wars on a woman's right to choose, or my right to marry my partner, on cutting people's health care, or bashing our allies or citizens, etc. Go JB!
Settle for Biden!! But actually!!
So, it's Biden's fault that the MLB had to postpone games involving the Marlins and the Phillies? Brian Kilmeade has no business being in front of a camera, then, now, and in the future.

I know I've been in quarantine a while but I don't remember Biden being elected (yet). Isn't this country being run by the GOP and Trump's sympathizers?
Such a strange poll. No way in hell Biden has a bigger lead in NC than in Pennsylvania.
Minorities and women have done far better under Trump than at any other time in the Nation‚Äôs history. ... including eight years of Obama and Biden.  I have no doubt we‚Äôd see a lot of very young women in a Biden White House.
They aren‚Äôt use to Biden‚Äôs complete sentences and proper grammar, it probably scares them.
you can lead people to facts but you can‚Äôt make them learn. tens of articles about the dangerous narrative pushed in that stupid white coat video but yeah ur right they‚Äôre just pushing biden‚Äôs agenda, my bad

Biden leading in the polls? here are some unbiased polls we should pay attention too
By voting for Biden!
Hello VP Biden.  My Husband and I wanted to tell you this.  Make sure you have real time fact checkers during any debates with Donald Trump.  We think you need it for any and every debate with him.  P.S.  He's a proven liar.
Hey Suburban Voters, Joe Biden's Housing Policies Will Ruin Your Communities
Wake up American Patriots !!!! If Biden wins then this will be our normal future. Democrats apparently have gone so far left they endorse violence and destruction. Apparently they want another civil war in America.
You are a man voting Biden. so yeah you are on crazy pills
Oops. I wouldn‚Äôt put it past them that they did this on purpose so Biden could see reaction and then pick someone else when it blew up in his face. If he‚Äôs cogent that is.
Politico outs Joe Biden VP pick before Biden is Informed
Outstanding idea! Biden had 8 years as VP and zip.
Paula,  Why do you guys try to gang up on the President.  Do you all hate him that much?  If you by accident get Biden elected then this Country becomes a Socialist Communist Marxist Nation.  Is that what you really want?
Harris will be the actual Democrat nominee. Biden‚Äôs role is to be the hood ornament on the Presidential limo. If Biden even makes it through his inauguration, which is by no means assured, he will have the shortest Presidency since Old Tippecanoe. #25thAmendmentJoe
If this happens it‚Äôs game over Biden. I‚Äôve said this for long enough.
Joe Biden's running mate is Joe Biden.
Did you notice the setup questions for Biden and the difference the MSM makes in asking questions of Trump
Obama/Biden gate coming soon
obama/biden gate coming soon
What about Benghazi? What should we do with Clinton, Obama, and Biden over that?
Exactly that‚Äôs right. Biden knows he can‚Äôt debate POTUS
Watching Joe Biden
Still waiting to hear Joe Biden‚Äôs accomplishments that leader you to believe he will be our new lord and savior?
Why doesn't  take questions the same way  does? Allow a few preselected reporters to ask questions and have the answers scripted on the teleprompter. Do it that way until Biden changes his format. The MSM will demand it.
Watching Joe Biden free associate and not understanding a thing. I can only have my head explode so many times in one day. Bill Barr, then this. I cant
Trump will crush Biden. It won‚Äôt be close.
Thank goodness Biden didn't opt for "Brick by Brick" as a campaign slogan. (a bit of an inside UT Vols joke, there).
Val Demmings is the woman whom Biden should choose for a running mate. She is brilliant and dedicated. Give her some love, Joe!
Will President Biden get the same loyalty from the attorney general that trump is receiving, I think not
I'm not partial to #intimidation.  No #SniffyJoe.  Are You Sure 'Vote for Joe Biden or We'll Kill You' Is the Best Campaign Pitch?
Biden is 100% correct. Often when in public people say I look just like someone, ask if I‚Äôm from Vietnam, Korea, China, etc., or call me ‚Äúoriental‚Äù. People also have corrected me when I say where I‚Äôm from and say ‚Äúno, you‚Äôre Chinese‚Äù
Biden likes people he has worked with before.  You'll understand when you're a senior citizen.
‚ÄúHidin‚Äô Biden‚Äù is too unstable to campaign so he is thankful for using CV as an excuse to not campaign.  Trump is feeling too confident...there are no guarantees.  Very interesting times.....
By the way, Neil Gorsuch &amp; Brett Kavanaugh should be impeached and removed under #Biden, for refusing to hear 2nd Amendment cases because they knew the numbers were not in their favor. #SCOTUS #2ndAmendment

That's how they get her in. Biden is the Trojan horse.
No, the switch will be AFTER the election, maybe even before he's sworn in. Biden won the primaries because the rest of the field were too far left for many Democrat voters. They need to keep him at the top of the ticket for precisely that reason.
Vice President Kamala Harris will pull the 25th Amendment ploy on Biden, and it will work ‚Äî who will deny that Biden can't handle the job? Biden's will be the shortest Presidency since that of Old Tippecanoe. In fact, maybe we should start calling him that. #OldTippecanoe
One way for Biden to try and save face.
Just like if biden wins the virus will no longer be news. Just hold your water until then. If I'm wrong by all means tweet me then.
Really, does he even know who Biden is?
You get more Trump because law abiding citizens such as us become the silent majority we are. Biden is toast
Here some hard truth for you. Trump will defeat Biden. I realize you may not want to accept it, but it is reality.
Propaganda doesn‚Äôt win and I hate to tell you Biden isn‚Äôt going to win.
Hillary Clinton and dementia Joe Biden without adopting any progressive platforms lmao good luck
Joe Biden will never debate President Trump live on a stage.
Biden will not let any one ask him a question
So why do we care if she doesn‚Äôt endorse? Plenty of others with much stronger voices have. If we‚Äôre lucky, Biden will win without it. And if we aren‚Äôt, she will endure 4 more years of a president who hates everything about her and wishes her harm. Her bed to lie in so to speak.
If these several vaccines are getting approved in October as mentioned then  and his hope that the virus pandemic will take down  dies. That‚Äôs the only thing Biden can run on. Everything else Trump obliterates The Sleepy One on.
There's a rumor going around that Joe Biden got dressed all by himself this morning. Can anybody verify this?
Anyone on the left that wants Biden as president is loving every damn bit of this shit with the china virus numbers the media feeds you and the riots and the pointless masks. Ppl are sick of hearing about it
You are correct. Biden will not debate Trump at all.
BAHAHAHHA AND WHY NOT BIDEN'S
And as everyone with half a brain has predicted, biden will get out of debating my president...and can even say "I didn't say no, Notre Dame did"... it cannot happen online, Joe Biden will have the questions and answers in his lap the whole time
Orgs like this and  should not use the GOP and Republican name.   Supporting a man who defaces the Republican values is a slap in the face for the whole party.   Don‚Äôt like Trump? Fine. Support a write-in or literally anyone but Joe Biden
If I was handeling Biden‚Äôs campaign I would cancel the debate(blame it on the virus) if I had a 10 point lead I would let Trump keep doing all the talking he just keeps doing damage
The same polls that said Hillary was gonna win.. if Joe Biden held a rally now he'd be lucky if 30 ppl showed up
Show me where there's any enthusiasm for Joe Biden besides the Twitter bots
Wow this weekd 59 shot 12 dead. 25 more shot on Monday. You still riding the Obama train to make sure gang members have guns to kill each other, thinking crime has to go down.Well it didn‚Äôt work the 8 yrs Obama/Biden was in.Your ignorant for not asking for help.
What's your favorite Biden policy?
If every Democrat in the country votes for Biden in Nov. we will win the election. We need every Democratic voter to get that ugly motherfucker out of the White House.
can‚Äôt believe joe biden is gonna be the next president wtf
Trump is winning in a landslide. Biden doesn't even know he's alive
Or h1n1 that infected 60 million.  I'm sure you locked down then as well..  answer to that was stop testing.. Obama and biden didnt have a clue. What did science say about that? Ahh. Nothing as it went away because the media didn't continue to cover it, occured after election.
If anyone can, it's Joe Biden

My guess is he's a MAGAt. Why else would he try and distract and post a negative about Biden? They try to be slick, but they're anything but.  Bunch of fucking sell outs.
Joe Biden wasn't sending unmarked federal agents into American cities to attack peaceful protesters. TODAY we have GESTAPO like actions being taken by a "president" who has shown that he has no regard for this country OR her people. INCLUDING our troops, the most precious of all
Blatant, made up false statements about what Joe Biden was doing 10 years ago doesn't have anything to do with it either, but you had no problem injecting your bullshit into the conversation. I just responded with some TRUTH. I noticed you STILL haven't addressed it.
I'm voting Biden but begrudgingly.That's what I keep talking to people about,how opinions &amp; most talking points are unproductive &amp; action regarding justice vs injustice is what matters. i.e.stopping &amp; being ready to record if someone sees a black person pulled over,protests...
&amp; my "racist,sexist" comments are just fact based, i.e.  commenting "Biden is what we got another white,old man with slight xenophobia..but better than a man without a soul like 45."I am still not sure if the guy who called me a racist,sexist,ageist is an adult..so hard to tell
Biden wasn't in office when Putin was paying bounties to the Taliban to slaughter US Troops. TRUMP STILL HASN'T CONFRONTED him over it. Troops are STILL being targeted. And Trumps' GESTAPO thugs attacking US citizens is OK? Trump is a TRAITOR &amp; so are YOU
I'm not being mean, but please understand, if you are even thinking of voting "left" ( and I don't care if it's Biden, Sanders, anybody with the Democratic Party) you will regret what they'll do to this country, it may not be the very day you vote, but it won't be long after...
Tell her she needs to do better since her prick son says shit that would get his ass beat if he said it in person.Or even worse make someone vote for Bernie &amp; get trump reelected.Your entitled obnoxiousness really will make people not vote Biden so keep it up if that's your goal.
I‚Äôd point to the Joe Biden for President sign in my front yard and close the door.
Insult #6 good work...Biden campaign should be proud. Maybe you are really protrump with a probiden account, trying to sabotage Biden, that makes the most sense.
If you don't point out the problems within a society they won't get fixed.I pointed out obvious problems.If you can't see that,perhaps you are part of the problem.Quite honestly,maybe avoid commenting on twitter to strangers because you are not making Biden supporters look good.
You are making a lot of promises that you will not be able to follow through on since it is so obvious that you not going to be re-elected. GO BIDEN!
You can beat Biden off?
Joe biden doesn‚Äôt even remember beans
You are either a 12 year old or a bot. At least Biden has bots too...that's encouraging I guess.
Thanks. I don't buy Nike or Apple.  And why do you claim I have "marxist racist" values... that doesn't even make sense. Also, why are you saying the Biden is responsible for things his adult son does? If he has unethical financial interests in something, as you imply.
So I think it's official Biden supporters are xenophobic, status quo assholes too...but damn it, I still got to vote for him. #Biden2020
Aww you are so right...it is not your fault I am a weak,illiterate,fragile woman, woe is me.  Seriously though, reverse racism does not exist. In history mostly white men have been the oppressors, the fact that I need to explain this to a Biden supporter is very disturbing.
Internal polling is basically Trump saying "People say". Its going to be so funny to see Trump on 1/20/21 sitting out the Biden inauguration in Trump tower and protesters singing, Nananana hey hey hey goodbye, lol.
the leadership of the Democratic Party is extremely old (pelosi, schumer, biden, clyburn, hoyer, durbin, etc.) and its targeted base is made up of two demographics that are also on their way out (baby boomers and suburbanites)

I don't want to be too blunt, but you need to hear this:  Biden MUST  pick a Black female VP.  At this point, it would be insulting not to. There are so many highly qualified Black women. This national conversation about racial justice is THE conversation. Get on board.
New man, woman, in Whitehouse. Biden 2020. I got extra points
Biden has publicly addressed this and admitted that he has violated boundaries. He has promised to become more aware of this and change his behavior. Trump, on the other hand, has said inappropriate things about his daughter since she was an infant with no awareness.
BLM is a communist movement. The money that is raised doesn't even go to black lives or communities. It goes to fund Biden's campaign. I don't want to hear it until you guys actually step in to save ALL BLACK LIVES. Do something about the majority of death in their community.
This would so totally be me if I had the pleasure of meeting Vice President Biden-Soon to be President Biden!
Biden isn‚Äôt going to win and anyone thinking that believes the hype way to much. It will be Trump. Silent majority is real
It‚Äôs not a done deal. We need to make sure Biden wins.
This is what is the most important to point out? What about Hunter Biden made billions from conflict of interest contracts with our allies. We paid for all his trips &amp; secret service. Biden put a US island next to Epstein‚Äôs in his Bros name to transport kids &amp;celebs.#pedogate2020
Joe being a pedophile with children in his basement doesn‚Äôt? Your sick. Hunter Biden made billions off of govt contracts &amp; we paid for his trips &amp; secret service. Biden‚Äôs secretly put his bro‚Äôs name on a us island next to Epstein‚Äôs to transport children &amp; celebs. The truth coming
How many billions of $$ did Hunter Biden make off of us when Joe gave his co. contracts which should have been a conflict interest. Joes bro‚Äôs island next to Epstein‚Äôs formerly owned by US was given to him by Obama/Joe to transp children after Trump talked to the victims lawyers.

I'm hoping that every state is a swing state in November.  I really want Biden to take Tennessee.  Remember: Voting is the ultimate protest.

The closer we get to Nov 3 and the further Trump drops in the polls, the more desperate his minions will become and the further they will reach with their scare tactics.   People want to return to some level of normalcy and in Joe Biden they can see that.

Black voters were vital to the South Carolina primary victory that set former Vice President Joe Biden on the path to the Democratic presidential nomination, but recent polls suggest he is at risk of failing to mobilize the voters in the general election

I'm sorry, but I can't feel a bit sorry for Kickback Biden.  He been in government all these years and all he has accomplished is to steal us blind.A presidential debate is a conversation. It does not require a live audience. If the Biden campaign dodges debates in the name of safety, how will a President Biden ever safely meet with staff, congressional leaders or anyone? How will he govern without meetings &amp; conversations?

Antifa might sink the Biden campaign.
Folks, don't forget this: the Biden campaign *is* lockdown. There is no campaign beyond that. So when you see schools staying closed here while reopening in every other country in the world, understand what is happening.
If Trump pulls off a win in November, expect the media hysteria over the pandemic to continue and, perhaps, even translate into a newfound fear of seasonal flu. Fear will be their perpetual goal. If Biden wins, different story.

Roll the Tape: Biden Supported ‚ÄúDefunding the¬†Police‚Äù
Biden supports a social engineering scheme called Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing. A federal takeover of local zoning laws would force suburban towns with single family homes to build high-density affordable housing to allow low-income minorities to choose suburban living.

Biden does not stand a snowballs chance in the fall...
I think that even if the GOP loses the Senate, the filibuster will remain.  Biden was a Senator for decades, so he knows how useful it is.  Plus, as a Senator for decades, he also knows that nuking the filibuster could eventually pave the way for the GOP to push in their agenda.

nah we‚Äôll have a vaccine a few days after Biden is elected. Spring sports aren‚Äôt in danger
And Biden was his #2.
I'd love for Kamala to be part of Biden's admin, but I think she's better than just VP.  VP doesn't really do much, normally.  Also, if naming someone else VP helps carry a state that's close, that could help put Biden in.  I think California is in the bag.
If you think Joe Biden is "far left," you are certifiably insane.  Lay off the Red Bulls and Caps Lock key.
On January 20th, 2021, Trump's term ends. He will have zero power to do anything. If he refuses to leave, the military will escort him out immediately under Biden's order. I think it is more likely he flees the country because of the avalanche of lawsuits piling up against him.
But it IS tRump's America. How can anyone blame Biden, who hasn't taken office (YET!), on people protesting tRump and his insane policies?
Biden is a joke

Biden has barely registered as a blip on the political radar screen. Suddenly, ALL MSM &amp; polls are hailing him as a Covid expert, America-saving, Consoler-in-Chief, God! All I see is an old, masked, basement dwelling dolt! Dems trying to make a silk purse out of a sow‚Äôs ear?
Clinton and Biden
Would be the best case scenario. Trump is a Manchurian Candidate (when he accuses Biden of being a Manchurian Candidate, that means he himself is one- it‚Äôs his biggest tell- accuse others of what you‚Äôre very guilty of doing)
I‚Äôm hearing that Joe Biden is ‚Äúbetter equipped‚Äù to handle the Corona virus. Is that based on his stellar performance as VP, his historical accomplishments over 40+ years, a Covid Command Center in his basement, or because Cornpop is his secret weapon?
He's back: Trump gains on Biden to near tie in new Rasmussen poll
The Biden campaign: disease, depression, and racial discord
I woud never vote for Biden ! Trump all yhe way üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
Could Biden pass?  That‚Äôs why he don‚Äôt take test.
This man is a complete buffoon!   Joe Biden: 'People' don't distinguish between Chinese and other Asians  via
If Biden and Obama can sit in the same room, then Trump and Biden can debate
I got news for obama he's not running for president well has biden in his lap as a puppet not interested in his thoughts or opinions so glad I don't have to hear that voice anymore what a narcissistic person!
uh . that's a Democrat ran city there idiot and Trumps America has been ran by Biden , Schumer , Pelosi and others that's been in office for 30 and 40 years ... Trumps America had the lowest unemployment rate for every race , gender and creed until  the Democrats China Virus üòÇFO
It‚Äôs impressive  that Biden is  so damn original that he bats the ‚ÄúRacist‚Äù word around with confidence...like he coined it. Sorry Joe, that word is as pass√© &amp; worn-out as you!
How cute! Social distancing, and masks.  Does Obama control Biden‚Äôs strong?
Obama to Biden ‚ÄúYou are going to be able to bring together people &amp; reassemble a nation‚Äù Biden calls Trump ‚Äúa racist‚Äù
The 26 ppl that heard Biden say that gave a collective eye roll. üëÄüëÄüëÄ
The trump virus is needlessly killing Americans. We must have relief! Vote for Joe Biden November 3rd! (and all Democrats)                                        #wtpBlue
I Can‚Äôt believe that average American Dems would EVER vote for Biden‚Äôs anti-American, Socialist platform!  American Dems will beat themselves up either way... as some have with Dem state leaders....so let it be because you ‚Äúheld your nose‚Äù &amp; voted Trump! No one will know!
The GOP will be totally aghast at this until VP Biden is sworn into office then their collective panties will be in a wad ‚Äúneeding‚Äù to curb Presidential overreach
We the people have to vote for Joe Biden in such huge numbers to overcompensate for voter suppression, lost mail in ballots, long lines, too few voter machines and rigged voter machines and our votes just being thrown away!  Our Democracy depends on US!I have seen a video of Biden in 1993 spewing racist nope
Freedom to speak just look at Biden's racist comments in 1993 and Kanye West Jesus saves and it is prophetic
Wow, dems have nothing. Sure are some real winners on Biden's short list üëá
When do you stop repeating this lie?  Obama/Biden created more new jobs PRE-COVID than  did  Primary Source:    Obama's Last 38 Months 8,069,333 Trump's First 38 6,556,214  Obama's Last 42? 8,070,099 Trump's First 42? -7,640,000 (MINUS)
you call kanye a puppet when biden is totally senile - incapable of his own thought - and trump bows to whatever pressure comes on him and is too weak to get anything done
Is Biden a better fit of your values?

Only 59 more days for the Biden camp to find a way to NOT debate Our President Trump!!!...
You can vote for Joe Biden, be anti Trump, and not support the Democratic platform. Those things are all mutually exclusive. Biden will be a 1 term President, but we need 4 years to heal. Just because you despise the corrupt racist in chief doesn't mean you aren't conservative
I would be shocked if you have that many listeners. The truth is that joe has so many listeners because his podcast is good. He's not an out of touch ex actor who makes excuses for Biden's sexual assaults.
There are so many people degrading  right now, you've got to figure she's the odds-on favorite for Biden's vice-president.  Fine by me.
I hear not even the Dems in the House &amp; Senate are voting for you &amp; #Biden
When Biden is in his basement does he know where he is?
The Extreme Leftist Terriorists think nothing of lying about anything, even a man's dealth.......yes, it is sad. If for some unGodly reason reason Biden should be elected;...then wer as a nation are in Trouble!!!
We ALREADY HAVE that President Mr. Biden!....
Front 2...they‚Äôre coming for your income. Although the authors state that they‚Äôre not saying MDs make too much, the tweets of several of the authors suggest otherwise. Several of them advised the Obama admin and will likely advise a Biden admin. Doctors better wake up and fight.
You will be removed in January when you lose to Biden in November or if the election is delayed. Only martial law can stop the unseating of a president &amp; guess what it hasn't happened so you getting out one way or the other. #youidiot
Only 59 more days for the Biden camp to find a way NOT to debate Our President Trump!!!....
The look on her face illustrates the excitement the Democratic Party feels concerning their chances of winning with Biden............
No...The election date is set and folks are preparing to go to the polls. Trump is just afraid of the very public butt kicking Joe Biden is going to give him.
And Biden speaks coherently?????
Susan Rice, what you showed in the Benghazi massacre shows how you work under pressure. You want to be VP. Susan Rice or not everyone will lose if Joe Biden wins in 2020. Mostly our country. Vote Donald Trump 20/20 to save our country.  üá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤
if Susan Rice gets in as VP for Biden she will eliminate him some way or another same with Kamala Harris they will become the president because Biden won't be able to pull through bad choice all together
You are ok with what Biden.  Obama and Hillary did ???
If we do not elect Biden by clear and concise numbers we may have trouble getting trump out of office. I don‚Äôt believe our democracy will survive 4 more yrs of trump. I am going to take picture of my ballot in case I need it later. #VoteTrumpOut2020
So IMO did Barr prove in the hearing yesterday that he is dt's lackey?  Did the republicans in that hearing seem to think that was ok? I think so. We must vote in numbers even greater than mid-terms. We must put Biden in office by a landslide.
kim it's not ok. Biden will never debate Trump.
This is the most blatantly corrupt in American history. I'm 66, and I've paid attention to politics since the late '60s. Every damn day is another "you've got to be shitting me!" scandal. They're shameless. After his defeat in November, they'll go crazy 'til Biden's inauguration.
Elizabeth Warren is the last woman of color Joe Biden can choose for his vice president. Pocahontas. Pocahontas. Pocahontas.
Only 61 Days Left for the Biden camp to find a reason NOT to debate Our President Trump!!!...
What one policy does Joe have to create jobs? After all, he &amp; Barack SuckBama are responsible for many jobs leaving our Country for elsewhere. Remember BO asking about a magic wand? Biden was part of our prev demise. Why the hell would anyone slightly intelligent want 2 go back?
I want to see the day when a DemocRAT can tell the truth without hypocrisy!  I‚Äôll bet you were all about hearing the baseless claims against Kavanaugh, but totally ignored the lady who accused Blithering Biden with proof!

Omg even fox news is in the bag biden.biden calls certen people to ask questions and then looks at notes to answer the pre determined question and fox shows this bull.God help us a biden win will be it folks stick fork in
Only 62 Days Left for the Biden camp to find a reason NOT to debate Our President Trump!!!...
Biden knows the questions.
Biden is lying about President Trump. Obama was one of the most racist presidents. Obama caused all this hatred towards police officers and caused the division in this country. Obama did nothing to improve the lives of minorities and he kept them in bondage to the government
Again Biden and Democratic Party lie about President Trump. He is the only President that has improved the life and job status of all minorities. He is the only President that has not done identity politics and does not pander to any one group. He has improved all lives
This is another example that Biden is inept and mentally incompetent. He needs to be removed from the election.
Yes, very unfortunate.  is clearly terrified of Don Jr.‚Äôs cutting-edge political commentary like ‚ÄúJoe Biden is a racist for supporting crime bills‚Äù and ‚ÄúDid you know that Democrats once owned slaves?‚Äù
I'm more concerned about independents and people who voted for Trump last time, getting those people to vote for Biden. Plenty of other choices who don't carry that devisive baggage.
156 Americans shot over this past weekend in New York and Chicago alone. And people there still want their Democratic Mayors and governors and possibly Joe Biden. What a joke. Save America vote for Trump in 2020. üá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤
We will get to hear all about Benghazi again if it‚Äôs Rice. Seems like a major negative for her as a choice.   I would strongly prefer someone who had at least been elected to some office at some point in their life.   No choice for VP will keep me from voting for Biden, however.
We all know that President Trump works 24/7 towards making our country great. And we all know Joe Biden can't work 7/24. Democrats are smart keep your ass in the basement Jojo. Think America is unsafe today. Then elect Joe Biden. We all in this country will be f*****. KAG 2020.
How in the world could anyone vote for Biden, do they want our country destroyed..
Only 63 Days left for the Biden camp to find a way NOT to debate Our President Trump!!!!!....
Of course, Gotta keep Biden in the basement!
This will be the democrat strategy for ducking out of the debates. They will never allow Trump to embarrass Biden...which everyone knows is what would happen.
The lack of enthusiasm will hurt Biden.
SO freaking SICK of revelations that should be, and could EASILY be followed to prosecution. AND NOTHING. Gates, Epstein, Maxwell, Clinton, Comey, Brennen, McCabe, Strozk, Biden, Obama, etc., etc., etc. ü§¨ I tell you what, just get back when there‚Äôs an indictment.
So just to round this up, the current Republican platform is to increase the debt burden for students, end unemployment benefits for people who lost their job during a pandemic, and, uh, call Joe Biden racist for dumb quotes from the 1970s? Sounds like a winning formula.
Obama-Biden operatives had 'shocking' financial ties to Russia: Author

We're going to enjoy seeing all of that bullshit coming down 177 days, 15 hours, and 41 minutes from now.   Joe Biden's inauguration is going to be celebrated like a national holiday.
Mr. President,...the Mob Media, Biden, Pelosi, and Schumer were so wanting you to do that pitch. They would have dragged you through the mud a whole week about that. Now they have to go back to the "Basement" and regroup!! Way To Go Sir!!!!!!...................
I can think of precisely zero reasons why Biden would do an interview on Fox. There are no persuadable voters who still watch Fox. There is no benefit.
Biden  Is this accurate? America is waiting for your answer.
They apparently said that they wanted to show what Biden's America would be like forcing people to wear masks and such.....while currently in Trump's America...where they're forced to wear masks and such...ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I don't think their IQ even registers on a scale
Joe Biden, if elected, will do exactly what he is told to do. He‚Äôs no leader ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I never understood this sentiment. This itself is racist to assume that people would only vote for Biden because he‚Äôs democrat or Kanye because he‚Äôs a Hip-Hop artist....only proving what Kanye said earlier
To promote equality in the form of violence is against all that America stands for...combined with a Presidential Candidate who can‚Äôt even remember his words to finish a sentence?? I can‚Äôt even believe the Democratic Party hasn‚Äôt pulled Biden yet. God please take over. üá∫üá∏üôè

Biden is actually extremely coherent, but he‚Äôs just kept on tranqs and etc so he doesn‚Äôt rant about immigrants and say the n word
Is this what you want AMERICA?...A vote for Biden will get you this!.............Our President Trump is our last Hope for AMERICA!!!!. Make America Great Again, Please!!!

I don't believe your Polls at all. How can Joe Biden be leading when he can't even put a sentence together that is coherent??? He makes absolutely no sense at all when he speaks.
So Crazy Sean, you just keep supporting #45. He‚Äôs going to do ALL of those things, isn‚Äôt he? Use your head, man. It is a binary choice now. You wait her stand with America and Biden or you stand with trump.
Do you want a president that will grab his ankles to China like him and his boss did for 8 years then vote for JoeBiden. If you want a president that will stand up to China and Iran then vote for DonaldTrump. Joe Biden will destroy everything Trump has built even a great economy.
Boris Epshteyn:"In Joe Biden's America, even Mother Nature will hate the United States government." Narrator: Donald Trump is the current head of the United States government.
I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs fault!
Even if trump refuses to leave the WH even if he files court docs, the constitution is clear, on Jan 20 he ceases to be the president unless he is re-elected.  Biden will be sworn in and as commander in chief can require military assistance to remove the squatter trump.
No way in hell Joe Biden can run this country. He doesn't have the since nor the stamina. The Nancy Pelosi,s and Chuck Schumer,s oh yeah can't leave out AOC.

Does Trump realize all our troops that are not home do Mail in ballets? This man is not right!!! He‚Äôs just not!! I live in Memphis Tenn. in the SOUTH &amp; a Democrat! Alot of the South are REPUBLICANS I WAS until Barack Obama &amp; from then on DEMOCRATE. You have to win Mr. Joe Biden!
If Biden now has all the answers on how to ‚Äúfix‚Äù America, why didn‚Äôt he (as VP) share them with Obama during the Great Recession that drug on for 8 years?? Also, where are all of his legislative successes in a 36 year Senate career (other than enriching his family)??
I agree - they‚Äôre all evil - we‚Äôll lose this country if Biden wins - he‚Äôll be a puppet head AOC + 3 will run the show
What if Biden doesn‚Äôt acccept the lose, like Gore?
Oh yeah. Biden‚Äôs got this. He can just coast home.
I still think it will be Hillary/Harris but they sure are dragging Biden along...
Biden winning is the only damn thing that matters now and we should take all the help we can get. This is war.
Some people do not need to bring up such pettiness. Do we need a dictator (Trump ) or do we need a person that is compassionate &amp; WON‚ÄôT let our Unite States be destroyed like it is being done today! Yes we need JOE BIDEN to run our country ( AMERICAN ) !!!
AMEN AMEN!!!  We need someone named Joe Biden!!
The man to do so is in the office, but these chicken shit governors are so scared of offending people when laws are being broken and lives threatened. Please tell me Kent you don‚Äôt think Biden is the answer?
does  know you want to beat Biden off?
Joe sniffing hair publicly makes the claims against him much more credible. He's openly pedophillic and perverted, Trump is not. Biden's actions make claims against him much more credible.
Biden's 77, what's your point?
No, that's Biden. He's the one that sniffs small girls on the regular, has much more credible accusations against him, and says plenty of racist things (like if you don't for for him "you ain't Black" or "poor kids can be just as bright and just as talented as White kids").

should have known some bullshit like this would come out when our revolution, progressive democrats of america, and roots action gave biden the thumbs-up to pick her (along with two other white women) as his VP.
2020‚Äôs next twist: Trump replaces Pence with Elizabeth Warren, Biden names Tucker Carlson his running mate, and NOBODY in the country knows how the &amp;%#! they‚Äôll vote.
At least Biden won‚Äôt make fun of it or act like it‚Äôs about to disappear. It‚Äôs going to be hard for anyone to just turn it around at this point because we have no leaders!
biden &amp; bernie &amp; bloomberg shouldn't have run in 2020.
I can‚Äôt believe some are suggesting having two white 70 somethings on the ticket. That‚Äôs tone deaf AF. Kamala should be Biden‚Äôs VP.

Fox News, reporting that Trump will push back the election.
Just curious but what did Biden bring to the table in 2008? He was another senator from a blue state. No geographic, background or electoral diversity added by his selection.
Schumer the most corrupt person in the Senate bar none. He‚Äôs right on par with Biden and has a braid smaller than a catfish. Probably smells just as bad too.

Joe Biden narrows down his VP list, with Karen Bass emerging as one of several key contenders
Because for the vast majority of us--as opposed to those with the repetitive comments and questions posed on Twitter--Joe Biden could choose a floss pick tossed out in a parking lot and we'd be good with it. We see the mental masturbation and hand wringing as a waste of energy.
Ok. But we knew trump couldn't do any of that from jump üòÇ. So where does that leave us? At least Biden was a PART of a successful presidency

Joe Biden Makes The Simplest Anti-Trump Promise Ever And People Are Here For It
Christian here. Biden is the man! He may not be anti abortion, but he cares for babies at the border, old people, our safety from the virus, and restoring the economy! He has plans for a future other than gloom &amp; doom! I do not worship the ‚Äúbeast‚Äù in the Oval Office.

This why parents and their kids have a problem, this the exact shit that come out of older adults mouth. If y‚Äôall can‚Äôt respect my vote than, I‚Äôm not voting for the people you respect because they obviously don‚Äôt respect the millennial vote to. Cough Cough Joe Biden.
Quick reminder. We know you are a traitor. Biden will rectify that in January. Have you ever been to Terre Haute? I hear it is nice this time of year.
Biden will pardon his. There are no good guys left.
Final two are completely absurd. The nation will still be divided and Biden‚Äôs family is comically corrupt. This whole tweet exemplifies the danger of a Biden presidency‚Äîelecting him will do nothing to alleviate the conditions that gave us Trump, but people will pretend otherwise!

That went out the window with Tara Reid. Credible evidence against Biden &amp; #metoo¬† died.  Hypocrites!
Plus, EVERY. SINGLE. DEMOCRAT. HAS SAID THAT CLINTON NEEDS TO GO TP JAIL IF GUILTY!  Meanwhile, all Trumptards do is whine about bias and say that people have TDS.  I guess they forgot about their Stage 5 freak out over EVERYTHING Obama did for 8 years.   Talk about Triggered!
Me too! Biden, Kerry &amp; Mittens Romney are corrupt to the core!! What are they so afraid of?
But he didn‚Äôt answer why Dead People only vote Democrat. Or if you vote for Biden, you‚Äôre a pedophile.
A 3rd party vote isn't a vote for Trump or Biden.  A 3rd party voter wasn't going to vote for either of those 2 anyway.

Are you teaching people how to break,  ignore,  and skirt the rule of law?   I'm guessing you can use recent personal experience and testimony to give great examples of how you allowed Hillary to do it and how you, your team,  Obama and Biden excelled at it...

Joe Biden would still be Uncle Joe if he wasn't running for President now everybody hate him, ion understand üò´
Possibly the only hope of normality here is if a critical mass within the GOP decides not to take Trump seriously if Biden wins and he refuses to concede. If they won‚Äôt fight his civil war with him, I doubt he can create a groundswell on his own.
Well that and Biden doesn't even tweet. The one Trump account is definitely him
Honestly kinda hope President Trump wins just so we can all scream ‚Äúrigged!‚Äù &amp; ask him how come it was ‚Äúrigged‚Äù if Biden would win but fair if he wins. Can‚Äôt wait.

Get a clue #Hydroxychloroquine has been around 65 years and it‚Äôs saving lives . Biden is probably taking it right now . You should research. Politics kills
The conversation about Trump not leaving office after losing the election is stupid. I mean dumb as hell. If it's that difficult to figure out what to do, this country is a dayum illusion. If his own party doesn't go in and escort him out, Biden can get crew together to do it.
He‚Äôs ‚Äúclean‚Äù, so says Biden
Actually it was Bush and the GOP that bailed out WS, banks and AIG. Then handed Obama &amp; Biden a mess that took years to restore and handed a booming economy to trump enjoyed and ran in the ditch. You say you are for limited gov. does that include the secret police gassing 1/2
We have always had to decide who will give us a day in court or string us up!   Why it‚Äôs easy for me. #Biden  People had said vote like a Black woman. It ain‚Äôt cause we live for Biden or the D.  We use to not getting to home plate on the first second third or fourth bat!

That is all the more reason you should be pissed at trump's incompetence. I'm guessing you weren't in biz in 2008 when the GOP crashed the economy, Just before Obama and Biden took over and bailed us out. And god damn if the republicans haven't done it again.
It's safe to say Biden's VP will not be trashed by the press in the same way Mike Pence was in 2016.
President Obama &amp; VP Biden, brought back the economy bush ran into the ground,  worst recession since the great depression, and handed off to trump and it was booming. trump's incompetence and refusal to act in a global pandemic has resulted in the total crashing of the economy.
Can you not say vote for Biden?
Obama and Biden fixed the mess the previous republican left. Our country was in turmoil banks and businesses needed a bailout to keep going under. Trump has increased the budget and had a hand in 150k deaths durin Covid. #TrumpVirusDeathToll150K
Safe and convenient way to vote is by mail. #VoteByMail #Vote #ByeDon2020 #Biden
I will vote Biden
Biden's support for law-and-order type legislation in the past is troubling, but the signaling coming out of his campaign is that his Administration will be guided by more progressive voices, so I view that with cautious optimism.
Regardless of what you try to say.  Once the virus came to America, it became your responsibility.  Oh, Commander-in-Chief.  You didn't deal/handle it.  It's all on you, not Biden.  This is real reality, not a show.
Obama Unleashes on Trump Privately as He Raises $24 Million for Biden
Billy, they will be suffering indigestion once January arrives and all of the clowns start sweating indictments. In fact, Biden should name Clinton AG. That would cause Trump to stroke out for sure.

Biden doesnt look like a rocket scientist even if compared to Don LeMon.
I really doubt they would. I‚Äôd assume they would pick some Senator who obviously doesn‚Äôt want it, who would then appoint Biden as VP and then resign.
Apparently the ‚Äútiming of the Zoom‚Äù only hinders Biden
The copy machines came in late for Joe. Biden is mentally unfit for Office, watch and listen carefully. He is near the ‚Äúpuppet‚Äù stage doing what his controllers tell him to do. Reallly sad.
He wasn't on the vp committee.
Well thats not happening. I wanted it to be Castro. But it is Biden. So there ya go.  You can pray, whine, and fuss all you want, but that is the battle.   So support who you will. Stay on the sidelines. Vote Trumpy. My choice is clear. Support DACA, support public option.

You owe Joe Biden an apology.
So true. Yet Tulsi stayed in longer then everyone else except Bernie and Biden and only got 2 delegates. They honestly just embarrass themselves
Have you apologized to Biden yet?
I will vote for Joe Biden November 3rd. #WeWillVote
Looks like that tweet in April that Biden said Trumps would try to push back the election was right and you were wrong.
Trump is now suggesting delaying the November election.  Politically speaking, this would give him a chance to try to bounce back the economy before voters hit the polls, as he‚Äôs now trailing Biden by double digits.  However, he has no authority to do so.
Until now I have been pretty confident that Trump was going to win again. I am starting to think there is a "silent majority" building that will vote for Biden instead of Trump and just not tell anyone. Even down here in the South.
Since what Ron Johnson is doing against Biden is counterintelligence directly related to Volume 5 and could be in that volume, discussions of his efforts by Congress in the last few days should be seen as part of a larger Volume 5 effort.
They've been discussing Ron Johnson's efforts to import Russian disinformation into the effort against Biden, but Volume 5 is certainly related, so it could be both.
A delayed election will only lead to a delayed end to the pandemic shutdown. The Democrats need America in disarray to keep Biden off the debate stage until they election.

Extreme Embarrassment to our country &amp; the rule of law.  Dems call a lynching without a rope - almost as dumb as a candidate for Pres without a brain. Why would Dems ever put this in Nadler's hands? Or worse, in Biden's?
I don't understand. It's happening now under trump. We haven't even elected President Biden, yet. I guess this is President Obama's fault. The virus, economy, unemployment... Is it still 2020???
You do know that Joe Biden ran in 2008 (the same year as Obama) and didn‚Äôt win any delegates either which is why he dropped out so early. And still became Obama‚Äôs VP. Not to much of a difference with Kamala
hey kamaaalaaaa...you sleeping with Biden now???  Did you get the part???!!
I'm 100% convinced that this was a trump card in the last debate against Bernie. Whatever chance Bernie still had when Biden said this, it evaporated. It hit the exact right lib notes, and I'm mad Bernie didn't beat him to it.
I was gonna say, did someone find a plot to off Biden or something?? WTH??

Disagree in strategy Tom. If elected,  Biden is a 1 term president. He has 2 jobs: 1) stop the trainwreck 2) pick the next President as his VP.   I don't think Kamala checks off #2.

A Potential Susan Rice Pick Raises More Questions About Hunter Biden's Burisma Ties

If Biden now has all the answers on how to ‚Äúfix‚Äù America, why didn‚Äôt he (as VP) share them with Obama during the Great Recession that drug on for 8 years?? Also, where are all of his legislative successes in a 36 year Senate career (other than enriching his family)??

neolibs if biden gets elected
Ironic when that same nominee has ran for the office three times himself.   Additionally, Biden has already said that he‚Äôd be a one term President. Some NEEDS to be ambitious for 2024.   This train of thought is maddening.
Biden/Harris or Biden/Warren whatever, Never Trump.
That blank look on Biden is why they bar him from the car keys
I am starting to believe that Biden is being taken advantage of.  As financial reps we have to look for signs of elder abuse.  He is making statements and taking stances that are contrary to his past and being led around and scripted.  He‚Äôs diminished and being coerced.
Biden will help us trump is killing us
(bonus tweet)  And I wonder if this decision isn't an attempt to secure the votes of suburban folks who are being swayed toward Biden for the upcoming election.

If Biden embraced Single Payer healthcare, he would have EVERY Bernie bro standing behind him.  He can't and won't  because of his dealings with the insurance industry.  They painted the mere idea of Single Payer Healthcare a FAR LEFT Socialist idea, and The D base bought it.

IT'S A JOE BIDEN ECHO CHAMBER!
He said that he was not going to vote for Biden three months ago.  There is no outreach here.  Just watching a grown person through a tantrum.  Over.  and Over.  and Over.
You have now said 39 times you will not be voting for Biden.  Ok we got it. You are not going to vote for Biden.
I loved Reagan also, but this is Biden starting where Reagan also.  He is out of it
He is now not voting for Biden 39 times.
Reagan was 77 years, 349 days old when he left office in 1989, the oldest to ever serve.  Joe Biden will be 77 years, 348 days on election day, November 3rd.
Dude, this tweet is trying to make it a thing that someone was holding Biden‚Äôs arm while he walked. You can‚Äôt have it both ways.
Oh yeah. Biden‚Äôs got this. He can just coast home.
Reagan was 77 years, 349 days old when he left office in 1989, the oldest to ever serve.  Joe Biden will be 77 years, 348 days on election day, November 3rd.

Literally, Joe Biden actually asleep would do a better job than you.
As Joe Biden said, the Federal government is perfectly capable of removing trespassers.

Let me get this straight, all the polls showing him losing to Biden are ‚Äòfake‚Äô but the polls saying Fauci is more favorable he believes? To play victim? He can‚Äôt have this shit both ways.
Joe Biden been office 40 years can name a Socialist policy he has proposed?
So if Biden wins, Harris becomes our new President - just let that soak in for a moment - then either stay home or go vote for Trump.
Are Biden‚Äôs remarks scripted ?  Seems so.
Hate / Division / Fear = The Trump campaign model since 2015. I watched the entire 15 min Biden / Obama video and the entire message was, "We've got to work together &amp; find a way to relate to each other in order to get past these last 4 years."
Well you are currently doing whatever Putin wants, so I can‚Äôt see that Biden will be a problem.  Probably nobody likes you.  Oh, and you are still a traitor.
Just don't forget that the moment a multiracial coalition started to form was when Panther leadership was discredited and assassinated, then, and when the media coalesced around Biden, more recently. The mainstream coverage over the weekend was all "cops injured by angry mob."
I am voting for Biden
Biden says he will choose his running mate next week
She was who I originally wanted as the democratic nominee. So I supposed it‚Äôd be a bit of a consolation prize and still a historical first if they win. At this point, Biden could say he‚Äôs running with Screech from Saved By The Bell and I‚Äôd say ‚Äúit‚Äôs alright...‚Äùüòè
There was a lead story in the WaPo that twinned with Bedingfield said outlining the most Biden logic as to why it is going to be Kamala.

I was playing a game of heart on line and in between hand Biden is advertising, I deleted the game
For instance todays sighting: white woman disagrees with black cashier while i was at ups. They go back n forth, white woman reaches peak loudness and says: this is why im voting for trump. I hate you mother fuckers. I thought about voting for biden but yall dont deserve peace.
So I saw a pic of a room in the WH that Melania had redone and whooooooo boy it‚Äôs gonna take Jill Biden a long time to fix all that shit.
Trump will win because at the first debate Biden will close with  It would be my honor to be President of the United States of ...... of ......um ..........um.... well whoopty got damndy doo
Finally Got my first Biden YouTube ad!!!! I cannot tell you how I have suffered under the onslaught of trump ads and surveys that seem to not recon with my viewing habits.
If   picks this loser #Republicans should be sure to get #TulsiGabbard  on the front row of ANY debate #KamalaHarris has the nerve to try with  . I believe this woman has way more baggage than the #Biden campaign can carry right now! That stench from her debate stuck.
Im with you.  I just hope Biden nominates a running mate that inspires some hope.
As much as I dislike Trump, I can‚Äôt say that I would feel any better if Biden was to win.  ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è   I‚Äôm kinda already use to one of these fools.  Bernie would‚Äôve had my vote 100% tho.  I got luv for that dude.
Too easy? Where has Biden been? Not answering questions, avoiding press, trying to remember he‚Äôs running for office. All‚Äôs well. I hope you guys are all staying safe.

I mean treating the protestors like actual enemies of the state and using the actual military, like Trump threatened early on, not just National Guard. I feel like a ‚ÄúTiananmen Square‚Äù moment is more likely under Trump than Biden.
Juan, You are horrible. Fox News please let him gone. He needs to rest before his mind is completely like Biden.
Is it just me or did Joe Biden look EXCEPTIONALLY alert during today's new conference?  Check out those WIDE open eyes #JoeBiden
Biden has run a superb campaign thus far
can we be honest Joe biden or  Donald "Tiny Hands" is the right people for the country, so you dont gain anything about bashing the other guy they both terrible, Trump is idiot and Joe might be having a little dementia playing here.. so either way we all Fu**ed
im not fan of joe biden but the man not even in office yet.. this is white america problem vote same republicans in office over and over and what  you got show for it  big tax cuts for the wealthy and second amendment  babble about don't tread on me slogans.
Listen to Vice President Biden's Build Back Better speech is like a breath of fresh air compared to trumps mumble through of the reading (which he can barely do) of his incoherent covid pep rally. which goes off the rails in tangent of ignorance.

If Trump refuses to leave, what are they gonna do, call the cops? ‚ÄúYes, hello, 911, this is Joe Biden. I‚Äôd like to report a dictator.‚Äù Trump is never going to admit defeat. He is not capable of it.
Biden is the nominee so I would argue the left never had the middle. Smartin‚Äô up Elon. Lol.

Oh look, it's another white man with an opinion. We must call Joe Biden and put you in touch!
If you still haven't decided whether to vote for Biden in November, even after the deaths of over 150,000 people from Covid, Vote for Trump already. This "he's got to earn it" bullshit is really old, and no one thinks you'll do the right thing anyway.

Some people do not need to bring up such pettiness. Do we need a dictator (Trump ) or do we need a person that is compassionate &amp; WON‚ÄôT let our Unite States be destroyed like it is being done today! Yes we need JOE BIDEN to run our country ( AMERICAN ) !!!
Radical left Joe Biden
AMEN AMEN!!!  We need someone named Joe Biden!!
Disappears from the media. Don't be surprised to see a sudden arrival of a vaccine either if Biden wins. All this mess is too coincidental for it NOT to be political.
If I were president I would show some balls and shake their hands!  He is a good president! ‚ô•Ô∏è  1000% better than Biden would be.  But he could be a better, more fearless leader if he choose to be this!
I will support any VP candidate Biden picks. And will be vigorous in my support.
Untold Truth: COVID-19 will last through to the election. If Biden wins, it disappears. If Trump wins, it stays. One-world government is the goal. If you don't believe politics is driving COVID, BLM, and Antifa, you're sleep! Why is ALL THIS MESS happening in an election year???
The conspiracy-theory hemisphere of my brain keeps telling me that **ump knows he's going to lose so he's making things as worse as possible to dig Biden a hole so deep that he can run on it in 2024

Well we know where you get your news from. I guess you prefer the looting, burning, destruction, murder, mayhem going on vs Homeland Security detaining those responsible. I guess Biden and these progressive mayors are going to fix it, lol surely you don't believe that.
Hmm, the only other choice is Biden that is miles in the other direction from Reagan. You libtards don't understand that it has so much less to do with Trump than it has to do with Not Clinton and Not Biden. We're not just voting FOR Trump, we're voting AGAINST your ideology!!!

if Biden don‚Äôt keep the prophet‚Äôs name out of his crusty mouth I-
Biden shouldn't do anything to distract from Trump destroying himself.
This is TRUMP‚Äôs America, you created with your lack of leadership, hate speech and divide/conquer tactics. I donated to Joe Biden‚Äôs presidential campaign earlier today. Bring back decency to OUR White House. üíô Change is coming. #GestapoTrump
Basement Biden, still in hiding and ducking interviews. America will not tolerate a coward as President.
Lol!! The Republicans want voter ID. Which proves you are you and you voted for whoever. Dems want to send out mass ballots and no voter ID and your wondering why I said Dems. There is no way Biden could without mail in ballots. Unless rigged!!

President Biden, TEAR DOWN THAT WALL!!!
Biden campaign declines 'Fox News Sunday' interview, 1 week after Chris Wallace's Trump sitdown   ‚Å¶ Chris has got to ride Biden‚Äôs ass until he submits to an interview.
Just Biden my time until 11/3!
Nope. Just value what someone does vs what they say.  Biden had 40+ yrs to impact Black lives &amp; didn‚Äôt. Trump funded HBCUs, minority businesses, &amp; had lowest black unemployment pre-pandemic. At some point 1 has to realize how they‚Äôve been voting for 40 yrs ain‚Äôt working for them.
So, do you know if your plan is Biden's plan?
The man wants to be President but he won‚Äôt even take a question   Biden is a joke
Biden is a pederass. Mail in voting is a scam. Those for it know it is the easiest way to cheat. Using fake tenants to get extra ballots, votes being thrown in the dumpster. Hundreds of ballots are found lost or thrown out. It's a complete scam. Lefties continue to destroy the US
Biden's path to the White House could hit a dead end on Facebook
Biden, Dr Fauci and the governors should come up with a plan. All they would need from Trump is a pledge not to sabotage it.
Biden, what a joke. He is afraid to do an interview withChris Wallace. If he can‚Äôt handle this, he can‚Äôt handle being President.
the Empress is tired and confused.  She doesn't understand that Trump can take unscripted questions for 2 hours without notes and Biden can't get through a scripted interview with screwing up.   but good try my dear.
Exactly. I have zipped my lip since Warren dropped out. I cant manage to get excited by Biden but whatever. My vote will count the same regardless. They best lay off AOC, though. üôÑ
Biden has been a Senator for 40 years and VP for 8.  Dude had almost 50 years &amp; did nothing but suddenly going to do something now?
Did you get that from your huge 19 person turnout.  Good luck Herbert Biden.
Not sure why Black folks would vote for Biden.  Sponsored the crime bill in 90s. His justification was he didn‚Äôt want his kids growing up in a ‚Äújungle‚Äù. Also on video using the n word.  Google is your friend- use it.  No way you vote for this imbecile if you‚Äôre  informed.
This will be in every city if Biden is elected!
Are you sure it's not democrats.. They did start impeachment trails a day of the China trade agreement!! You know Hunter BIDEN got 1.5 billion from China
Far more likely that Biden is a better partner to our allies and the freer world in gen. Putin has less control. That's appeal of the Donald; water boy who thinks he's 1st string.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.

How can Joe Biden handle being president when he cannot handle an interview with Chris Wallace
Fake polls.. The only thing Biden will win in 2020 are fake polls
And yet, Biden is beating you in the polls in Arizona ‚Äì which is a state a Democrat hasn't won in forever, loser.
Why would you stop being critical of Biden? Does anybody really know.  Maybe there is something in it for you? Only time will tell.
Mark supports Trump in the general. The primary is over. Bernie endorsed Biden. Mark endorsed Trump.
Yes their idea of the end is very odd. How can they see danger in Biden but not in Trump?!!!
No true Republican could ever, EVER vote for Joe Biden.
I don‚Äôt.  Biden is comfortable enough in lead that he will go for the safe choice. But he can‚Äôt go with a moderate white woman, because that would be a bridge too far.  Harris has high levels of support in Black community as a whole, it‚Äôs the younger voters against her.
My 70 year old parents, sister and brother in law have always voted republican and this year they are voting for Joe Biden. Change is coming! Suck it up buttercup
Careful kiddies, the Obama excrement is surfacing and some around him may need to leave the Country. Damping evidence has been shown since last year... and we know about Biden.
Fuck Biden 2020
Sen.  you seem to be a fan favorite amongst many contenders for the Veep spot on the Biden ticket. Would you care to put us out of our misery and share if it will indeed be you or not? Maybe even what your chances might be, if you can't say with certainty.
What brings you to this conclusion? Also, do you think that will help or hurt Biden's chances?
Biden has been a Congressman for 40 plus years.
Almost Every policy Joe Biden is trying to repeal, are policies he signed and help place into law. He‚Äôs a huge contributer to the marginalization in America. But leftist would never murmur, the facts of the accusation.
But how do we break it, Brit? It even goes largely unreported by Fox who is stuck on 24 hr Covid &amp; Antifa/BLM coverage with a Biden story thrown in briefly between.  Particularly,  has had some great, yet largely ignored pieces.  Get your heads together &amp; get it out.
WRONG!! He wants to cut more but he needs democrat votes.. &amp; you will gladly take the tax cuts &amp; still vote for BIDEN because of insanity
I‚Äôm voting for Joe Biden. #ResistanceTaskForce
This election is important and i believe a pedophile shouldn‚Äôt be able to lead a country. Which Joe Biden by video evidence totally is. You might be okay with pedos but I‚Äôm not.
Biden will probably select a former prosecutor (super cop) as his VP. I didn‚Äôt think she was even liked among rank and file democrats. Some say Susan Rice, but that would be a tough sell, she was the Benghazi lady who said it was caused by a provocative video on YouTube.
This announcement coincides with the final day of early voting here. What are your guesses for Biden's running mate selection?
I‚Äôm having internal struggles right now with a close relative who thinks people who protest online just think ‚Äúeverything in the world is wrong‚Äù. They are not a trump supporter per se but they won‚Äôt vote Biden because of liberal ideology. What‚Äôs the other choice?????

I tell you something that concerns me a lot. I am voting for Biden but I have not seen a single Biden yard sign but plenty of Trump signs and even a billboard or two.
More of the same if Biden gets elected. You're fooling yourself if you think he'll be different.
we must defeat trump at all costs, the worst president of all time, the source of all evil etc etc etc, but can anyone actually tell me *policy* prescriptions (not platitudes like ‚Äúhe believes in sCiEnCe!!) of biden‚Äôs that would change the state of things AT ALL
the real story is that biden‚Äôs team of advisors is made up of ‚Äò90s welfare reform sickos who reinforced this arrangement and wouldn‚Äôt run it any differently!
Right? They think the majority of Dems/Biden voters want to vote by mail. Nope. We just want the *option* available. I will be going to vote at my precinct.
Usually VP‚Äôs are selected in August. Biden secured the nomination abnormally early so it makes it seem like he should already have one.
ANTIFA has taken over and is hiding behind the #BlackLivesMatter movement. In addition, any money that goes to BLM ends up in Joe Biden‚Äôs campaign fund.
That NYC billionaire has donated his entire salary while he‚Äôs been potus!  Never has any other President done that!  Biden &amp; his family became millionaires, while he was VP!  Wake up!  #BidenIsARacist #bidenscognitivedecline
How is Trump working for you. Obviously you prefer a racist.  Who cares about friend or uncle. I am not thrilled with everything about Biden. I just never thought I would see you try to shift support to Trump.
That's FUNNY!! We deserve a president who won't allow his son to receive 1.5 billion from China for doing NOTHING! BIDEN used his office for personal gain for decades meaning he quit on us long along
I agree Biden doesn‚Äôt have to be your friend. If you feel Trump can move you closer to your goals for justice and equality .... carry on!!!
A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn‚Äôt pretty  via   So our Constitution no longer works?
I have a Joe Biden joke but I forgot what it was.
It's not a perfect upcoming election. I voted Bernie in the past 2 primaries &amp; Hillary in the last election. I'll vote Biden because he isn't a fucking monster. He won't be perfect but honestly he just has to have a pulse to be better than Trump.
Well gotta go. More important things to do like make some more Donald Trump posters. We have some large rallys coming up soon. Many Biden memes to make. To bad you're on the wrong side of the planet. Have you been practicing your Mandarin lately?

We all will be able to relax when Biden starts fixing what trump messed up
The man to do so is in the office, but these chicken shit governors are so scared of offending people when laws are being broken and lives threatened. Please tell me Kent you don‚Äôt think Biden is the answer?
To be clear, not voting for either major party candidates as they currently seem to be slotted. There is no good choice between Trump or Biden.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Yes no longer trust it until trump is gone and Biden fixes it
All he‚Äôs trying to fucking do is split votes from Biden... He thinks Black people are fucking ignorant. People need to boycott Kanye and everything he produces because he doesn‚Äôt give a damn about Blacks nor America.

Kanye West tweets he 'can beat Biden off of write ins'  #FoxNews
And Joe Biden spoke much of their slander against Blacks that the MSM is refusing to air during his time as a senator.
These must be charges against Biden because he supports China and he supported the spying on Trump both before and after the 2016 election.
I don‚Äôt like all of your politics, but you are a way better choice than Biden.
School Choice! Economy! US Manufacturing and Pharmaceutical Companies! Basically, what he has been trying to do, without the help of Congress...and just keep preaching how Biden has been in office half a Century and has done nothing!
GREAT! She's been my favorite from the beginning. If you didn't see her at work during the multiple senate hearings, you missed seeing someone who has everything it takes to be ready on Day 1.   Harris seen as Biden VP favorite as clock ticks
I'd rather end up on  lawn. Wouldn't want Biden to have to clean up the mess, right?

Fuck that sums him up perfectly! November can‚Äôt come soon enough! Blue wave is coming. Biden doesn‚Äôt even need to campaign. Trump is done sr done.
Don‚Äôt give Joe Biden any ideas.
does  know you want to beat Biden off?
The key to all of this is what happens on 11/3. Biden has already said in his 1st 100 days he is for ‚Äúexpanding the number of high-skilled visas and eliminating the limits on employment-based visas by country, which create unacceptably long backlogs.‚Äù
It's strange watching some of the same Black people who dislike Biden because of the 1994 Crime Bill praise Trump for unconstitutionally sending federal law enforcement into Chicago, "because something has to be done." Y'all so fickle.

No. But Quit calling Trump a racist if you arent gonna call out Biden...which is dishonest...thats all.

Great discussion. Will sway. I have voted D my whole life. So far, Biden is WAY too soft on CCP. The Chinese government is an existential threat to US and should be treated as such, IMO.
And I‚Äôm once again asking you to fucking run in the election so we don‚Äôt have bumble worded Biden or the walking Nickelodeon logo for four more fucking years but we don‚Äôt all get what we want, do we?!?
Do you understand Trump  loyalty base?The polls want us to think Biden is ahead. Most Americans do not want socialism which is where Dems are headed. It won't be Biden cuz he can't. It will have to be his VP or someone else that does biz. Sad his family lets him be embarrassed.
Joe sniffing hair publicly makes the claims against him much more credible. He's openly pedophillic and perverted, Trump is not. Biden's actions make claims against him much more credible.

Oh yeah he will!! I mean there can‚Äôt be that many dumbasses in the country to vote Biden.

Who are you talking to? I said Biden was racist. You're convincing me of something I already know. Now I'm asking you to admit that Trump is openly and obviously racist
But work for Biden and the Democrats like they were all behind!
Trump must declare a national emergency and arrest all Dem leaders that are leading and coordinating behind the scenes this insurgency. This would include Mayors, Governors, Dem House Reps, Dem Senators, also include Pelosi, Obama, Biden, and the Clintons. They are all traitors.

Business outside the country is legal!! But China does own you.. ..like they own BIDEN! Democrats get foreign FUNDING paid to their children
Do we have any reason to believe Biden will remove secret police from cities? He supports more funding for police and has proposed no legislation for curbing their unchecked authority. I think people just want to pretend like he won‚Äôt be equally as authoritarian as Trump.

It was Trump who initiated the travel ban from China (end of January) and then Europe but Nancy was telling everyone to go to Chinatown (end of February) and Biden said Trump was fear-mongering and xenophobic for doing it.

I'm convinced trump &amp; McConnell have already stolen the election. Biden will get 5 - 10 MILLION more votes, but trump will easily win the EC. Rigged voting machines, voter suppression, and foreign hacking will make the "win" plausible. This is Putin's plan. What will we do then?
Trump campaign turns tables on Biden claim that president is racist |
Remember the Sanders spin... Obama hates Biden.
Yeah, if this is Biden‚Äôs America, how come it‚Äôs happening under Trump? It‚Äôs almost as if it‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs America.
Danny lay off RoadDogg! You must be a Biden Suppoorter
Trump has a core of voters who stick. Those are the only ones Trump can rally. They'd stay with Pence in any case, and Pence could attract disaffected Republicans (and some Independents) who loathe Trump to the point of not voting, or voting for Biden.
islam IS islamüèîÔ∏èSubversive Of Society. What it that Biden does not understand about destroying America?üòá
The sad thing is: If Biden ran in 2016 I think he would have won
Watch Hannity from last night if you want to learn about Biden's record on Civil Rights. Starts at 13:47.
You know as much about women as BIDEN knows about his family making millions off his government office!! Like in Ukraine
Biden Could Quickly Reverse Trump‚Äôs Military Transgender Ban, Group Says
Biden will be an absolute disaster. He has been on the wrong side of debates for as long as he has been in politics, from busing to marriage equality. One of the most corrupt people in politics, enriching his family off the backs of the American people for 50 years. #VoteGold

Trump doesn't give a Damn about our Veterans. But, Joe Biden does!! #JoeBidenForPresident2020
At the time, sadly that was not considered racist. It was an acceptable norm. Biden is right that Trump is the first openly racist (meaning socially abhorrent) candidate and president. It's "supposed" to be unacceptable at this time.
WTF... The article paraphrased Biden's comments and added quotation marks.   This is a not only a misquote but a total lie. Biden obviously never said it.
It's sad how far America has fallen. We are a joke to the entire world because of Trump  Biden may not be as sharp as he once was but he's still a better choice for President than #TraitorTrump  Trump brags about passing a dementia test &amp; let's Russia put bounties on the military
So if Biden, whose mental health is definitely on the decline, wins the first woman president will have gotten into office based on technicality?
So Biden chooses to ignore Woodrow Wilson and LBJ?  Both Democrats.  And how about himself?  He is also quite the racist, is he not?
How pathetic Biden hides in his basement from America. He is scared to come out because he might screw up. He lets his campaign aides write his tweets he is only to glad to plagiarize.
Yes it‚Äôs a plain miss. It speaks to the plain door liberals have to the racists history of this country and it‚Äôs leadership. BUT ..Biden would STILL BE better that 45.  We can fix him after his election.
politicians are dumb AS HELL   how are you gonna say ‚Äúthis would be biden‚Äôs america‚Äù while literally showing footage of trump‚Äôs failing america?? make it make sense. i‚Äôm waiting
And you know this how, Jack. You're not a neurologist, but an eye doc by training. So what qualifies YOU to cast such a medical opinion. Thought you were talking about #SleepyJoe Biden, actually. Your shoe fits that iteration...Clyburn will take Biden to the White house.  He will be on media along with Obama.  Let's March for our future!
Florida Teen Behind Mass Twitter Hack Including Kim Kardashian, Joe Biden, Arrested:
I always wondered how someone like Joe Biden can become mega-rich on a meager government salary.  This is the reason.  We need a revolution.
You are 100% right! But only because you will never make it to your inauguration. Your senility will cause your disqualification. So, after Obama speech today, my money for Biden VP is either Susan Rice or Loretta Lynch. #obamaneverleft #obamaneveragain
Agreed, so start the same structure 3 weeks before Election Day. People need not be confused-Biden is in no shape to debate. I was just giving it the benefit of the doubt. It is very likely should Biden win, he will never be inaugurated. VP pick will tell us all we need to knowüò¨
And Biden doesn‚Äôt have dimentia lol
Why would we listen, when we already know what you have to say.   Trump bad. Biden good.   I have nothing against you, but you simply aren‚Äôt interesting.
The 2016 election was the most FRAUDULENT and INACCURATE in history.  It still is a great embarrassment to the USA!  Let‚Äôs speed up election 2020 so that you may go away!  #Biden #thursdaymorning #Biden2020Landslide #ToodlesTrump
Voter fraud...  Yeah!  That‚Äôs the ticket.  #Biden #thursdaymorning #TrumpKnewAndDidNothing
Biden is gonna lose 40 States, the House and 5 Senate seats....
Can MS Obama please be the VP just for a little while? Maybe a year or two? That would seal the deal for Biden. We can‚Äôt take chances now. Trump and the  are going to cheat. üôè
EXACTLY!  To be honest, I think Trump is a pompous prick and never liked him. I never watched his show and always thought he had a punchable face.  BUT he has my vote for president because he is better than Biden.  He's done some good and a lot of bad, and I'll call him on all.
Trump supporters are too blinded by allegiance to admit that he started the lockdowns and is the driver for mandatory Covid vaccinations.  I‚Äôm voting for the guy because Biden BUT let‚Äôs be honest, he kinda sucks.
1 step farther out of touch? Diaper Boy Joe Biden
Yet small business are still shut down and business owners are getting arrested.  Trump started the lockdowns. How's that curve going?  I am voting for Trump, but don't act like he doesn't suck. Biden just sucks more.
Actually this is Trump's America.  People keep saying this is how it will be with Biden. Well, it's like that now.  Trump is weak and is too busy sparring on Twitter to do any real work.   I am over it. Voting  2020.

We believe in competence, embodied by one who will execute what he promises to try to improve America for all, of any background--so we'll vote for Trump. Despite what you state, the reality is Pres. Trump is a clear choice to pursuit of happiness. Biden=more taxes, less freedom
